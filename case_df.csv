lot more care in making any statement to promote themselves.

My decision on costs is as follows.  I think there are three components of the costs.  First of all, the costs of issuing the summons
itself.  There is no dispute that they should be paid by the plaintiffs.  In relation to the costs thrown away by the adjournment,
I will order the plaintiffs to pay those costs on an indemnity basis. 
36.  In relation to the hearing of the summons, I think that the additional hearing today has largely been necessitated by the plaintiffs’
failure to investigate the position regarding videolink which I would have thought was fundamental for an application of this nature.
 So the costs of the additional hearing should be borne by the plaintiffs but otherwise I will make no order as to the costs of the
hearing of the summons, on the basis that although the plaintiffs are ultimately successful in getting the order for vacating the
trial date and the adjournment of the trial, it is very much a matter of indulgence of the Court.  Given the circumstances including
in particular the timing of the application, I am satisfied that the defendants have acted reasonably in putting forward material
information and appearing on the hearing of the summons to apprise the court of all relevant matters.  The costs ordered are to be
paid forthwith rather than in any event. ",Dates of Hearing: 17 and 22 January 2013Date of Judgment: 22 January 2013,"(Godfrey Lam)

As mentioned above, the facts of this case revealed two serious offences committed by the Appellant.  No doubt, it is disheartening
to see a police officer with 19 years’ service going to jail himself.  However, I do not regard the sentences imposed by the magistrate

One option which the magistrate appears not to have considered is the imposition of a conditional discharge pursuant to the provisions
of s. 36(1)(b) of the Magistrate's Ordinance, Cap. 227. Such a course achieves the same effect as a suspended sentence in many ways, especially by providing an incentive to the
appellant not to reoffend but without the necessity of imposing a period of imprisonment at this stage.
47.  The appeal against sentence is allowed. For the suspended period of imprisonment there is imposed an order that the appellant is
to enter into a recognisance in the sum of $1000.00 to abstain from committing any criminal offence involving dishonesty and to appear
for sentence when called upon at any time within a period of two years from the date of this order.","SUBASINGHE MUDIYANESELAGE NANDIKA PIYAL

Advance Limited","47.  As a parting shot the opposing creditors submit that if the Court orders a winding up of the Company it should appoint different
liquidators in order to avoid any conflict in determining how any inconsistency in the statutory regimes in the 2 jurisdictions,
or in the interest of creditors in the different jurisdictions, should be addressed. This is a surprising submission for the opposing
creditors to advance at this stage given the fact that it was they who proposed that the BVI liquidators be appointed provisional
liquidators.  Given their obvious siding with Ms Chen in circumstances in which one would expect a bona fide creditor to be troubled both by the insolvency of the Company and Ms Chen’s reluctance to assist the BVI Liquidators it sounds
very much as if this is an attempt simply to place another barrier in the way of the efficient progress of the liquidation by increasing
costs and delay.  In any event even if conflicts arose this can be dealt with simply by appointing an additional liquidator in one
or both of the jurisdictions, as is commonly done, who can deal with any contentious matters.  In the present case I can see no substantive
reason for thinking that if a conflict between the two regimes arises it cannot sensibly and fairly dealt with in this manner.

Since the CJR, the courts have endeavoured to make it clear that parties are expected to carefully and thoroughly consider from
an early stage all steps leading up to trial, and not to wait until the eve of trial before making last minute interlocutory applications.
 A late application in the absence of a good explanation may be dismissed on the basis of delay alone (see eg paragraph 34 of PD
5.2), without evidence of prejudice to the opponent.  The prejudice to timely and efficient disposal of trials, the waste of court
resources and time, and prejudice to other more deserving litigants are sufficient.  To allow the plaintiffs here to sit on their
case and then to make last minute interlocutory applications, literally when they are at the door of the Court, for amendment, for
joinder of parties, for leave to adduce expert evidence, and now to appeal, would be defeating all the objectives of and changes
aimed to be made since the CJR, and should not be tolerated.

it is in the interests of justice to order cross-examination of Mr Leung.
27.  It is up to the Plaintiff, not this court, to formulate the scope of its cross-examination. In a writ action, the scope is largely
defined by the issues raised in the pleadings. This is not a writ action and there are no pleadings. In order to minimise surprise
and promote a sense of reasonable proportion and procedural economy in the conduct of these proceedings, this court also considers
it appropriate to direct the parties to exchange lists of factual issues arising from the Affirmation, and if possible come up with

As regards the third category which consists of the certificate, it was said that it was prompted by the challenge to quantum which
was first made in the skeleton argument.  But to succeed in its action, the plaintiff has to satisfy the court that the sum claimed
is due.  To that end, §§ 13-22 of the first affirmation of Mr Lee were directed at explaining the elements of the sum claimed.
 Since under the terms of the guarantees the certificate once duly issued is conclusive in the absence of fraud or manifest error,
there was no reason why such a certificate (which would have pre-empted any challenge to quantum) could not have been procured and
exhibited.  I am not persuaded that in respect of the certificate the first condition has also been satisfied.

Notwithstanding that the plaintiffs claim in tort, these claims arise out of complex commercial transactions involving substantial

Evercheer says that the Liquidators have misunderstood the calculation they were given.  Mr Yuen points out that the sum of HK$41,283,116
represents the balance payable in respect of a distribution of 50% of the dividends deposited with the High Court in connection with
HCCL 97 of 2000 as demonstrated by the correspondence included with the Updated Proof of Debt and that the reference to interest
is simply the interest that had accrued on this sum while deposited in the High Court.  Evercheer had included in its Updated Proof
of Debt the 50% that it did not receive.  Precisely what element is interest is unclear.  However, I agree with Mr Yuen that this
is irrelevant as all Evercheer has claimed is the sum that it would have received but for the distribution of 50% of the Investors’
Escrow Dividends to Investors.

that late applications may be dismissed on the basis of delay alone. Unless there are exceptional circumstances and there are good
reasons for the delay, one should not expect the courts to grant any late applications taken out shortly before the PTR.  This is
the case even if the applications have satisfied all the other threshold requirements for the granting of the relevant orders.  Practitioners
should therefore give serious thought about the question relating to outstanding interlocutory applications when they fill in the
listing questionnaires before the case is set down for trial, otherwise they only have themselves to blame if their late applications

The defendant could well have protected itself from any exorbitant or excessive claim as well as from the costs of pursuing such
exorbitant claim by making an adequate sanctioned payment into court.  The defendant appears to be financially capable of paying
a sum into court that can slightly exceed of the award I may make in favour of the plaintiff.  That is the protection offered by
the RHC.  The present application is a second bite at the cherry, upon the failure to avail itself of the protection by way of the
sanctioned payment.  Nothing prevents the defendant from doing so, subject of course to the court being satisfied as to its justification.
 I am, however, not so satisfied. 
29. This application to vary the costs order nisi is therefore dismissed.  I order that the costs of this application be paid by the

Wong’s standing, is a factor that should be taken into account in favour of the present application.  I would think that it would
be a rare case indeed in which the identity of the personalities involved could be a factor in favour of admission of overseas counsel.
 Similarly, the fact that the public is interested in a case in a general sense (for example because it involves celebrities, or
sensational or lurid facts) would rarely, if ever, be a factor in favour of admission of overseas counsel.  I do not regard the decision
of Cheung CJHC in Re Perry [2012] HKCFI 1849; [2013] 1 HKLRD 145 as being based on considerations relating to the standing of the persons charged – rather, as Cheung CJHC made clear in paragraph
14 of his judgment, the position of the defendants involved gave the case considerable significance for the integrity and reputation
of, and confidence in, the Government, and in the fairness of the operation of a market sector of major importance in Hong Kong,
and it was this that meant that there was a real public interest in the conduct of the case that justified the admission of overseas
counsel of high standing.
19.  In the event, for the reasons which I have given, I have concluded that it would be right to admit Ms Montgomery to deal with this
matter.  Although such reasons arise in relation only to Charge 4, it seems to me that as the other charges will be dealt with at
the same hearing, and the Review will almost inevitably be dealt with at the same time as the Appeal, it would in my view be appropriate
to admit her to deal with all aspects of the Appeal and the Review.  Accordingly I shall allow the application in full, and make
an order in terms of the Notice of Motion.  As is usual in such cases, I propose to make no order as to costs.",Date of Hearing: 2 May 2013Date of Handing Down Judgment: 15 May 2013,"(Aarif Barma)

also pointed to the fact that at the request of the Respondents directions were made for the filing of evidence and that such evidence
has played no role in the argument before me, because Mr Kwok quite properly accepted that this was not a case in which it was appropriate
to delve into the merits of the case.

taken prompt remedial steps to approach the Ds or apply to the court for adjustment of the Premium Undertaking or utilisation of
the monies of the UMAH with the banks to pay the 3rd Premium, I find the Ds were justified in taking out the Discharge Summons.  It is therefore inappropriate to grant the entirety of
the costs of such summons to be costs in the cause.  Nevertheless, it is also inappropriate to grant costs directly in favour of
the Ds at this stage because the ultimate merits of the parties’ respective stance have yet to be determined.  The Ds should only

I have expressly stated in paragraph 23 that the documents must “form part of the records of the specified corporation’s affairs”.
 I asked Mr Mok to explain how in the present case element (3) of my description of what in practice would constitute “records
of the specified corporation” was problematic.  This resulted in a fairly lengthy discussion of whether or not there was in substance
a difference between the test which in very loose terms is formulated in the grounds of appeal and preferred by the Applicant, and
the way in which I have dealt with the issue I referred to above in paragraph 23 of my judgment.  Mr Mok as I understood it inclined
to the view, having given the matter further thought, partly as a result of the debate which had taken place before Recorder Coleman,
that perhaps there was not, and that in practice the better way for the Applicant to proceed would be to take advantage of paragraph
3 of my order if necessary, rather than pursue the appeal.  Mr Mok invited me to adjourn the present application for 14 days to give
his client the opportunity to consider whether or not to withdraw the appeal although he did withdraw the current application.  I
am not inclined to do that.

RE CHEUNG HOK CHOI [2013] HKCFI 1195; HCB 3629/2013 (29 July 2013),The creditor appeared in person,"9.  Thirdly, Mr Cheung has stated in his statement of affairs to the effect that he has no assets whatever, other than $100 in a bank
account.  He also said that he is now unemployed, having ceased to work for the Mainland company.  Yet he is stated to have monthly
expenditure of $8,500.  I am far from satisfied that Mr Cheung has disclosed fully to this court his financial position including
the source of funds for his living.  It is to be noted in this regard that the family court had concluded that Mr Cheung had concealed
from Madam Ho and from that court an unascertainable amount (but over $1 million worth) of assets: see paragraphs 44, 47 and 53 of
the judgment of Deputy District Judge Yim.
10.  Fourthly, Madam Ho, not unjustifiably in my view, is concerned that the bankruptcy petition has been presented by Mr Cheung with
the object of obstructing the transfer of the family home to her pursuant to the family court’s order.  Mr Lee, who appears for
the Official Receiver, stated that the order might have had the effect of constituting the family home a trust property held in favour of Madam Ho, in which case it would not fall
within the bankruptcy estate even if Mr Cheung was bankrupted (see s 43 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance), though he did not go so far as to suggest that this was a certain outcome.  In these circumstances, making a bankruptcy order would,
it seems to me, inevitably have the effect of complicating the transfer of the family home.  Such complication would be unwarranted

the question of any additional costs and time to be incurred by the Official Solicitor would not be of such significance as to tilt
the balance in my overall consideration of the matter.
29.  For all the above reasons, in particular the court’s preference for the appointment of a guardian in Hong Kong, who can be subject

Based on the facts of the case admitted by both the appellants, it was obvious that the 1st appellant committed the offences in the two groups of charges because staff member/members assigned to do the job were either not
suitable for handling matters concerning application for import and export licences or negligent and careless.  It was reflected
from the facts that the 1st appellant did apply for the export licences for the second batch of goods but only exported the goods after the export licences expired.
 The 2nd appellant, who delivered the goods for the 1st appellant without checking clearly as to whether the export licences submitted by the 1st appellant were valid or not,  was also negligent and careless.  I am of the view that the 1st appellant’s negligence or fault in the first group of charges is more serious than the 1st appellant’s in the second group of charges; and the 2nd appellant’s negligence or fault is less serious than the 1st appellant’s in the second group of charges.

deception, disregard of the law or breaking the law knowingly, and they frankly pleaded guilty.  Therefore, I consider the following

Cheng & Co, for the 1st and 2nd respondents","13. I accept that if the decision to wind up the Company had been left to the shareholders the result would have been the same.  However,
it seems to me that the following are determinative of the matter.  First, s 228A, uses very clear language and it is to be applied
strictly.  Unless a genuine reason exists for using its procedure rather than convening an extraordinary general meeting, it cannot
be used.  If it is wrongly used the resulting liquidation has been wrongly commenced.  Secondly, it is important that the requirement
for a company to hold meetings of members to decide important issues is respected. Members are entitled to be informed of important
matters affecting a company’s affairs (and there can be nothing more important than the suggestion that a company be wound up)
asking directors’ questions and exercising their voting rights.  Mr Lung’s submission amounts to a suggestion that those rights
can be ignored if the views of the majority are known and immutable.  I disagree.

It is an important feature here that, on my finding, the Authorisation had been duly signed by each of the plaintiffs before the
election expenses were incurred and that the only failure was to lodge it with the returning officer.  Further, I am satisfied that
Mr Lai and Mr Lo had acquainted themselves with the legal requirements, so it is not a case of their being reckless as to what their
obligations were as agents or assistants to the candidates.  I do not consider this to be a case of an applicant “turning a blind
eye” to the requirements of the law.  In my view this case may be distinguished from the case of Re Yiu Chun Fat, HCMP 1482/2007, 5 November 2007, to which I drew counsel’s attention at the hearing, where the applicant failed to file his election
return after the election because he “simply put this obligation of filing the election return as an item of very low priority”
and “simply did not care about it enough” (see para 9 of that judgment).  In my judgment, this is a case of a genuine inadvertent
omission to lodge a document which had already been prepared and signed.  While I would emphasise that it is important that an authorisation
should be served on the returning officer, so that it may, inter alia, be made available for public inspection, I consider it just in the circumstances of this case that the 1st and 7th plaintiffs should be relieved from the potential penalties and disqualifications that result from the act or omission in question.

in terms of substance and time taken for the argument, the plaintiff is the winner.  The plaintiff has in his letter in May 2013
told the defendant that he had no objection to the defendant’s alternative plea of qualified privilege.  I consider that the decision
should turn on the substance rather than on the number of items succeeded and the plaintiff is the substantive winner in this application.
 However, although Mr Chang submits that the plaintiff has good reasons to oppose the defendant’s cosmetic amendments, this is
not a valid reason to avoid costs if the plaintiff fails.  In Mr Chang’s written submissions, he has submitted his arguments over
the cosmetic amendments too. I consider that the plaintiff should have 90% of the costs of the application, including the costs reserved
and for today’s hearing (with counsel’s certificate) to be assessed summarily under Order 62 rule 9A RHC to be $54,000 to be
paid by the defendant within 14 days from the date hereof.

There is one other matter which needs to be addressed.  The factors to which I have referred to in paragraph 2 are things to which
the Court has regard in deciding whether or not to exercise its discretion.  It does not follow that because they are satisfied the
discretion should automatically be exercised.  Particularly where the application is retrospective, the breaches go back a considerable
period of time and remedying them is from the Court’s perspective largely academic there has to be some good reason for the Court
to exercise its discretion.  As I observed in Prime Sunlight ibid, and is echoed in the judgment of DHCJ Le Pichon in Re Array Electronics (China) Limited at paragraph 92, a prospective listing may be a reason for exercising the Court’s discretion but it is not necessarily so.  Determining
whether or not to exercise it will to some degree involve balancing on the one hand the extent to which the nature and duration of
the breaches make an application artificial and an unjustified imposition on the Court’s resources and on the other the consequences
of not making an order.  At present it is unclear to me what precisely the consequences of the Court refusing to grant an order are
for a prospective listing.  I have not had any evidence adduced in this or any other application which demonstrates that if the Court
does not make an order remedying breaches of sections 111 and 122 it will be fatal to the successful progress of a listing.  This,
and similar applications, seem to be made on the basis that it is easier to apply to Court for orders remedying breaches than address
the issue with the Stock Exchange.  Unfortunately this has resulted in a massive increase in the number of such applications in the

It seems to me that the above matters fully justified the Liquidator forming the view that he did.  I do not consider that Ms. Yeung’s
claim has any realistic prospect of success and I would dismiss the s276 Action.  I would, however, address one further matter which
bolsters that view.  The Liquidator also took into account that Japan Leasing was claiming $91,000,000 of which the Liquidator thought
that at least $27,000,000 was properly admitted.  I do not read Recorder Chan SC’s decision as depriving Japan Leasing of the right
to prove for these sums in the liquidation of the Company.  His decision only went to the point in time at which certain of those
claims could be admitted, namely, after the determination of the Action.  It seems to me that it was perfectly proper in considering
the offer for the Liquidator to take into account Japan Leasing’s claims and to assume that in part they would be admitted in due
course.  This being the case it seems to me that it becomes even harder to criticise the Liquidator.

In the case of the COI and Mr. Manapat I do not think that they did provide the court with much in the way of constructive assistance.
 However, the COI is the duly authorised representative body of the investors and creditors of the Company and they were entitled
to attend and make comprehensive submissions to the court if they so wished.  They did not seek an order that any part of their costs
should be paid out of the Subject Funds and they will bear their own costs.  I can see no basis for making them liable for any part
of the Liquidator’s costs and Ms. Lam did not seek an order that they should be. There will be no order as to the COI and Mr. Manapat’s
costs.
75.  Ms. Hong-Garcia’s position is different.  She actively opposed the application on grounds, which not only lack any merit, but
involved relying on a court order which had been obtained in questionable circumstances.  She, and the investors she represented,
adopted an adversarial position in respect of the Liquidator’s application with the consequences in my view that Ms. Hong-Garcia
should pay that part of the Liquidator’s costs attributable to dealing with the arguments she unsuccessfully advanced.  I will
make a costs order nisi to this effect which can be challenged by any party on giving written notice to the court within 14 clear days of the handing down

There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I have debated over the disposal of costs for resisting the application for
relief after the Relief Summons and the Relief Affirmation had been filed/served, but in the end bearing in mind the fact that in
the Relief Summons the plaintiff offered to pay costs of the application for relief from sanction (and Ms So did not resile from
such stance at the Hearing) and upon more mature consideration of all the circumstances, including the fact the plaintiff came to
court for indulgence, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff should pay the Ds their costs of the Relief Summons (including
all costs reserved if any) in any event to be taxed if not agreed, and D4’s own costs be taxed according to Legal Aid Regulations. I accordingly grant a costs order nisi to such effect.
56.  I note this is now two years after the issuance of the Writ of Summons. If at the 3rd CLR a brief hearing was scheduled to be heard shortly after 18 March 2013 (ie the deadline for the Ds to file affirmations to explain
when and what documents they received), say, in late March or in April 2013 instead of June 2013, such earlier hearing would have
elicited the fact that the Ds had received the Writ of Summons merely 11 days late. It would also have been useful on that occasion
to inform the unrepresented plaintiff of the statutory provision for relief from sanction under Order 2 rule 4 of the RHC.  Whether she would then choose to seek relief or not, the matter could have been swiftly dealt with on the basis of existing
affirmations to save time, minimise costs and achieve procedural economy for all concerned.  The court has a duty to proactively manage the litigation, and all parties including the Ds have a duty to assist the court to further the underlying objectives.  It
is hoped that the parties in this litigation will now re-focus their energies on moving the case along towards final disposal as
quickly as possible.",D E C I S I O N(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2014/495.html,"Mr Nic Chong, of Tsang, Chan & Wong, for the 1st defendant"

has certainly presented the petitions within the 12 years’ limitation period.  In such case, the unsubstantiated complaint of prejudice
is not a ground to justify the refusal of the granting of the bankruptcy order.

Before: Deputy High Court Judge Lok in Court


Date of Hearing: 19 March 2014
Date of Judgment: 19 March 2014

_______________
J U D G M E N T
_______________
 
1.  These are bankruptcy petitions against 2 individual debtors, and the bankruptcy debt is based on a judgment granted by the court
against the 2 debtors in HCMP 1621/2001 on 26 July 2001 (“the Judgment”).
2.  The petitioner is a bank.  The petitioner had advanced a mortgage loan to the 2 debtors.  In default of the repayment of the loan,
the petitioner obtained the Judgment against the 2 debtors on 26 July 2001. 
3.  The mortgage loan was secured by a property owned by the debtors (“the Property”).  As the debtors had failed to repay the judgment
sum, the petitioner sold the Property by auction on 28 January 2002.  The petitioner applied the sale proceeds as part of the repayment
of the sum due under the Judgment.  As the debtors had failed to repay the balance of the judgment sum, the petitioner caused 2 respective
statutory demands to be served on the debtors.  The present petitions are made based on these statutory demands.
4.  There is no dispute that the 2 debtors have not made any repayment of the sum claimed in the statutory demands or the balance of
the judgment sum.  However, the 2 debtors put forward the following 4 grounds to oppose the petitions.
5.  Firstly, section 4(4) of the Limitation Ordinance (Chapter 347) provides that:

“An action shall not be brought upon any judgment after the expiration of 12 years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable,
and no arrears of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which
the interest became due.”

6.  The debtors submit that as the petitioner has demanded for the repayment of the interests for the whole period after the Judgment
which included some of the interests which are time-barred, the statutory demands are defective.  It then follows that the petitions,
which are made based on these defective statutory demands, should be dismissed.  In support of such contention, the debtors rely
on the case of Re Debtor (21 of 1937)  [1938] Ch 694.
7.  I see no merit in such argument.  It is trite law that if there is debt which in part above the statutory minimum is indisputable,
a petition can validly be presented even if the debt as claimed in the petition is for a larger sum, part of which is bona fide disputed (see: Re Hong Kong Construction (Works) Ltd, unreported, HCCW 670 of 2002, decision of Kwan J (as he then was) on 7 January 2003 at para 6(5)).  If the debtors claim that the
petitioner is not entitled to recover the interests due for the whole period, such matter should be dealt with by the Official Receiver
when he is adjudicating upon the proof of debt lodged by the petitioner.  The statutory demands are therefore not defective and the
over-claiming of the interests in the statutory demands (even if that is the case) is not a ground for dismissing the petitions.
8.  Further, the case of Re Debtor cannot assist the debtors’ case.  The claims for the principal and interests in the Judgment are certainly divisible, and there
is no logical reason as to why a wrong calculation of the interests or a over-claiming of interests would affect the enforcement
of the principal under the judgment sum and the overdue interests which are not time-barred under section 4(4) of the Limitation Ordinance.
9.  Secondly, the debtors claim that they have a bona fide cross-claim against the petitioner as the latter had sold the Property at an undervalue.  In support of such contention, the debtors
rely on the fact that the purchaser at the auction sale was able to resell the Property at the premium of about 19% over the auction
price slightly more than one month after the auction sale of the Property.
10.  The principles in determining whether there is a bona fide cross-claim have been summaried by me in Re Wah Hing Stationery Manufactory Ltd, unreported, HCCW 73/2013, decision on 11 February 2014).  In short, the court should examine whether the cross-claim is genuine,
serious and of substance.  There must be supporting relevant details and evidence to demonstrate that the cross-claim is based on
substantial ground.  The court would caution itself against unsubstantiated and unparticularised assertions, and the court will always
approach the evidence adduced by the debtor with a critical eye.
11.  In support of the propriety of the auction sale of the Property which was conducted by a professional surveyors’ firm, the petitioner
has also provided the court with the following evidence including:

(1) the valuation report of the Property showing that the auction price ($950,000) was higher than the estimated restrictive realisation
price of the property ($800,000) at the time of the auction;
(2) the newspaper advertisements relating to the auction sale of the Property; and
(3) letters sent by the petitioner to the debtors informing the latter of the auction sale of the Property.

12.  On the other hand, the debtors have not adduced any evidence to substantiate the assertion that the Property had been sold at an
undervalue.  At the very least, I would expect the debtors to produce a valuation report to show the value of the Property at the
time of the auction. Further, property market is volatile in Hong Kong.  There might be a lot of reasons as to why the purchaser
was able to resell the Property at a premium a month after the auction sale, and this fact alone cannot indicates that the auction
sale was undervalue.  In particular, the auction sale had to be conducted on a forced-sale basis. 
13.  In a desperate attempt to oppose the petition, Ms Poon, counsel for the debtors, submits that the delay on the part of the petitioner
in prosecuting the bankruptcy proceedings had deprived the debtors from pursuing the claim for breach of duty or negligence against
the petitioner for selling the Property at an undervalue because of the 6 years’ limitation period.
14.  Again, this is a non-point.  The debtors do not need to make a positive claim against the petitioner.  They can simply rely on the
cross-claim as a ground to set-off the claim of the petitioner.  However, at least there should be proper evidence to support their
assertion that the auction sale price was an undervalue.  In the absence of a valuation report showing the value of the Property
at the time of the auction, the debtors’ allegation is just one without substance.
15.  Thirdly, the debtors submit that the petitioner should have applied the proceeds of the sale of the Property towards the repayment
of the principal first.  As the claim for some of the interests may be time-barred under section 4(4) of the Limitation Ordinance, this may reduce the quantum of the sum due under the Judgment.
16.  I again have to reject such argument.  First, the debtors cannot refer me to any authorities which supports the contention that
the petitioner should have applied the proceeds of sale to settle the principal first.  Second, even if the petitioner were to apply
the proceeds to settle the interests in arrears first, this would only reduce the quantum of the petitioner’s claim.  As I have
mentioned above, over-statement of the amount claimed in the statutory demands is not a ground for the dismissal of the petitions,
and such kind of dispute should be resolved by the Official Receiver when he is asked to adjudicate upon the proof of debt lodged
by the petitioner. Hence, there is no merit in such argument.
17.  Fourthly, the debtors complain that the delay in instituting the petitions is causing serious prejudice to them.  Whilst I agree
that there might be delay in the institution of the bankruptcy proceedings, the debtors cannot provide any particulars to substantiate
this complaint about prejudice.  Further, there is a 12 years’ limitation period for the enforcement of a judgment, and the petitioner
has certainly presented the petitions within the 12 years’ limitation period.  In such case, the unsubstantiated complaint of prejudice
is not a ground to justify the refusal of the granting of the bankruptcy order.
18.  As the debtors have failed to repay any of the amount claimed in the statutory demands or the balance of the judgment sum, and there
is no merit in any of the grounds put forward by the debtors to oppose the petitions, I make the usual bankruptcy order against both
debtors.

ECA Fund Board by the costs of proceedings to obtain a judgment for damages at common law, I direct that all such undefended cases
in the District Court be transferred to the High Court to be case managed by me as the Personal Injuries Judge and that all such
undefended cases in the High Court be also transferred to me to be case managed, until such time, as the ECA Fund Board decides to
intervene in the proceedings.  It will be my paramount task in the case management of these undefended proceedings to ensure that
the proceedings are brought to a conclusion, efficiently and economically, and I will expect solicitors acting for the injured employees,
or their dependants, in these cases to furnish me with the budget of the likely costs and disbursements to bring these undefended
cases to a conclusion.
73.  Whilst the risk of insurer insolvency is low, the failure of employers to purchase employees’ compensation liability insurance
is a real concern.  The assistance of the Business Registration Office might be sought to ensure that no business registration certificate
is issued unless the applicant provides details of a valid employees’ compensation liability insurance policy or declares that
he does not intend to employ any persons during the year to be covered by the business registration certificate.","Total

15.  That leaves the question of the basis upon which the 8th Defendant’s costs should be paid.  Mr Maurellet submitted that the 8th Defendant, who is not a director of the company, should clearly never have been joined and that she should have her costs paid by

matter should be delayed any further because the parties need to be aware of their position in order to prepare themselves for the
trial, if necessary. However, I do not think it would be right for me today to make an immediate order that the pre-trial review

13.  The defendant is effectively seeking an order by way of case management and in order to give effect to the master’s order for
security, that as a consequence of the failure to provide security, the trial should be vacated.  In the circumstances, I think it
would be fair to order that unless the plaintiff provides security for costs in compliance with the master’s order of 5 March 2014

In the circumstances, the Appeal is allowed and the case is remitted to the Tribunal for retrial before another adjudicator.  In
coming to such conclusion, I have carefully considered the spectre raised by Mr Hung of another 8-day retrial which he said would
be disproportionate given the nature of the claim. But the Part B Bonus as claimed is not a small amount, and a fair and just determination
requires proper adjudication on a principled basis as discussed above. I also bear in mind that the Part C Bonus is no longer part
of the retrial, and I have set out the parties’ respective contentions in some detail (with cross-references to the primary material)
in the hope they will assist the Tribunal to identify the relevant disputes and issues for the purpose of the retrial. It is unlikely
that the retrial with dedicated focus by both parties and the Tribunal on the relevant issues will require 8 days.

The defendant is a person with a clear record and I have received a plea of leniency from his wife and other testimonials as to his
overall good character.  At the time of his apprehension, he cooperated with the police and was frank and forthcoming when questioned
by them. I have taken these matters into account.  The most obvious and substantial mitigating factor is his plea of guilty which
he indicated at the earliest opportunity.  It is regretted that he has put himself and his family in this situation.  He has a young
wife with two young sons and there is no doubt that this will be difficult for them.  He should have thought of them before he embarked
in his criminal activities. 
6. There are two quantities of drugs involved－cocaine and ketamine.  The quantity of cocaine is 13.47 grammes and according to the
tariff in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370 the starting point for this quantity of drugs should be 5 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.  The total quantity of ketamine was
206 grammes and according to the tariff in S for J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1 the starting point for this quantity of drugs should be 7 years and 10 ½ months’ imprisonment. I will impose a sentence on the
defendant by taking a combined approach as explain on the authority of HKSAR v Yip Wai Yin and Anor [2004] HKCA 150; [2004] 3 HKC 367which requires that I look at the overall quantity of drugs in order to arrive an appropriate sentence for the cocktail of drugs involved
in this offence.  I will also take into account the personal circumstances of the defendant and his readiness to acknowledge to the
authorities and the court his wrongdoing.  Accordingly, I will impose a starting point which is slightly less than that which would
be normally given of 8 years’ imprisonment which I will reduce by one-third for his plea of guilty.  He is therefore sentenced
to 5 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2014/1399.html,"Ms Grace Chan, Senior Public Prosecutor, of the Department of Justice, for HKSAR"

First, practitioners are reminded to comply strictly with all relevant provisions of Practice Direction – 11.2 when making applications
for Mareva injunctions and Anton Piller orders, including the requirement to use the standard forms appended to that Practice Direction, which contain standard provisions
for the reasonable protection of the defendants.  The importance of using the standard forms, containing the protective provisions,
has to be understood in view of (inter alia) the following considerations:
37. Second, the defendant has not, as a matter of fact, complied with any part of the disclosure obligations contained in the Orders.
 When this matter was raised with the defendant’s counsel at the hearing, the initial response was that the Orders were ex parte ones and they were being challenged by way of inter partes summons.  It should be clearly understood that any order of the court, be it made ex parte or inter partes, carries the same legal effect and must be fully complied with.  If a defendant who has been served with an ex parte order considers that there are good or justifiable grounds for suspending the operation of the order (or any part thereof) pending
the hearing of an inter partes summons to vary or discharge it, in my view the proper course to adopt is to seek the plaintiff’s consent for a temporary suspension
of the order or, in the absence of such consent, make an urgent application, with notice to the plaintiff or his solicitors, to the
court for temporary relief.  The court will do what is just and reasonable in all the circumstances, and also take into account any
unreasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff or the defendant when deciding on the question of costs of the application.  In
this connection, I would remind practitioners of the duty of the parties and their legal representatives to assist the court to further

Firstly, I must point out that I do not have the power under O 32 r 5(3) to rehear the case because the Order has already been perfected.
 The court has jurisdiction under O 32 r 5(4) to restore a summons for rehearing.  However in the hearing on 29 July 2014, the court
mainly dealt with the application taken out by the defendants. Since such application was not taken out by the second-named plaintiff,
the one who failed to attend the hearing, the court has no power under O 32 r 5 to restore the defendant’s summons for rehearing.
6.  In relation to the second-named plaintiff’s summons, since he has already launched an appeal against the Order, the court will
not deal with his application.  Furthermore, the second-named plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation to justify his
absence in the hearing on 29 July 2014.  So for all these reasons, there is absolutely no merit in the second-named plaintiff’s

16.  Despite the submission of the 1st defendant, I take the view that, by pleading that it was contractually entitled to take over the works which are the subjects of

The plaintiffs mounted their claim on three grounds, being misrepresentation, estoppel and construction of the DMC.  They abandoned
their claim on the grounds of misrepresentation and estoppel.  This represented in my view a small part of the claim in terms of
time and effort in addressing these grounds throughout the proceedings.  This left the ground in relation to the construction of
the DMC, which was the major focus of the proceedings.  I felt that even though the defendant successfully resisted the ultimate
objective of the plaintiffs’ claim, it was challenged mainly on the proposition that I concluded was flawed.

Ms. Ismail sought to argue that whether or not the calculation involved identifying what value to input into a complex mathematical
model was not determinative.  She argued that the authorities show that where the parties to a contract agree a mechanism for determining
a payment then even if it involves a process which is in the nature of a valuation, rather than simply adding up figures, the result
is binding. Ms. Ismail relied on Socimer International Bank Ltd. (in liquidation) v Standard Bank Lond Ltd [6] and Peregrine Fixed Income Ltd v Robinson Department Stor1e Public Co Ltd [7].  As I understand the argument, the Provisional Liquidators contend that if one party’s valuation is binding then it follows that
the valuation is a liquidated debt.  The authorities to which Ms. Ismail referred do not address the issue, which was not relevant
to their determination, of whether or not a valuation carried out under such a contractual mechanism produced a figure that was properly
treated as a “liquidated debt ”.  What those cases do illustrate, particularly Socimer where there was a lengthy trial before Gloster J which involved a consideration of the valuation itself, is that provisions purporting
to give one party the right to value the consequences of the termination of futures contracts and swaps do not prevent an argument
about the valuation.
15. As I have already explained in my view the purpose of Rule 125 is to avoid a liquidator having to assess a claim which involves little
more than checking arithmetic in order to determine its veracity.  ASM’s claim in my view does involve more than that and thus
is a claim for an unliquidated debt for the purpose of Rule 125 and should, therefore, not be admitted for voting purposes.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2015/27.html,"Ms Roxanne Ismail SC and Mr Val Chow, instructed by Lipman Karas, for the Provisional Liquidators"

The 2nd defendant, Mr Tian, submits, through his counsel, Mr Sung, that even if the meeting is invalid for the reasons I have given above,
it is a mere irregularity and because the 2nd defendant is the majority shareholder, the court ought to ignore such irregularity.  But in my view, whether or not Mr Tian should,
in light of the settlement agreement and share transfer agreement, be regarded as the majority shareholder is very much in dispute.
 It seems to me the evidence relied on by the 2nd defendant on that question falls far short of what is required to persuade the court to determine in these proceedings, summarily
and without cross-examination, that Madam Yu has been in breach of the agreement.
39.  I should also mention that there was a faint suggestion that the agreements are void for illegality.  However, the point was raised
far too late.  In any event, I cannot see how the fact that some contract with a third party may be affected by a change in shareholding
of the group companies could give rise to illegality in this context.","TIAN YUCHEN (田宇晨)

Further, Mr Wong points out that the fact that Lung as a grown up man taking care of the financial affairs did not understand the
full effect of the 1999/2012 DOTs and/or other DOTs could not be a vitiating factor to invalidate such documents. He relies on Ming Shiu Chung & Ors. v Ming Shiu Sum & Ors. [2006] HKCFA 59;  (2006) 9 HKCFAR 334 per Ribeiro PJ at §§83-86. Again, I do not think Lung’s alleged lack of knowledge of the contents of the 1999 DOT forms any significant
part of his defence. The defence case is that Lung signed the 2012 DOT and any other DOTs at the request of MH for auditing purposes
only.
27. For the foregoing reasons given, Lung must be given unconditional leave to defend in respect of the claim of Wah Hing for the return
of the Fund. The contentions of Lung in respect of the Fund were already set out clearly in his original Defence dated 9 August 2013.

dismiss the Summons altogether and order that Wah Hing do forthwith pay Lung his costs of and occasioned by the Summons, to be taxed

from the lift and another woman, the alleged victim, is about to walk in to enter the lift, when the appellant holds up his left
hand with his open palm facing her as a gesture for her to stop and not enter.  She walks back and he gestures with his left hand
which is reached out not to come in and to go. It was then by the slightest of touches that he makes contact with the woman.  He
appears to press the close button and thereupon the lift door closes.  This woman gave evidence before the guilty plea was taken
from the appellant.  She said she was about to go inside the lift when the appellant used his hand to push her outside and the push
landed somewhere above her right breast.  She said that he said to her at the time “I am riding by myself”.  As far as I am concerned
it was not a push and there was no aggressive action by the appellant with his left hand.  It was simply a gesture not to come in
with his left hand reached out.  It was also clear that it was the slightest of contacts which occurred in less than a split-second.
 Whilst I can understand the woman being offended by not being let in the lift, there was no physical action by the appellant who
probably because of his mental state wanted to be left alone in the lift.  I should add that from the CCTV footage he was not behaving
in a physical or aggressive manner and was doing no more than putting his hand out as a gesture to the woman not to come into the
lift.  In my view, given the circumstances of the incident and the minimal contact if any involved, this did not support a criminal
conviction.

of agreed damages. In Hse Fei Lun, the administrator of the estate of Lam Chu Yuk, deceased v. So Suk Yee & Anor., HCPI 606/2012, 10 April 2014, I held that:
24. The outstanding matter on costs is the costs incurred by Madam Calinog on the issue of liability in HCPI 301/2012.  There are 2 aspects
of these costs to be dealt with: the pre-trial costs and the costs of the attendance by Mr Burke at the one day trial on liability.
 The 1st and 2nd defendants agree to pay the costs of the former to be taxed on a common fund basis provided that there is no duplication of the work
done by the solicitors of Madam Bibi.  They do not agree to pay the latter costs and rely on §42 of my decision handed down on 16
April 2014[11] in support of their stance.  Mr Burke has responded to those submissions by his submissions dated 4 November 2014[12], in the course of oral submissions at the hearing of the interim payment application on 16 December 2014, and by his letter dated
8 January 2015.  I direct the solicitors of the 1st and 2nd defendants to reply in writing to these submissions within 14 days’ of the receipt by them of the transcript of the hearing on
16 December 2014, so as to enable me to deal with this outstanding matter properly.","2012

Mr. Joffe explained the reason for applying for leave to commence a statutory derivative action rather than amending the existing
proceedings as follows.  The view is now taken that given what has taken place it may be appropriate to seek not just orders remedying
specific wrongful acts but orders of a type that are only available under section 725(1), for example, reconstituting the board.  In my view it is preferable that if a derivative action is to be prosecuted that it takes
the form of a statutory derivative action, subject to the leave of the court and with the wide discretion given to the Companies
Court under section 725(1) in crafting orders to cure unfair prejudice and mismanagement.  As the Court of Final Appeal observed in Waddington [12] it is not desirable that the 2 different regimes remain available.  All the time that they do there is a risk of the present question
having to be addressed as recognised by the inclusion of section 733(2)(a) which provides that the court may refuse an application if a shareholder has in the exercise of his common law rights brought proceedings
on behalf of the company in respect of the same cause or matter.  Ms. Chan argues that section 733(2)(a) reflects the idea that “[i]n the various situations which may arise where a party seeks to take advantage of the availability of both the statutory and the
common law derivative action, the court should exercise its powers, both express and inherent, to prevent the abuse of the court’s
process and to ensure that the dispute is resolved fairly and expeditiously without unnecessary procedural complications” [13]. I accept that it would be wrong, self‑evidently so, to allow both a common law derivative action and a statutory derivative action
to proceed at the same time.  This can be addressed by requiring the Applicants to undertake to apply for the withdrawal or dismissal
of the High Court Action before the order giving leave is perfected.
49. The question of the costs of the application and the derivative action were not addressed at the hearing before me.  I reserve those
issues and also give general liberty to apply.","Total

   for the defendant","9. Mr Bernard Chung, who appears on behalf of the defendant, has submitted in mitigation that the defendant is very remorseful for his
past misdeeds and has submitted a letter from the defendant in which he acknowledges the error of his ways and states that he desires
to improve his life in the future.  He asks to be treated leniently.  Mr Chung has also submitted letters from his two elder sisters
and a pastor and friends from the Hong Kong Evangelical Yan Lam Church.  They all speak favourably of the defendant.  He attended
the church at an early age and was regarded as a good-natured person who got on well with others and showed promise in his future
endeavours.  It is clear that he was well liked and respected within the church congregation.  I accept what has been said on his
behalf from his family and friends and given his young age and genuine expression of remorse and desire to change his ways, I will
impose as lenient a sentence as I can. 
10. The quantity of ketamine involved consisted of two amounts.  The first quantity of 210 g related to the large packet which the defendant
admitted he was delivering on behalf of others for reward. The second quantity of 8.42 g related to the small packet which I accept
was for self consumption.  I have decided that given the young age of the defendant and the potential future promise that I believe
he shows, I will sentence him as leniently as I possibly can.  The sentencing regime for trafficking in ketamine is governed by guidelines
laid down in S for J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1 and the starting point for the quantity of ketamine involved of 218.42 g is 8 years’ imprisonment.  Given that a small quantity
was for self-consumption, I will impose a starting point of 7 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  See HKSAR v Wong Suet-hau and Anor [2002] HKCA 183; [2002] 1 HKLRD 69.  The defendant has pleaded guilty for which he is entitled to a one-third discount and accordingly he is sentenced to 5 years and

in the fourth and fifth actions have also issued summonses for receivership dated 26 March 2015 and 18 May 2015 respectively returnable
before me on the same date, though as the jurisdictional issues had not been resolved until last week the two actions have not yet
been served.  They cover another 25,498 and 22,402 shares respectively in CSI (together 4.79%).  Ms Eu SC has sought to proceed with

solicitors should have appreciated before issuing the Petition that the Company had a substantial claim for costs and that until
those costs, and the Petitioner’s own costs, had been assessed there was sufficient doubt about what sum if any was payable to
the Petitioner that presenting a petition to wind up the Company was an inappropriate means by which to try and secure immediate
payment of the final award.  The speed with which a statutory demand was served suggests that a conscious decision was made to pressure
the Company by using the winding up procedure in circumstances which made it inappropriate.  This is the type of case in which the

the company failed to comply with the provisions of the Ordinance cannot fairly be categorised as inadvertence.  In paragraph 14
of the affirmation of Wang Luqjia, Ms Wang explains as follows:
3.  Something similar appears in the affirmation filed by the other director.  As I have explained on previous occasions, it is not
sufficient for directors simply to claim ignorance of the requirement of the Companies Ordinance in order to satisfy the court that they had made an inadvertent mistake.  Inadvertence arises where it can be shown that the directors
took steps appropriate for a director of a Hong Kong company to satisfy themselves of the regulatory requirements in which the company
was to operate.  Sometime directors do this but for reasons discussed in various authorities it is not made clear to them, for example,
that although the company has no active business in Hong Kong and does not have to file a tax return, it is necessary to prepare
audited financial statements.  This is not such a case.  It appears clear that the directors made no effort to get any kind of advice
in respect of their obligations.  In the circumstances it seems to me clear there are no matters upon which the court could reasonably
exercise its discretion and grants the application that has been made.  I therefore dismiss the originating summons with no order

are the funds and the question as to who is entitled to them.  It is on this basis that I cannot grant the variation to the injunction

It is not necessary for me on this application to say whether these beliefs and opinions of the liquidators are correct and valid.
 It is sufficient to note that it has not been suggested by Mr Sussex that they are not honestly held or that they lie so far outside

is too vague and incomplete to justify a departure from the practice of the Companies Court, namely, to proceed on the basis that
a winding-up order is relief of last resort and will not normally be granted in the face of an offer to buy out the Petitioner unless
good reason is established.  I also can see no reason for staying the winding-up relief rather than striking it out, which I order.
20.  I would end with this observation.  Part of the purpose of the Court producing judgments such as Re Sun Light Elastic and Re Health & Care Group Ltd is to make clear how a case for a winding up order should be formulated.  It is incumbent on practitioners to pay attention to them.

4th Respondent to transfer her 1/3 interest to the Petitioner and his Wife in a Flat that was tenanted as part of a broader division

with equal force in the present case.  Although it was desirable that a time period for completion be agreed I do not think that
it was essential.  The Parties could have proceeded on the basis that it take place within a reasonable period which would be the
average period for similar transfers and no reason has been given for suggesting that this would have caused a problem. In fact if

of $1.15 million were recovered.  I therefore find that the monies that purchased the Rolex watch came from the proceeds of the sale

with the requirement of company law that the councillors of the Koon, who are the persons mainly responsible for the operation of

It seems to me that the Court is entitled to expect all parties to litigation and, importantly, those advising them to approach proceedings
with a sense of proportion and mindful of the fact that the Court’s resources are limited and costly and that they should not be
engaged unnecessarily.  The Court recognises that litigation results from disagreements and that a degree of animosity between parties
is unfortunately going to arise on occasions and some account needs to be made for human nature in judging whether or not a party’s
conduct has gone beyond what is acceptable and contributed to wasted resources: both of the parties and of the Court.
5. In my view the Respondents’ behaviour does go beyond what is acceptable.  Their insistence on the condition referred to in paragraph
9 of my earlier judgment was clearly unnecessary and unreasonable.  If it had not been insisted on the Respondents’ application
would have been unnecessary.  Some allowance needs to be made for the fact that the Petitioner could, rather than stand on his dignity,
have agreed to it.  In my view an appropriate order is that the Petitioner pays the Respondents 60% of their costs of the application

doing so by the fact that information has been laid.  It is quite clear that the failure to file the required allotment in the present
case arose as a result of inadvertence by the Company, and that the Company behaved responsibly in writing to the Companies Registry
about this.  It is unfortunate that the Company did not simply issue the application at that time which might have been the more
prudent course, but it does not seem to me that the course it did adopt was irresponsible.  Similarly it is unfortunate that the
Companies Registry did not reply to the letter, or identify the fact that the letter was on file before issuing the summons, but
it does not seem to me that this oversight is a matter in respect of which much blame attaches given the administrative nature of
the task involved, and the amount of paper work the staff of the Companies Registry are required to deal with.  In other words the
fact that the application was not made until after the summons was issued is simply the consequence of an unfortunate set of facts.
 I will therefore grant the extension of time sought in the originating summons.  So far as the applicant is concerned, there be
no order as to costs.

The Plaintiff had sought to file various summonses after the making of the interim RAOs on 10 October 2013 including the ones enclosed
in the Plaintiff’s letter dated 15 May 2015.  I refuse to grant such leave as there is no merit in such applications.  I had already
refused leave for the Plaintiff to file the summonses referred to in the Plaintiff’s letters dated 27 October, 10, 13 & 18
November 2014 (see: the letter from the court dated 9 February 2015).  In these applications, the Plaintiff sought to file the correct
versions of the Amended Statements of Claim in accordance with the Order dated 19 April 2013.  But as I have mentioned above, it
was simply too late.  As the Plaintiff had repeatedly refused to comply with court orders in the past, no further opportunity should
be given to the Plaintiff.
14.  Costs should follow the event.  The Plaintiff has repeatedly ignored the orders of the court which necessitates the taking out of
the various applications.  As the Plaintiff’s conduct amounts to abuse of process of the court, I order that the costs of the Irregularity
Applications, the Dismissal Applications, the RAO Applications and the Plaintiff’s applications dated 27 August 2013 be paid by
the Plaintiff to the Defendants to be taxed on an indemnity basis.  However, the court has not made a final determination on the
merits of the Plaintiff’s remaining claims and so the costs of the actions should be paid by the Plaintiff on normal party-and-party
basis.  I therefore order that, subject to the costs order above, the costs of the actions be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants

     for the 2nd defendant","22. In the circumstances, I do not find it necessary to deal with the other grounds put forward by the plaintiff in support of her application.
 I can understand from the background of this case and the contents of the affirmations that parties are to some extent emotionally
charged.  Hence, the less I say the better.  I will simply point out that I do not find that the defendants have been guilty of culpable
delay in processing the applications for Letters of Administration although I can see some lack of vigilance. Neither do I find that
there was deliberate concealment of assets of the Deceased by the defendants. I accept the 1st defendant that she knew little about the financial affairs of the Deceased and she relied on her former solicitors to conduct investigation.
I also accept the 2nd defendant’s explanation that he did not mention the said sum of RMB10 million odd in the Schedule of Assets because it purported
to be a schedule of the Deceased’s assets in Hong Kong only.  Neither do I find that the defendants are currently holding hostile
attitude towards the plaintiff to a degree that could cause concern to this Court, at any rate not after the PRC judgment.  I also
find that despite some evidence of disagreement between the defendants in 2012, their current relationship is not such that they
could not cooperate if I were to find that the 2nd defendant is a suitable person that this Court can trust.
23. For the above reasons, I grant the relief prayed for in the originating summons.  I also order that costs of these proceedings be
paid by the 1st and 2nd defendants to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed, on party‑and‑party basis.  As for the plaintiff’s own costs, it will
be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.","Date of Judgment: 29 September 2015(Jason Pow, SC)

of the Board of the Company and (b) the disapproval expressed by the court in respect of the corporate governance exercised over
the Company.  Hence, the Summons was rightly taken out.

that the time frame was agreed by him and that he ought to have applied to the court for an extension of time with proper evidence

had been candid and admitted that KPMG, in their position as inspectors appointed by the Cayman Court, had prepared a report by the
time the matter came on before me confirming that the Company was insolvent and acknowledging that the provisional liquidators were
necessary and withdrawn their opposition to the application in the Cayman Islands. Mr. Maurellet who appeared for the opposing creditors
and contributories acknowledged that his clients had been aware of the report, but told me that they had been advised that they could
not refer to it without the leave of the Cayman Court and, presumably, it was not possible to get that in the limited time available.
Be that as it may, it does not seem to me to matter. As I have already said, in my view the application was not necessary and should
not have been made.
12. So far as the opposing creditors and opposing contributories are concerned, they seek their costs on an indemnity basis from the
Petitioner. I agree that the opposing creditors were justified in attending Court and ensuring that it was made aware of the application
in the Cayman Islands given the obscure way this was dealt with in the supporting affirmation. As they knew the Company was insolvent
it does not seem to me that the opposing contributories had any interest in the matter and their involvement was not necessary. However,
it does not seem that it was necessary for the opposing creditors to file the lengthy affirmation in opposition that was produced
or that there is any reason to order costs on an indemnity basis. I will order that the Petitioner pays 50% of the opposing creditors’
costs of the application on a party and party basis.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2015/1990.html,"Mr William Wong SC and Mr Kerby Lau, instructed by Patrick Mak & Tse, for the petitioner"

HKSAR v. ONUAMA ENYINNAYA NKEMDI [2016] HKCFI 13; HCCC 432/2015 (6 January 2016), ,"7. The defendant has submitted to me a letter written in English.  It is well written and goes into considerable detail about the defendant’s
background and circumstances, how he got involved in this crime and his deep regret and remorse for having committed this offence.
 I accept what he says in his letter and that he is as claimed a person who has lived a hitherto decent life in order to provide
for his family.  I will bear this in mind but as I have explained this provides little or no excuse or indeed compassion for what
he has done. 
8. According to the sentencing guidelines for the quantity of narcotic content involved of 718 g of cocaine, he is in the band of 600
to 1,200 g where guideline starting points for traffickers after trial, subject to any enhancement, is 20 to 23 years’ imprisonment.
 I will adopt the starting point of 20 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.  See R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370; HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKC 197; HKSAR v da Silva [2010] HKCA 355; [2010] 5 HKLRD 576 and HKSAR v Chung Ping Kun [2014] 5 HKLRD L2.  The sentencing guidelines also require an enhancement for the international element of bringing the drugs into Hong Kong and the
starting point will be increased by 1 year to 21 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.  The defendant is entitled to a one-third discount
for his early plea of guilty and accordingly he is sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years and 2 months.","Date of Sentence:  6 January 2016(Kevin Zervos)

As to the costs of this application, the plaintiff asks this Court to bear in mind that in fact the 1st defendant is not really opposing the application if the plaintiff were to apply for default judgment within a short period of time,

is a fact that the 1st defendant does oppose time being extended to before trial of this action, and for the reasons above, I hold in favour of the 1st defendant.  On the issue of counsel’s certificate for this hearing, looking at the counsel’s written submissions, I consider
that it is suitable to have counsel’s assistance in this hearing.  Therefore, I grant the counsel’s certificate for this hearing.
 The costs should follow the event and they are to be assessed summarily under O.62, r.9A RHC at the agreed sum of HK$51,600 to be

W v. P [2016] HKCFI 316; HCCT 55/2015 (19 January 2016), ,"11.  As for the complaint on jurisdiction, I am satisfied, after reviewing the Notice of Arbitration, the Statement of Claim filed in
the Arbitration, and the Award, that the Tribunal was clearly correct in its finding that P’s claims for price adjustments under
Clause 5 of the Agreement, on the basis of the discrepancies in weight, content and specifications by physical composition and size
of the Cargo, are all within the reference to the Arbitration.  Claims that an award is outside the terms of the submission to arbitration
are construed narrowly, to only include those decisions which are clearly unrelated to or not reasonably required for the determination
of the issues that have been submitted to arbitration (Grant Thornton International Limited v JBPB & Co (A Partnership) unreported, HCCT 13/2012, 5 April 2013).  The claim as to the adjustments made on the basis of the discrepancies as to the weight,
content and physical composition by size of the Cargo, and the facts relied upon, are all referred to in the Statement of Claim filed
in the Arbitration, and that is adequate (S Co v B Co [2014] HKCFI 1440; [2014] 6 HKC 421).
12.  In short, there is nothing serious or egregious in any error in the conduct of the Arbitration, no prejudice to W established, and
hence no ground to set aside the Award.  The application is simply an attempt to revisit the merits of the decisions made by the
Tribunal, and should be struck out, with costs on an indemnity basis.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2016/316.html,"Mr Douglas Lam SC and Mr Jonathan Chan, instructed by Reed Smith Richards

RE SINO PACIFIC CORPORATION LTD [2016] HKCFI 392; HCCW 257/2015 (20 January 2016),"Mr Kerby Lau, instructed by S T Cheng & Co, for the respondent","13. On balance it seems to me that it was a misuse of the winding‑up procedure to issue a petition, knowing that at the very least
there was a ground upon which the Company could credibly argue that it had a bona fide defence on substantial grounds.  It seems to me that in those circumstances a more generous costs order than would normally be ordered
is appropriate.  I will therefore order that the costs are paid on an indemnity basis with certificate for counsel.
14. I would end by repeating what I have said in a number of earlier decisions including Re Alpha which I have referred to earlier, namely, that the winding‑up procedure is intended only to be used in straight forward cases,
in which a petitioner can genuinely say at the time a petition is presented that as far as it is aware, there is no credible basis
for a company to refuse to pay the debt claimed.  If a petitioner or its advisors are aware of matters which they appreciate if raised
by a company, would be likely to constitute a bona fide defence on substantial grounds, a petition should not be issued.  This would not leave the creditor without recourse.  The correct
course would be to issue a writ for recovery of the debt and if a judgment is obtained and unpaid, at that stage a winding‑up petition
could be issued.  The winding‑up procedure does not exist as an alternative to a writ action.  It exists as a statutory procedure
which enables a creditor to put into liquidation a company which there is reason to believe is insolvent, and its insolvency is the
reason why it has failed to pay a particular creditor a particular debt.","Date of Decision: 20 January 2016(Jonathan Harris)

The final matter I will deal with is the joinder of Ian.  It is possible for an interested party, for example a shareholder, to apply
to be joined as a respondent to an application for leave to commence a derivative action.  Barma J (as he then was) granted such
an application in Re Gen2 Partners Inc [9]and in paragraph 26 of his judgment he cites other decisions in which this had occurred. However, in my view such applications should
only be granted if the applicant can demonstrate that his participation is likely to be necessary to ensure that all relevant matters
are put before the Court.  This might be the case, for example, if due to deadlock in the board the company would not be able to
respond substantively to the application.  An application should not simply be allowed in order that the prospective defendant has
an opportunity to put his side of the story and try and persuade the Court that a serious issue to be tried has not been demonstrated.
 If such applications are allowed the predictable result is what happened in the present case. The Court receives an additional 37-page
written submission descending into more detail and controversy than the criteria by reference to which these are applications are
assessed requires.  This risks making the application needlessly complicated and time consuming.  Fortunately in the present case
the good sense and skill of Mr Chan, and perhaps some, I hope, judicious encouragement by the Court, kept the oral submissions made
on behalf of Ian crisp and relatively short.

As to the costs of these applications, there is no reason why the costs should not follow the events.  The conduct of the defendants
in commissioning the survey without court’s leave and put them in the lists of documents is taken into account and indemnity basis
for the assessment should be imposed.  The plaintiff’s bills for the two actions charging altogether over $200,000 for a hearing
of one hour are obviously excessive on the face of them, even on an indemnity basis.  Taking into consideration the time for the
plaintiff’s solicitors to go through the survey reports, which are in the form of questionnaires, the appropriate costs for the
applications are assessed at $100,000 for both actions; that is to say, $50,000 for each action respectively.

It seems to me that in the circumstances the applicant should only pay one set of costs given that the arguments presented by the
2nd and 3rd putative respondents were practically the same, even though each did make a significant contribution in assisting the court in relation
to the leave application.  The fact is that both parties are on the same side of the fence, basically representing the same interests
and presenting the same arguments.  I will take into account that the 3rd putative respondent was brought into these proceedings at a stage when it would have been clear to the applicant that the Commission
of Inquiry would be addressing the subject of the application.  I will also take into account that the applicant, when he initiated
these proceedings was seeking to address, albeit on an inappropriate basis, a matter of public concern.  As I have said, it should
have dawned on the applicant soon after he initiated these proceedings that there was an alternative remedy to the subject of this
application.
18. Taking all these matters into account, I consider it appropriate that the applicant pay 75% of one set of costs, which I will apportion
by making an order that the applicant pay 25% of the costs of the 2nd putative respondent and 50% of the costs of the 3rd putative respondent.","Date of Decision: 25 January 2016(Kevin Zervos)

For the purposes of sentencing, I will add the narcotic content of the Ice that is contained in the crystalline solid and the methamphetamine
in the 12 tablets.  The combined total is 38.111 g which I will round off to 38.1 g.  The 12 tablets also contained 0.7 g of cannabis
in herbal form which is a very small quantity and therefore I will not factor it in the sentence in light of the quantity of Ice
involved. 
10. According to the sentencing guideline case of AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125 for trafficking in Ice, a starting point for a quantity of 38.1 g of Ice within the indicated tariff band is 8 years and 5 months’
imprisonment.  I will make an allowance for the fact that a significant quantity of the drugs were for the defendant’s own consumption
but when doing so I bear in mind that he was still in possession of the drugs and that according to his admissions in circumstances
where other persons may have had access to them.  I will therefore reduce the starting point to 7 years’ imprisonment which is
reduced by one-third for the defendant’s plea of guilty to 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  Accordingly, the defendant is

	for the 1st and 2nd Defendants (by Original Action)","37.  With respect, that argument is misconceived.  My finding was that the Applicants failed to show likelihood of significant loss.
There is therefore no question that Sun’s undertaking should be fortified for likely damages.  Accordingly, I considered all the
protection the Applicants need is to be protected from the costs of the litigation, treating as if the amount paid into court were
security for costs and for that purpose the amount is sufficient.  The Applicants have put forward no evidence of the level of likely
costs.  It is open to them to make an application for further security for costs insofar as they can justify the same, if their concern
is on their costs exposure.  That concern cannot be a valid ground of appeal.  To succeed in their appeal, the Applicants have to
rely on the other grounds.  
38.  For the above reasons, I am of the view that the Applicants have failed to show that the intended appeal has a reasonable prospect
of success or that there is any other reason in the interests of justice why the appeal should be heard.  Accordingly, their summons
dated 6 November 2015 (as amended) seeking leave to appeal from my decision is dismissed with costs and with certificate for two

The only thing in this case that has caused me to think in relation to the question of costs is the fact that the Court of Appeal’s
decision in Chau Tam Yuet Ching was, in the way that I have analysed the case, conclusive against the applicant.  It could be argued, therefore, that the decisive
authority against the application was a matter to be taken into account in considering the incidents of the costs.  But, on the other
hand, it was a simple step to draw the attention of the court to that authority.  In the circumstances, I do not think that it is
overall a sufficient reason to order costs against the applicant.
38. As to today’s hearing, it was in my view not absolutely necessary but had been held upon the insistence of the applicant. However,
since I specifically informed the respondent that they need not appear, I do not think I should order the applicant to pay the costs

 It would be the creditors who would be penalised and prejudiced by an award of indemnity costs.  Such award is therefore unjust

addressed their minds to the risk of prejudice to the general body of creditors they should have conducted themselves appropriately.
 They should not have used creditor’s funds to pursue such frivolous defences.  Had they proceeded to defend the action by fighting
the issue at the heart of this dispute, as Mr Burns identified it, the trial would have taken less time and there would be no question
of indemnity costs.  In my view, they are the master of the Defendant’s misfortune.  May be they have to account to the general
body of creditors.
34.  The Plaintiff has succeeded in his claim and is entitled to costs of the action.  For the reasons as given above, the construction
issue is the only issue which the Liquidators may reasonably argue.  As for the defence based on the other issues, the Liquidators
have clearly crossed the line of properly defending the action.  Despite Mr Burns’ argument, the sentiments I expressed in paragraphs
142 to 145 of my Judgment have not in any way changed.  The Liquidators’ conduct of the defence constituted an affront to the court’s
sense of justice.  The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to costs on indemnity basis, except for the costs of argument on the construction
issue which only shall be taxed on party and party basis.  That is out of my respect for the Defendant’s right to defend the action.
 Accordingly, I award the Plaintiff’s costs of this action, including the costs of this hearing, against the Defendant to be taxed
on an indemnity basis, except for the costs of argument on the construction issue which shall be taxed on party and party basis.",( Anthony To )Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2016/550.html,"Mr Wong Chao-wai Brian, instructed by Messrs Hastings & Co, for the plaintiff"

letters issued before these proceedings were commenced when making a costs order in respect of the set-offs.  Once proceedings were
started, a sanctioned offer could have been made to Tin.  Even though the terms of Order 62, r.5(1)(d) RHC do not apply to “without
prejudice save as to costs” letters issued before the proceedings were commenced, the absence of a sanctioned offer, after the proceedings were commenced, is a matter I can and do
take into account.  The other matter I take into account in the fact that Trustee’s “without prejudice save as to costs” letters
required Tin to grant releases under deed to the Trustee which might have adversely affected his ability to bring his own claims,
which he later did in these proceedings, including his claims for damages for intimidation, deceit and misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, and breach of contractual and statutory duties.
14.  Although Tin had to come to court in order to get a judgment in his favour in the sum of HK$10,899,727 against the Manager and the

due to Tin was HK$10,899,727, as contended by the Bank, the Manager and the Trustee.  Each of Tin’s challenges to the set-offs

Such plea plainly went to the issue of damages caused by the Words. Payne said such plea was embarrassing as it did not explain how
or why the Words published to the P’s customers (not to the Regulators or to P’s prospective employers) would cause the consequences
alleged. He suggested that (a) above was nonsensical and not understood, and (c) above had nothing to do with the Words. Mr Yip’s
brief but inadequate answer was that paragraph 38 of the ADC could be perfected by amendment to give particulars. But no formulation
of the proposed amendment was placed before me, and it was unclear what particulars could be given to “perfect” the plea. I agree
with Mr Carolan such plea reflected confusion between possible impact of the Words and potential impact of the fact of Summary Dismissal
on D’s prospects of future employment and record as a licensed person with HKMA. In her defamation claim, D might only recover
damages (if successful) for reputational loss caused by the publication of the defamatory Words (pleaded as published to P’s Customers
and not to RBC, HKMA or P’s prospective employers) and not harm to future career prospects caused by the fact of dismissal. I agree
paragraph 38 of the ADC ought to be struck out.

argument is that he is entitled to the difference between the purchase price and the value as at trial based on Johnson v Agnew[6].  The Defendant’s argument is that the Plaintiff is only entitled to the difference between the purchase price and the value as
at the contractual completion date based on the normal rule.  If it were necessary for me to decide that issue, I would consider
this is a special case to which the principle in Johnson v Agnew applies. The parties had an obligation to complete under the ‘must buy must sell’ provision.  The Plaintiff was ready, willing
and able to perform his obligations under the provisional agreement.  If specific performance were not ordered, it would be because
of the exercise of court’s equitable jurisdiction.  The Defendant could not obtain that relief unless she comes to court to invoke
that jurisdiction.  Hence, if the Defendant took three years to obtain this relief, damages should be assessed based on the value
of the Property as at the date when the relief is granted.  She and not the injured party must bear the consequence of her seeking
such relief.  This is what makes the case a special one to which the principle in Johnson v Agnew is applicable. 
55.  For the above reasons, I enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.  I order specific performance of the provisional agreement and
damages for breach of contract to be assessed.  I leave it to the parties to settle the terms of the decree of specific performance.
 For that purpose the parties have liberty to apply.  If the parties are unable to reach agreement within 14 days, the Plaintiff
shall seek directions from court.  The damages shall be assessed at the rate of $6,720 per month from the contractual completion
date until the date of completion of the agreement.  In addition, the Defendant shall pay interest on the damages due from such dates
as they were incurred up to the date hereof at 1% over the prime lending rate of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

applications.
99.  I further make an order nisi that costs of these applications be to the respondents to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two counsel for the Director.
 Further, as the applicants seek to challenge specific decisions made respectively by the HA and the Director, and have for those
purposes, made specific respective allegations against them, I am satisfied that the HA and the Director are justified in having
separate representations and advancing separate submissions on their own.  As a result, each of them should therefore be entitled

P seeks an order that the costs be taxed and paid by D2 forthwith.  D2’s setting aside application is clearly severable and independent
from the main action which concerns P’s claim against D2 for the outstanding price of the bunkers supplied.  That D2’s application
has given rise to a considerable amount of legal costs is clear.  I note that both sides have instructed senior counsel and, as earlier
noted, a further hearing was necessitated.  It is also a fact that had D2’s application been successful it would have the effect
of determining in a summary manner the substantive rights of the parties.

The 2nd defendant in both actions is legally represented at today’s hearing and I am informed that she takes a neutral stance in relation

he had asked for in the second summons. He instead relied on Mr Lai’s report and insisted on a relocation of New Column F for 1.3
m (or 51 inches) and relocation of New Column E and cutting short of the Rebuilt Wall by 0.4 metre (or 16 inches).  He also refused
the defendants’ suggestion of conducting on-site trial tests to find out on the ground how much the right of way has to be widened.
 Such attitude was unreasonable and not conducive to a reasonable dialogue between the parties.  In the end, a full hearing was required
and the resolution of the dispute much delayed adding to the agony of the parties.
78.  Since neither party has behaved reasonably, I consider that the proper course to take is to make no order as to costs.  I therefore
make a costs order nisi that there be no order as to costs.",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2016/1476.html,"Miss Yanky S Y Lam, instructed by George Y C Mok & Co, for the plaintiff"

Again, this turned on the vitality of MUL’s arguments as to “actual fraud”, and for the purpose of the 1295/15 Summons I have
found there was sufficient basis for such argument to survive D2-4’s reliance on the LRO for priority over the 1295/15 TAs. On
MUL’s case, it could have called upon D1 to perfect its equitable estate under the 1295/15 TAs by grant of legal leases by deed,
and it is at least arguable that D1 (with clear knowledge of such matters) in entering into the sham transactions and quickly registering
them with the participation of D2-3 (who were imputed with D1’s knowledge) in order to defeat and extinguish such interests acted
in breach of trust. These are fact-sensitive issues, and I am persuaded they are matters for trial rather than for disposal on point
of law or by striking out.
93.  I therefore dismiss the 1295/15 Summons, 1849/15 Summons and 1850/15 Summons. There is no reason why costs should not follow event.

As I have explained in earlier authorities in particular Re Grand China Shipping (Hong Kong) Company Limited[1], it is necessary for companies to comply with Rule 32 and in my view given the significance of a winding up petition, there will
generally be no credible excuse for a company failing to deal promptly with a petition of which it is aware.  If a company chooses
not to file evidence in opposition before the petition comes on in open court before the Companies Court Judge, the natural consequence
is a winding-up order.  The hearing of a petition before the Companies Judge in open court is an opportunity for the court to determine

I have dealt with this issue briefly in §70 of this Judgment.   Because the Plaintiff has not pleaded any issue relating to the
validity of the MOT after the death of the Father, the witnesses had not been asked to deal with such issue in their oral testimony.
 However, based on the factors referred to in §§61 to 68 of this Judgment, I can only conclude that, despite the MOT had not been
formally transferred to the Plaintiff, he had been occupying the Land under some sort of implied licence after the death of the Father.
 So far as Lot 307 is concerned, the Government had withdrawn the licence in the end of 2011 when it returned the annual renewal
fee to the Plaintiff.  Hence, the Government is entitled to obtain an order for possession of the occupied parts of Lot 307 against
the Plaintiff.  I therefore grant judgment in favour of the 3rd Defendant on the counterclaim for such order of possession.  The counterclaim by the 2nd Defendant is dismissed.

Under Order 38 rule 21, where a party tenders a statement of a person as hearsay evidence without calling him, the court may allow other parties to call
and cross‑examine that person.  None of the respondents had applied to call Mr Chim or Ms Julia Ip for cross‑examination under
that rule.  I do not say that in every case a hearsay statement should be held admissible simply because the other side has not applied
for cross‑examination of the maker of the statement, but it is part of the circumstances that I may take into account.  In fact
I was told by counsel that Mr Chim could not be found by either side and so no subpoena could be served on him.  As regards Ms Julia
Ip there was no direct explanation why she had not been called, though the applicant would raise no objection if she was to be called
by the 2nd respondent for cross‑examination.  Mr Barlow SC said she was in Hong Kong but Ms Chan SC was not in a position to confirm it. 
Ms Chan SC submitted that the evidence of Ms Julia Ip was mainly relevant for establishing the applicant’s case as against the
1st and 3rd respondents, who had not made the same admissions as the 2nd respondent. Although both Mr Chim and Ms Ip had given assistance to the liquidators, that happened in 2004.  The latest contact between
the liquidators and Mr Chim that Mr Barlow SC could point to was in 2008.  The hearsay statements in dispute here had been with the
2nd respondent for a long time, but (with the exception of the interview of Mr Chim) only came into the applicant’s possession two
months before the trial, in August 2016. 
6.  I am mindful that serious allegations are being made against the respondents including allegations of fraud, and that in such cases
the court will be reluctant to act on evidence untested by cross‑examination: see In re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, 308.  But these concerns can in my view adequately be dealt with in the evaluation of the evidence, attributing such weight to the
evidence in question as may be appropriate taking into account all the relevant factors including those set out in s 49 of the Evidence Ordinance.  In all the circumstances I was not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to exclude the evidence altogether at this stage.

I turn proceed to Stage III.  Whilst one may certainly argue that the juridical disadvantages suffered by the Plaintiff are not
particularly serious, the fundamental problem remains, without knowing the nature of the dispute between the parties, the court would
not be able to assess the advantages if the trial is conducted in the Nanjing Court.   The court is therefore not in a position to
conduct the balancing exercise under the Stage III inquiry.  In my judgment, as the 4th and 5th Defendants should be held responsible for failing to put forward the crucial information necessary for the conduct of the balancing
exercise, the court should also find in favour of the Plaintiff in the Stage III inquiry.  Hence, the 4th and 5th Defendants fail in all stages of the inquiry.

Having given the appellant the benefit of the doubt and allowed him to adduce admissible evidence of involuntary intoxication before

when the risk of the combined effect of alcohol and drugs was near its lowest end and was far less likely to have any significant
effect.  He voluntarily and knowingly drank an excessive amount of sake and continued to do so even after he knew he had become inebriated.

SARAS GOPI v. BINA DEEGAN [2017] HKCFI 295; HCA 3075/2015 (19 January 2017),"Mr David Morrison, instructed by Reed Smith Richards Butler, for the defendant","15.  But what is the appropriate order in this case?  Three points need to be made. First, since it is argued on behalf of Mrs Deegan,
and I agree, that there is very little overlap between the claims and the counterclaims, it follows that the sum which Mrs Gopi should
be ordered to provide by way of security should not include the costs of the loan claim, the share claim, the property claim and
the assault claim.  Otherwise, the order would be tantamount to requiring Mrs Gopi to provide security to her daughter for the prosecution
of the counterclaim.  A skeleton bill of costs prepared by Mrs Deegan’s solicitors does not exclude those costs.
16.  Secondly, the skeleton bill of costs (which covers the period up to the date of setting down) includes expenditure on items which
may not be incurred, for example, it includes the costs of applications for specific discovery, for further and better particulars
and for letters of request for the taking of evidence abroad.  Although Mr Morrison for Mrs Deegan assures me that those applications
will be made, you never know with certainty in litigation what is going to happen.  Thirdly, the skeleton bill of costs, is pitched
at a level greater than I think the bill would be taxed at, including, for example, the solicitors’ hourly rates.  It is completely
inappropriate for me to subject the bill to an item by item analysis.  Everyone agrees that nothing but a broad-brush approach is
appropriate.  Applying such an approach, I think that I should order Mrs Gopi to provide her daughter with security for costs in
the sum of $2,000,000.00. Subject to any further submissions on the topic,  I propose to stay all proceedings on the claim until
that security is provided.  I shall hear from the parties how that security should be provided.",Date of Hearing: 19 January 2017Date of Judgment: 19 January 2017,"(Brian Keith)

for the 5th defendant","22.  In the present case the 5th defendant has provided no evidence on which the court could form a view that his signature of these documents represented anything
other than his informed consent to act as guarantor.  His explanation of the circumstances in which he came to sign is bereft of
any relevant detail, and nor is there any detail as to the actual involvement ofhis parents or the background leading up to the execution
of the guarantees.  There is no evidence given as to his personal circumstances upon which the court could form a view as to the
implication of any presumed influence exerted by his parents.  There is, on the other hand, evidence to suggest that the 5th defendant is an adult, actively engaged in business and, at one time at least, a director of the principal debtor, the 1st defendant.  Correspondingly, the weight to be attached to the presumption of undue influence that arises in a parent and child situation,
is low.  The evidential burden on the plaintiff to show that the 5th defendant was properly advised of the risks inherent in the guarantee was easily met by the plaintiff.
23.  In those circumstances the court concluded that the 5th defendant had not discharged the burden which lay upon him of showing triable issues, or other reasons for which this matter should
proceed to a trial.  The 5th defendant’s appeal against the decision of the Master was, accordingly, dismissed.  Costs were awarded to the plaintiff on an indemnity

In arriving at her sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010]5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for section 38AA offences.  Here, the appellant was convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence
of 22 months and 2 weeks is correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain
mitigating factors such as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here, the
appellant did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm either upon conviction or during the appeal.
28.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellant.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and it

to disqualify the appellant for less than 12 months.  I conclude there is no legal error by the magistrate and I can see no reason
myself why the disqualification should not be 12 months as dictated by the Ordinance.  I see no special reason the magistrate should

In arriving at his sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for s38AA offences.  Here, the appellants were
convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence of 22 months and 2 weeks is
correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain mitigating factors such
as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here, the appellants did not present
any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm either upon conviction or during the appeal.
30.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellants.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and it
is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. I also dismiss the appeals against sentence.","ALI, JAMSHAID

Originating Summons, which have been set out in paragraph 1 of this judgment above.
19.  The plaintiff asks for costs.  In practice, since it appears that the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man are the only two beneficiaries
of the Deceased’s estate, the plaintiff wants Chan Wai Man to bear half of the costs of these proceedings.  I note that L Chan
J has already ordered on 20 May 2015 that there be no order as to costs between the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man.  After that, Chan
Wai Man decided not to be appointed as the personal representation of the Deceased’s estate and ceased to take part in these proceedings.
 Notwithstanding that, in order to perfect the plaintiff’s title to the Property, he would have to seek the court’s assistance
in any event.  It appears to me that the costs that he has incurred (apart from those which have been covered by the said order of
L Chan J) are unavoidable.  In the circumstances, as a matter of discretion, I shall make no order as to costs.",Date of Judgment: 30 March 2017(Paul Lam SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/580.html,The defendant was not represented and did not appear

The Respondent argues that the acquittal was technical as the Magistrate found there was no supervision in the operation. In HKSAR v Tsang Wai Ping (2005) 8 HKCFARD825, Bokhary PJ expressed caution about depriving an acquitted defendant of costs on this ground (see Hong Kong Archbold
2017 ed para 6-12). More importantly the Magistrate, as I read his reasons for refusal of costs, did not say that he refused costs
on this basis.
89.  In any case, as a result of my decision to allow the appeal against the conviction of the first summons, I do not think that it
is just to refuse costs on the acquitted summons.  I would therefore also allow the appeal against the no-costs order of the Magistrate.

 In the premises, I am not satisfied that the trial magistrate showed he considered the discrepancies in PW1’s evidence as to timing

or findings.  Furthermore, it appeared to me that documents were in the possession of the defence which on their face did not support
their application, and which had not been disclosed. 
190.  The unnecessary and improper act or omission by or on behalf of the defendant was the bringing of the stay application when it was
clearly devoid of merit, and where documents were in possession of the defendant that did not support his application, and were not
disclosed by him.  I therefore order that the defendant pay the prosecution costs of and in relation to the stay application, to
be taxed if not agreed.  I am satisfied that such a costs order is just and appropriate in all the circumstances.[10]",vKWOK WING,"(Kevin Zervos)

Tenthly, in respect of Item E2, Ps claimed counsel’s fees for conference for 1.5 hours in the sum of $6,750, which translated
to an hourly rate of $4,500. I find such rate reasonable for counsel of 20 years’ experience. As explained in paragraph 16 above,
there was no duplicate between this item and Item C3. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 16-17 above, I allow counsel’s fees

after the Court of Appeal’s determination of the stay application.  If the Court of Appeal orders a stay of execution of the Main
Judgment, then there can be no question of an interim payment.  If the Court of Appeal dismisses the stay, then these proceedings
can continue to be finalized.  I would hope that at that time, there would be clearer views on the range of possible valuations of
the shares; and better, more reliable, evidence of costs which might be recoverable from P[1] (ie evidence from the Majority Shareholders’ solicitors).  In particular, if the Court of Appeal dismiss the stay application,
I assume that the costs of the stay applications would not be recoverable from P.

HKSAR v. WONG YI CHING [2017] HKCFI 1219; HCCC 112/2017 (11 July 2017), ,"8.  I do not understand why the defendant would wish to exclude wholly exculpatory admissions made either at the scene of arrest or
in interview but that is a matter for her.  I can find no logic in the complaint made by the defendant in respect to her answers
in interview.  I cannot see why the police would not want the contact details of Ah Po if there was an Ah Po who had been the person
who provided the defendant with the drugs.  I cannot see why the officer would even know about the existence of Ah Po at this stage
of the investigation prior to any interview or why it would be important to the police to have the defendant meeting with Ah Po that
same morning.  In cases of trafficking, defendants are hardly ever given bail and I do not believe that PW1 would have suggested
it.  Indeed, it does not appear that the defendant complains that he did so explicitly.  The defendant herself accepted that she
knew she was going to be prosecuted but maintained that she thought she would get bail as a result of what he said i.e. it wouldn’t necessarily be the case that she wouldn’t be able to leave, if she refrained from giving information which would clearly be of assistance to both her and the police.
9.  I considered the video recorded interview carefully as the defendant also complained that she was kicked by PW1 at one point because
it appeared she was going to provide information she had been asked to withhold.  Throughout the interview the defendant sat upright
with arms crossed and legs crossed.  She looked defensive and she spoke clearly, confidently and quickly without any real hesitation
despite the transcript reading as if she was hesitant.  The officer did not move at the point the defendant referred to as the kick
whilst I considered that she had simply adjusted her position in the chair very slightly.  I do not accept that she was kicked at
that point.  I do not accept that she changed her story at that point because of a kick.  There were two officers in the room and
two officers who escorted her to the room.  I do not accept that she was momentarily left with only PW1 such that he could remind
her not to mention her ability to contact Ah Po or, out of the blue, to suggest that she had bumped into Ah Po that morning.  Accordingly,
I do not find that any part of the VRI was entered into involuntarily and, if admissible on other grounds, it may be adduced.","andWONG Yi-ching (female) (王怡靜)

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. SUN MIN [2017] HKCFI 1266; [2017] 4 HKLRD 211; HCMP 2236/2015 (17 July 2017),"Mr James Man, instructed by Reed Smith Richards Butler, for the defendant","18.  Mr Yu’s argument is that it is apparent from the inclusion of section 213(8), which allows damages to be claimed by the SFC on
behalf of a counter party to a transaction, that section 213(2)(b) is not concerned with compensating a counter party for any loss
caused to him or her.  Section 213(2)(b) requires the court to make the assumption that the counter party retained the shares and
ignore the sale.  On this assumption it is legitimate to calculate the amount to be paid by way of restitution by looking at what
the position of the counter party would have been if he or she had retained the shares and been in a position to sell them when the
share price rose.
19.  Whilst I understand the argument and accept that given the agreement of the parties the order sought in the present case is one
that can be made, and will accordingly make an order in the terms of the originating summons subject to certain minor changes in
the periods for payment, I must say that I harbour reservations about how section 213(2)(b) operates.  It does seem to me that section
213(2)(b) applied as explained by Mr Yu results in a defendant having to pay a sum that neither represents (a) disgorgement of profit
improperly made by the insider nor (b) restoration of loss suffered by another person trading in the shares as a consequence of the
insider’s conduct.  It seems to fall into a separate category, which I have difficulty in characterising.  As, however, the order
is agreed and I have not had the benefit of full argument before me I think it is best that I go no further.  It may be that this
is an issue, which will come back before the court at some time in the future in circumstances in which it can be more fully considered.",Date of Decision: 30 June 2017Date of Reasons for Decision: 17 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

Cocaine and heroin are equated for sentencing purposes and the tariffs as fixed for heroin in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370 apply to cocaine.  This was confirmed in AG v Pedro Nel Rojas [1994] HKCA 54; [1994] 1 HKC 342.  According to the sentencing guidelines for the quantity of narcotic content involved of 69.65g of cocaine, the defendant is in the
band of 50 to 200 g, where the guideline starting point for traffickers after trial, subject to any enhancement, is 8 to 12 years’
imprisonment.  I will therefore adopt a starting point of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment which I will reduce by one third for
the defendant’s guilty plea to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  As I have mentioned, I am of the view that there are special
circumstances in the defendant’s case, as highlighted by his background and youth, that warrant a further reduction in sentence
in order to serve the desirability of rehabilitation.  I will reduce his sentence to 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment. 
11.  I note that the defendant is currently serving a detention centre order.  In accordance with section 7 of the Detention Centres Ordinance, Cap 239, such an order will lapse if the person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is not suspended.

 DLA for the 2nd Accused","44. The final issue arising from HKSAR ‍v ‍Muhammad Riaz Khan (above) that needs to be  considered in this context is whether a ‍ruling in favour of the  prosecution appears unlikely to encourage
any future breaches of the rights at issue.  In my ‍judgement, the unique circumstances  of this case, where one ‍arm of the
police (the Mong Kok SDS team) was doing  its job in an ‍apparently perfectly appropriate and professional way[24] and unbeknownst to the Mong Kok SDS team another arm of the police (the Narcotics Bureau) was doing an apparently perfectly appropriate
and professional job in terms of the detection of crime but, as I have held, fell down in relation to how it dealt with search warrants
and unintentionally left the Mong Kok SDS team in a position where the obtaining of a search warrant under section 52(1E) was not reasonably practicable, I think that this alone would demonstrate that such ruling of this Court in the present circumstances
would be unlikely to encourage any future breaches of this kind.  I hasten to add in this context that the officers of the Narcotics
Bureau in not applying for a fresh warrant or applying to renew the existing warrant were not acting in any form of bad faith.  They
simply got the law wrong.  Further, I would be extremely surprised if the law enforcement agencies have not reviewed their practices
in the light of the decision in Keen Lloyd & Ors v Commissioner of Customs and Excise & Department of Justice (above) and there are in place practices and procedures to minimise the risk of future breaches of the rights involved in this case
on the basis of a stale warrant.
45.  For these reasons, I order that the product of the searches of both the Hennessy Road and Canal Road West premises is admissible
against the 1st Accused.  While parties to these proceedings should be permitted to see these reasons for my decision without delay, I think it is
inappropriate and potentially not conducive to a fair trial for there to be any publicity which refers to the degree to which the
police (in this context, I refer to the police as a whole) considered the 1st Accused to be a target for their interest in connection with trafficking in dangerous drugs.  Thus, while I will provide the reasons
for my decision to the parties, I direct that the reasons should not otherwise be published until the conclusion of the trial or
further order.","LAM AROON

Yam’s decision not to pursue the application for a Mareva injunction, the proposed injunction was still appropriate.  Mr Wong maintained that it was still appropriate for the proprietary
injunction sought, but said that Mr Yam would be happy to abide by such amendments to the draft order as might be made by the court.
 As I informed Mr Wong, it was not for the court to draft an appropriate form of the injunction for his client.  This ought to be
so, particularly where Mr Yam was fully represented by counsel and solicitor whereas Mr Chin was absent at the hearing.  Mr Wong
did not put forward any revised draft order for the court’s consideration.  In the circumstances, Mr Yam’s application must be
considered on the basis of the draft order as annexed to his ex parte summons.
29.  For the above reasons, I refuse to grant the proprietary injunction sought by Mr Yam against Mr Chin.  The ex parte summons dated 18 October 2017 is therefore dismissed with no order as to costs.","CHIN CHOI MING(錢才明)

 interested party","21.  Finally, the applicant has submitted that she should not bear the putative parties’ costs incurred in preparing the opposing affirmations
as they were initially filed without leave of the court.  I am unable to accept this submission. First, before the applicant withdrew
her application, the parties had in correspondence contested on whether leave should be granted for the filing of those affirmations.
 She therefore was aware of the potentiality that leave might be granted eventually.  Second and in any event, leave was indeed subsequently
granted to the filing of those affirmations before she decided to withdraw the leave application.  In the premises, there are no reasons why the costs of affirmation should not be
treated as part and parcel of the putative parties’ costs of the leave application.
22.  For the above reasons, I order that costs of the leave application (including the costs of the opposing affirmations) be to the
TPB and Yiu Lian, to be taxed if not agreed.  Costs of this application for costs should also form part of the costs of the leave

are bound to fail is in itself an abuse of process.  I do not intend to consider the grounds of the petition.  Even if the Petitioner
has an arguable case, he is bound to fail as he has no locus standi.  I cannot help thinking that his motive for presenting the petition was to put pressure on the 2nd Respondentto settle his contractual claim under the Agreement.  Even if he is a victim of breach of the Agreement, his remedy should
lie in contract against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. Maybe he has other difficulties in bringing an action in contract.  That is not a reason to present a petition for winding
up the companies.

11.  I bear in mind that if the quantity of drugs in the possession count had been added to the quantity of drugs in the trafficking
count, the starting point would have made very little difference to the resultant sentence.  To illustrate this point, on an arithmetic
calculation, the quantity of 12 g would result in a starting point of 85.6 months’ imprisonment, and 12.14 g would result in a
starting point of 85.72 months’ imprisonment.  For this reason, as well as bearing in mind the totality principle, I will order

set out in paragraphs 12 and 13 above and decide how I should exercise my discretion. I take into account the important fact that
the plaintiff was the victim of two incidents of fraud.  Little is known about the defendants, including whether they have any other
creditors.  The plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaration and equitable relief sought, so as to avert any need for itto race
against other creditors.  Fairness justifies it.  I note that declaratory relief was also granted in the absence of the defendants

The defendant may consider it “unfair” that the 2nd sale took place approximately when the share price had fallen dramatically in the interim.  But unless there is evidence to show
the sale was dishonest or in abuse or not made in good faith, fairness and reasonableness do not come into the picture.  There is
no suggestion that each of those sales were not made at market price.  None of those considerations described by the plaintiff could
be said to be inappropriate, improper or irrelevant when making decisions to liquidate in the context of margin accounts.  No prima facie case of abuse or irrationality concerning the exercise of the plaintiff’s discretion can remotely be discerned from the evidence
before the court.
31.  In my view, the submission that the plaintiff was in breach of the duty is nothing more than “moonshine” and the appeal merited
immediate dismissal.  An order was also made that the Mareva injunction be continued until further order.","ZHANG JIE (張杰)

needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence.
13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There
is no merit to this appeal and so the appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

of the Injunction Order was perfectly justified.  I am further satisfied that the order should further be continued until trial or

which is the more appropriate forum, depending on the nature and size of the Plaintiffs’ claim against the Partners.

that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum for the trial of claims made in this action.  An order nisi will be made that the costs

As far as costs of this application are concerned, this court is satisfied that Tang was acting in good faith and had reasonable
grounds for making the application.  Given Tam’s unjustified opposition, there seems no reason why such costs should be paid out
of Man Lung’s assets.  In this court’s view, ordering a company to bear the member’s costs of a proper leave application will
only serve to encourage unjustified opposition by the intended defendant to the proposed derivative action in future.  There shall
be an order nisi that costs of this application be borne by Tam, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.
29.  As to whether the Court should grant an order that the costs of the derivative action be indemnified out of the assets of Man Lung

defer such determination when the outcome of the statutory derivative action is known or when the position is clearer: Re Grand Field Group Holdings Ltd unrep, HCMP 1059/2008, Kwan J (as she then was) at [50].  I agree and will defer the matter to a subsequent occasion.  There will

In so far as Mak Ngun Tai is concerned, in my judgment it is distinguishable.  In a case like the present, the 1st defendant, found to have shared the relevant intention for the Transfer to be set aside, was responsible for the plaintiff’s need
to commence, and to proceed with, the action and, after the withdrawal, whatever was done by the plaintiff to obtain judgment against

proceed to a hearing.  I do not read that judgment as laying down any general rule that a party, having taken a neutral stance, would
not be liable for any costs.  Each case must depend on its own facts and the court must exercise its discretion on costs accordingly.

The discussions above are confined to the limb of the application under section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance.  Given my conclusion expressed above, there is no need for me to consider the other limb of the application under the inherent jurisdiction
of the court.  I will just add this.  That jurisdiction to order disclosure by a third party is well established.  It is both wider
than section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance (in the sense that it is not confined to banker’s records), and at the same time narrower (in the sense that it is a power developed
in aid of proprietary or tracing claims) - see Norwich Pharmacal Company v Customs & Excise Commissioners [1973] UKHL 6;  [1974] AC 133 and Bankers Trust Company v Shapira [1980] 1 WLR 124.  Some specific limits on that jurisdiction have also been developed—see Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim (No 5) [1992] 2 All ER 911, A Co v B Co [2002] HKCFI 1080; [2002] 3 HKLRD 111, and CTO (HK) Ltd v Li Man Chiu  [2002] HKCFI 591; [2002] 2 HKLRD 875.  In the present case, the plaintiff’s claim is a proprietary one involving tracing.  The evidence in my view demonstrates a real
prospect that the information sought may lead to the location or preservation of assets to the claim.  The order sought is specific.
 The balance tips in favour of me exercising my discretion granting the order.  If required, I would also have granted the application

Even I were to admit the Plaintiff’s expert evidence and accept the above propositions as a matter of BVI law, it would not affect
my conclusion on the Third Disclosure Application, because the question that I have to decide is not whether the 5th Defendant is acting within the powers conferred by the BVI Court Order, or its directors have actual or ostensible authority, to
oppose the application, but whether I should exercise my discretion to order RSRB to disclose the information and documents sought
by the Plaintiff.  I would have come to the same conclusion with or without the participation of the 5th Defendant.  I would only add that, as stated by the Court of Appeal, the 5th Defendant is not bound, at least as a matter of Hong Kong law, to adopt a neutral stance in respect of interlocutory applications
that may directly concern or affect its interest (see paragraph 24 above).  I do not consider the 5th Defendant to be acting improperly in resisting the present application by the Plaintiff.

Despite the substantial debt, HL with its banking facilitieswas used as the treasury of the family business. The assets of HL were
used freely for the purpose of HIECL, including funds and trading-in of HL’s Toyota Alphard.  The logistic business was then transferred
to HIECL in 2007 for no consideration, shortly before the split, to insulate that asset from possible execution in a pending litigation.
 This shows that the assets of the two companies are treated as common or mutual assets.  Though the two companies were separate
legal entities, all these indicate that they formed an integral part of the same family business.  If they were truly separate entities,
HIECL could have allowed HL to be wound up in 1998 on failing to pay compensation to the property developer.  From the accounting
treatment of the accounts of these two companies and Chui’s own evidence, I find that until the split, these two companies were
operated as integral parts of one family business.  The debt incurred in 1998 was also the debt of the family business. 
142.  When HL’s debt owing to HIECL is viewed against the above background, I have no difficulties to draw the inference that from the
time it was created in 1998, there was no intention that it shall be repaid as if it were a debt contracted at arms’ length.  All
repayments since the creation ofthe debt were just accounting manipulations or internal asset redistribution for business purposes,
such as bookkeeping or tax avoidance.  In the course of discussion about the split, Joe readily agreed to HIECL waiving the debt.
 His agreement is another confirmation of this common intention.  As for HL’s acknowledgment of the debt in its audited report
for the year ended 31 March 2009, Chung Yee explained that he was bound to make the acknowledgement because the debt could not be
removed save by synchronized act of both companies.  Obviously, HIECL was not prepared to take synchronized action.  Indeed, it even
sought to enforce the debt.  I accept his explanation.  Accordingly, I find that the common intention of HL and HIECL was and has
always been that the debt need not be repaid.  For the above reason, HIECL’s claim is dismissed with costs.","Total:

Unauthorized Directors as such would not cause material damage to the Company.  However, I accept the applicant’s argument that
these documents should be viewed against the scheme as a whole.  They were filed pursuant to an elaborate scheme to extinguish the
shares of the lawful owners and to exclude the Original Directors from management of the Company.  The continuing presence of these
documents might cause intangible damage to the Company.  Investors, lenders and people dealing with the Company might view the propriety
of the conduct of the Company and its directors with suspect and might be weary of their authority as its directors and officers
representing the Company.  People intending to deal with the Company might be deterred bythe sight of these documents and might speculate
if there is anything untowardgoing on in the Company or within its management.  There is a real risk that material damage to the
Company might result by keeping these documents in the Companies Register.  The documents are fraudulent and created with intent
to deceive.  They should never have been registered and kept in the Companies Register and should cease to continue to be kept there.
 On the other hand, I cannot see how SIL, SRML or any other person could arguably have any interest in the continuing appearance
of these inaccurate or forged documents and the inaccurate information contained therein in the Companies Register.  The balance
is in favour of their removal than rectification of the information in the Register.

suggestion for the parties to invoke the Mutual Arrangement mechanism, but later rejected the suggestion and insisted on enforcing
the Section 221 Orders.  I can see nothing wrong with the change of stance.  The express purpose of KPMG’s invoking the Mutual
Arrangement mechanism, as the Liquidators now appreciate, is to circumvent the Section 221 Orders and Lok J’s Extension Order.
 Given the history in this case, particularly that the Liquidators are investigating into potential claims against KPMG and KPMG’s
attitude in obstructing the investigation, it is not unreasonable to surmise that the real purpose of the exercise is to cause or
force service of the protective writs and then filing of statements of claim before the Liquidators are able to present a proper
case and then strike them out altogether.   There are good reasons for the Liquidators to be cautious.

If Mr Chung’s submissions are valid, any arithmetical error however insignificant would negate the effect of a conclusive evidence
clause.  What the Bank sought to do washave Mr Ma review the earlier calculations to verify their accuracy. Theamounts stated in
Mr Ma’s affirmation supersede those given by Brenda Chan earlier. It is not the case of the defendants being able to demonstrate
that there is something seriously wrong with Mr Ma’s calculations. The notion that any correction made by the Bank would have the
effect of negating a conclusive evidence clause is contrary to common sense. I am not prepared to accept that proposition in the
absence of clear authority and none was cited.

be stayed pending the determination of the stay application and leave application, with costs reserved.”  That may be what the

ensure that a case is dealt with as expeditiously as is reasonably practicable”.

is to be attached to a magistrate’s advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses,the appellate judge will not affirm a conviction
if not satisfied that it is safe.  The Magistrate tried the case conscientiously of course, but has offered noexplanation why PC
5018’s evidence that he found P1 on the Appellant can be safely relied upon even though his evidence that the Appellant made a
verbal admission to him cannot be safely relied upon.  Neither of those twopieces of evidence is materially more susceptible to honest
mistake than the other.  In fairness to PC 5018, it should be stressed that neither anything said by the Magistrate nor anything
said by me involves finding that he had not been honest.  But the Magistrate not having felt it safe to rely upon PC 5018’s evidence
that the Appellant had made an oral admission to him, I am not satisfied that the reliance which the Magistrate placed on PC 5018’sevidence
of finding P1 on the Appellant is safe.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the conviction is safe.

WADDINGTON LTD v. CHAN CHUN HOO THOMAS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1113; HCA 3291/2003 (17 May 2018), ,"23.  No prior notice of intention to apply for relief from sanction was given by Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that it was plainly
aware, from Mr Law’s Skeleton Argument dated 10 May 2018, that the 5th Defendant would rely on Order 2, rule 4 to resist the Summons.  Further, it is clear from Order 2, rule 5 that a range of matters
mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) thereof have to be considered before the court may grant relief from sanction under that rule.
 Quite apart from the requirement in rule 5(2) that the application must be supported by evidence, it seems to me to be clear, as
a matter of procedural fairness, that a party intending to apply for relief from sanction must give proper notice of the application
to the other side so that it will have an opportunity, if so advised, to file evidence which may be relevant to the matters mentioned
in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) to resist the application.  This was not done.  I am therefore not prepared to entertain the Plaintiff’s
oral application made at the hearing for relief from sanction under Order 2, rule 5.
24.  There is, I consider, no answer to Mr Law’s submission that the Plaintiff’s application for an extension of time to comply with
paragraph 2 of the March 2018 Order is misconceived.  Accordingly, the Summons is dismissed with costs to the 5th Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.","PROFIT POINT LIMITED

gave leave to appeal, there was an application by Bauer for leave to appeal against that judgment.  That resulted in another hearing
on 16 May 2017 and a Ruling by the learned Deputy Judge dated 26 May 2017.  Dissatisfied with the Ruling, Bauer then sought leave

given on 4 September 2017. 
85.  Speaking for myself, I would have found it quite difficult to determine the application for leave to appeal against Award (1) without
getting into much details and a great deal of assistance by counsel on both sides.  I believe that there is scope for a roll-up hearing
for the leave application, which is sometimes adopted in judicial review proceedings, in an usually difficult case.  The decision
whether to adopt such a procedure is of course that of the judge seized of the matter.  This procedure has the attractions of speed

As to costs, the 1st defendant should be liable for costs of the plaintiff on a solicitors and own client, and thus indemnity, basis pursuant to the legal

As to the injunction sought by Dong and Wang, if the proxies were not rejected by Chong acting in the way he did, on the evidence
the resolutions proposed would clearly have been passed at the 8 May EGM with the result that the then directors of CSI would no

in Dong’s and Wang’s petition to prevent the board of directors (consisting of only two remaining directors at the time of hearing,

Statement. 
12.  Balancing all the foregoing matters, I was only prepared, with some reluctance, to order a temporary stay of enforcement on the
Award for a period of 6 months from 11 July 2018, conditional upon CZ’s provision of security in Hong Kong, by payment into court
of the full amount of the Award, calculated to be RMB 19,818,046, or the provision of a bank guarantee for such sum.  If security
could not be duly provided within 14 days, the application for stay of execution is discharged.  Liberty was given to both parties
to apply to vary, lift or continue the stay, if the status of the Mainland proceedings is rendered more certain after the end of
July 2018 and if the Mainland proceedings can be seen to progress without prejudice to CZ’s interests in the timely enforcement

been much the same, and would be very difficult to disentangle given that the proceedings have been heard together. I make an order

In so far as the application for production of documents againstthe banks is concerned, I have considered the evidence filed before
this Court.  I record that the summons and all documents in support have been served not only on the defendants but on the banks
concerned.  I have considered the submissions made by Mr Yu for the plaintiff.  I have considered the authorities cited in support.
 I have previously, echoing the warning made in previous authorities, observed that the powers which the Court is now being invited
to invoke have to be exercised with great caution.  It is important to maintain banker/customer confidence.  I have on the other
hand in Akbank TAS v Mainford Limited & Ors [2018] HKCFI 363 (unreported, HCA 3264/2016, 22 February 2018) observed that Hong Kong being an international city, the law should
be facilitative but not obstructive when a victim of a cybercrime comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the true culprits.
 It is a balancing exercise which the Court has to undertake.
7.  In the present case, I note that there is a strong prima facie case of cyber fraud.  The scale and nature of the same as alleged are both large and sophisticated.  The defendants were first level
direct recipients of the Funds.  The claims against them are therefore both personal and proprietary in nature.  The documents and
information sought are clearly relevant.  They are specifically defined, both in terms of nature and duration.  They are confined
to D1’s HSB A/C, D2’s SCB A/C and D3’s BOC A/C.  In respect of the use of any documents that may be disclosed, the draft order
expressly specifies that they may not be used against the disclosing banks, thereby avoiding any possible concern and argument over
infringing any party’s privilege against self-incrimination.  The three Banks are neutral to the application.  On the facts of
this case, I am satisfied that an order in terms of the Summons should be made.  I so order.","MINERVA HOLDING LIMITED

In my view, on the uncontested evidence of the case, there was ample evidence for the prosecution to prove the summonses under reg.
38E against R1 and R2 beyond reasonable doubt.  The acquittals of both R1 and R2 must be reversed with convictions entered against
them accordingly.  It follows that the costs orders against the prosecution in respect of these two summonses for the trial and the
review hearing should also be rescinded.  In my judgment, it would be in the interest of justice that the case should be remitted
back to the magistrate for mitigation and sentence.

victim of an email fraud, and that it has suffered loss in the amount of the Sum.  It appears entitled to relief based on its proprietary
interest in the Sum.  I bear in mind the fact that declaratory relief is being sought.  I need to bear in mind the rules of practice
set out above and decide how I should exercise my discretion.  I take into account the fact that fraud is pleaded and deemed established.
 I take further into account the fact that nothing is known about the defendant, including whether it has any other creditors.  The
plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaratory relief sought, so as to avert any need for it to race against other creditors. 
Fairness justifies it.  I note further that the respondent is neutral to the application.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
that the facts of the present case are such that I should exercise my discretion in favour of granting the declaratory relief and
the vesting order sought.
16.  For the above reasons, I grant the Orders in terms of the Summons, as amended by me, together with costs of the action and this

of minds as between D1 and D3, this court’s understanding of his reasoning differs from that of the appellant.  The court’s understanding
of his reasoning is that, although she was substantially implicated, the magistrate was not sure beyond reasonable doubt that she
really understood the system.  In order to find a conspiracy to carry out a substantive offence, the magistrate had to be sure that,
at the moment of the agreement, D3 knew what the substantive offence was and intended to commit that substantive offence.  It was
not a conspiracy to employ a FDH but a conspiracy to submit false documentation to the ID.  Whilst the magistrate did not find that
part was made out beyond reasonable doubt because of her background, he nevertheless believed her to be complicit in an agreement
to employ a FDH.  By contrast, D1 was a business woman and would have known the process and D2 was in the business of seeking employment
visas for FDHs.  Neither were ignorant of the system and on D1’s own admission, she purported to be the employer knowing full well
she was not.

refuge in a foreign territory.  Hong Kong owes those people nothing but has generously extended its hospitality to them.  The bottom

those people could do in return for the protection offered to them by Hong Kong.

Given my findings above, there is no need for me to consider the issue of quantum.  In all cases, the issue of quantum is directly
linked to the nature and extent of breach(es) that the infringing party is found to have committed.  I do not want to consider quantum
on any hypothetical basis.  It is particularly so in the present case where the plaintiff has raised a number of different causes
of action on different bases.  I add only this, that there are a lot of merits in Mr Leung’s submissions to the following effects.
 The evidence given by Mr Wan on the issue of quantum has three major problems: (1) why the plaintiff said the Premises could be
demarcated into 1,000 car‑parking spaces; (2) the monthly rental of each car-parking space, and (3) the failure on its part to
deal with the operating expenses.  I note that the plaintiff has called no expert evidence in those regards.  I see therefore some
merits in Mr Leung’s submission, based on McGregor on Damages, 20thed (2018), paragraph 10-001, that the plaintiff has failed to prove its loss, and that its claim may be dismissed on this basis alone.
 There is however some evidence which suggests that the defendant might have suffered a small loss (in the sum of HK$10,600, being
alleged expenses in engaging contractors for excavation works at the Premises).  The parties also did not address me on the possibility
of nominal damages.  On that basis, and given my earlier conclusions, I decide to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim on its failure
to establish those framed issues on liability.  I make no findings on the issue on quantum before what I have discussed in this paragraph.

125.  For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.  I make a costs order nisi that the defendant shall have the costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed.

13.  I turn to deal with the costs of the application.  The application to amend the summons dated 22 May 2017 does not raise any issue
of complexity as would warrant instructing counsel to pursue or to resist the application.  However, this is an exceptional case.

made, whether it be over a small matter or a major issue, being argued by senior counsel, I am minded to make a costs order nisi that the costs of the summons to amend the summons dated 22 May 2017 be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff with certificate for
