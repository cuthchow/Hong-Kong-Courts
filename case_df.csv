The 1st and 2nd applicants who were the only two shareholders of the company at the material times – indeed its only two directors – have confirmed
that they were fully aware of the financial position of the company.  It seemed to me that in keeping with the approach of the court
in previous cases, this case might properly be regarded as one in which the non-compliance was inadvertent.  The failure was relatively
inconsequential.  The audited financial statements that have since been prepared for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 show that the
company was indeed dormant during those years.  In fact the company could have passed a special resolution of dormancy and delivered
it to the Companies Registrar following which the company would have been exempt from the obligation to comply with the requirements
of, inter alia, s 122: see s 344A of the Ordinance.  I was also satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure future compliance with s 122 of the Companies Ordinance.

I would end by repeating what I have said in a number of earlier decisions including Re Alpha which I have referred to earlier, namely, that the winding‑up procedure is intended only to be used in straight forward cases,
in which a petitioner can genuinely say at the time a petition is presented that as far as it is aware, there is no credible basis
for a company to refuse to pay the debt claimed.  If a petitioner or its advisors are aware of matters which they appreciate if raised
by a company, would be likely to constitute a bona fide defence on substantial grounds, a petition should not be issued.  This would not leave the creditor without recourse.  The correct
course would be to issue a writ for recovery of the debt and if a judgment is obtained and unpaid, at that stage a winding‑up petition
could be issued.  The winding‑up procedure does not exist as an alternative to a writ action.  It exists as a statutory procedure
which enables a creditor to put into liquidation a company which there is reason to believe is insolvent, and its insolvency is the
reason why it has failed to pay a particular creditor a particular debt.","(Jonathan Harris)

committed a breach of trust and so she adopted the starting point of 9 months and reduced it to 6 months because of the appellant’s
plea and also because the appellant surrendered to the police, the learned magistrate further reduced the sentence by one month,
therefore sending the appellant to prison for 5 months. The total value of the jewelry was about HK$40,000.00 and I cannot see any
grounds of appeal in this case, the sentence was an appropriate one in the circumstances, so having considered all that, I consider
that the appeal should be dismissed.",Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,The appellant appeared in person

may not be incurred, for example, it includes the costs of applications for specific discovery, for further and better particulars
and for letters of request for the taking of evidence abroad.  Although Mr Morrison for Mrs Deegan assures me that those applications
will be made, you never know with certainty in litigation what is going to happen.  Thirdly, the skeleton bill of costs, is pitched
at a level greater than I think the bill would be taxed at, including, for example, the solicitors’ hourly rates.  It is completely
inappropriate for me to subject the bill to an item by item analysis.  Everyone agrees that nothing but a broad-brush approach is
appropriate.  Applying such an approach, I think that I should order Mrs Gopi to provide her daughter with security for costs in
the sum of $2,000,000.00. Subject to any further submissions on the topic,  I propose to stay all proceedings on the claim until

On the basis of the position now taken by the parties and for the reasons mentioned above, the issue to be determined pursuant to
section 75 will be dealt with by the empanelled jury.  They will accordingly be required to take an oath or affirmation to determine whether
the defendant is fit to be tried and the charge to them will be that upon hearing the evidence, including the evidence that they
have heard so far, whether the defendant is under a disability so that he is not fit to be tried or not under a disability so that
he is fit to be tried.  Section 75(4)(b) gives the court the discretion to have the issue determined by the empanelled jury.  But in my view, the consequences of doing so
will mean in the circumstances of this case, if the jury decides the defendant is fit to be tried, then the trial on the general
issue will be before a new jury empanelled for that purpose. ",(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,"Mr Martyn Richmond and Mr Kelvin Man, counsel on fiat, for HKSAR"

the factualissues involved, it makes perfect sense that the two actions be consolidated for hearing. It is further my view that disputes
of such nature between family members should be dealt with expeditiously so that hopefully the riftcan be healed as soon as possible.
 In the course of the hearing, I indicated to counsel that should I dismiss the application, I might consider making case management
directions on consolidation and seek the parties’ submissions in that regard. However, on further consideration, given the different
types of consolidation that can be ordered, and to avoid further unnecessary costs, I have decided not to do so at this stage.  I
however urgeparties to come together and agree upon a set of directions on consolidation, so that this action can be disposed of
together with (or immediately after) the Estate Action. ",(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,"Mr Matthew Chong, instructed by Mandy Wan & Co, for the defendant"

value.  I should add that this ruling, which occurs about one third of the way through the prosecution case, and, if the evidence
turns out differently to that which is anticipated, there might be a case which would justify revisiting this objection and my ruling.
 Part of the reason for this is although the material on the mobile phone is not susceptible of changing, part of my reason for concluding
that the impugned evidence is admissible upon the basis that it is relevant and that the prejudicial effect of that evidence is outweighed
by its probative value, that has been done in the context of not only the product of the mobile phone but also the other evidence
in the case.",(Andrew Bruce SC),Deputy High Court Judge,"Mr Richard David Donald, instructed by Ip, Kwan & Co, for the Accused"

As to the question of the costs in this court, while the appellants are successful in the overall result, they have failed in respect
of the grounds involving Questions 1(c), 2 and 3.  It is readily apparent from this court’s judgment that those questions, particularly
Questions 2 and 3, raise discrete and different arguments from those concerning Questions 1(a) and (b).  In my view they have led
to considerable time and costs being incurred which are exclusively attributable to them.  The circumstances are such as to warrant
a reduction of the costs payable to the appellants in accordance with the Elgindata principles.  Taking a broad brush approach, the fair order seems to me to be that the Commissioner should pay the appellants two‑thirds
of their costs in this court.  For the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the submissions on the form of order and costs are to be
treated as part of the costs of the proceedings.",Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,"Written submissions by Mr Dennis Chang SC, instructed by Mayer Brown, for the 1st and 2nd Appellants"

to adjourn the substantive hearing on 31 December 2018.  Irrespective of the timing of the Stay Application, it cannot be denied
that the plaintiff has been prevented from pursuing the OS thatshe took out many months ago through no fault of her own.  In the

 I find that the Defendant on or about 9 November 2012 wrongfully, in breach of his duty as co-trustee holding the Fund for the four
siblings’ benefit and without the consent of the Plaintiffs, caused the Fund (which was then in the total sum of HK$3,352,443.71)
to be transferred into another account.  I order that the Defendant shall pay a sum of HK$838,111 (ie HK$3,352,443.71 x ¼) to each
of P1, P2 and P3. Notwithstanding that the claims are formulated on breach of trust, the Plaintiffs do not ask for compound interest
or interest on a higher basis. I therefore also make an order nisi that interest on the above sum at the commercial rate (ie prime rate + 1%) from 9 November 2012 to the date of this Judgment and
thereafter at judgment rate be paid by the Defendant to each of the Plaintiffs.  Further, I make an order nisi that costs of this action (save and except any previous costs orders made) be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs, to be taxed
on the basis of a certificate for one counsel, if not agreed.

being sought is clearly relevant and may lead to the location or preservation of assets to which she is making a proprietary claim.
 I have said on previous occasions that when considering such applications, the Court is entitled to put in the balance also the
important policy consideration that, Hong Kong being an international city, the law should be facilitative but not obstructive when
a victim of a cybercrime comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the true culprits.  I note further that the Banks do not
