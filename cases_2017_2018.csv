LEE SIU FONG v. WONG WAN LEUNG AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 3; HCA 122/2012 (3 January 2017),"133.  There is an issue about the counterclaim for possession by the Government.  According to Mr Mok, if the court were to find that
the Plaintiff is now occupying Lot 307 with the permission of the Government, then the counterclaim is not needed because the Government
by definition is already in possession of Lot 307. 134.  I have dealt with this issue briefly in §70 of this Judgment.   Because the Plaintiff has not pleaded any issue relating to the
validity of the MOT after the death of the Father, the witnesses had not been asked to deal with such issue in their oral testimony.
 However, based on the factors referred to in §§61 to 68 of this Judgment, I can only conclude that, despite the MOT had not been
formally transferred to the Plaintiff, he had been occupying the Land under some sort of implied licence after the death of the Father.
 So far as Lot 307 is concerned, the Government had withdrawn the licence in the end of 2011 when it returned the annual renewal
fee to the Plaintiff.  Hence, the Government is entitled to obtain an order for possession of the occupied parts of Lot 307 against
the Plaintiff.  I therefore grant judgment in favour of the 3rd Defendant on the counterclaim for such order of possession.  The counterclaim by the 2nd Defendant is dismissed. 135.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of the action be to the Defendants which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this
Judgment.","Dates of Trial: 6-8, 12, 18 January 2016Date of Judgment: 3 January 2017","(David Lok)

It was Mr Lam’s submission that the court’s view from the authorities was that “the fundamental principle of preservation
of the family property belonging to the male line under Chinese law and custom” would override the General Prohibition Rule in

Tak should go to his then only biological nephew, Mr Wong Chiu.  P being the personal representative of the Estate of Mr Wong Chiu

the submissions today and the lengthy privileged note on the draft consent summons placed before me.  I am satisfied that the terms
agreed upon by the parties are appropriate.  They were arrived at with the assistance of lawyers, past and present, of Mr Yau and
the DLA, upon a proper reflection of responsibility or the lack of it, and a true recognition of not wasting legal aid funds. 5.  In the premises, the court approves the settlement and I grant an order in terms of the consent summons as amended by me, which
terms should remain not open to public search. 6.  I only wish to add that in a case of this nature where a legally-aided litigant is asked to show cause as to why he should not bear
personal costs and a settlement is reached which is not a simple all‑or-nothing liability as to costs, it would be useful for the
litigant or the DLA to produce a short memorandum to explain the rationale behind the settlement terms.","Date of Decision: 6 January 2017(Queeny Au-Yeung)

HKSAR v. YIP SAI-KIN [2017] HKCFI 24; HCCC 467/2015 (7 January 2017),"11.  Ms Wong submits on behalf of the defendant that he should be treated as leniently as possible given his relatively young age and
genuine remorse.  She has submitted letters from the defendant’s mother and uncle.  They both described the defendant as a caring
and bright young person who shows a lot of promise, but unfortunately because of his circumstances he had sought to make some easy
money.  The mother explains that the defendant needed money to marry his pregnant girlfriend but who has now left him, having terminated
the pregnancy.  It is clear to me despite the defendant’s denial of being addicted to drugs that he has been tied up in the drug
community and more than likely as a user of drugs who in this instance also sought to trade in them.  The defendant is a tragic figure
and unfortunately one that comes before the courts on a regular basis: a young person who for whatever reason, whether it be a loss
of self respect or a feeling of insecurity, has resorted to the use of or trading in drugs.  The pattern is all too familiar in that
the offences become more frequent and more serious.  12.  As stressed by Ms Wong, the strongest mitigating factor in the defendant’s favour is that he pleaded guilty and sought to cooperate
with the authorities. 13.  The narcotic content of ketamine involved in the present case falls within the band as set out in the tariff case of S of J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1, of 300 to 600 grammes with a corresponding sentence of 9 to 12 years’ imprisonment.  I will adopt a starting point of 10 years’
imprisonment which is slightly less than would otherwise be imposed but I do so because of his relatively young age and potential
to turn a new leaf and live a decent life.  I will discount the starting point by one-third for the defendant’s plea of guilty
to 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment. The defendant is accordingly sentenced to 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Date of Hearing:

RE GW ELECTRONICS CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 98; HCCW 81/2016 (9 January 2017),"4.  The practice of the Companies Court in circumstances of this sort is quite clear.  A strike-out application effectively determines
the substantive issue in the petition.  If the strike-out issue is unsuccessful, a company will normally automatically be wound up,
unless the parties agree or the Court is persuaded that the petition should be adjourned in order to allow the company the opportunity
to settle the petitioner’s, and possibly other creditors’, claim.  If the petition is not going to be adjourned for reasons of
this sort, the company is wound up, and it is not the practice of the Companies Court to grant a stay pending an appeal of either
a decision to dismiss a strike-out application, or if the matter is determined at the trial of the petition, to challenge the Companies
Court’s judgment. 5.  What, in effect, the Company is seeking is the opportunity to file further evidence which would demonstrate that Anthony Chan J’s
decision was wrong.  This I am not prepared to do and would clearly be wrong in principle.  6.  As a final fall-back position, Mr Yip sought an adjournment of one week in order to give his clients the opportunity to consider whether they should pay so much of the debt as is possible.  The Petitioner
is not prepared to agree to an adjournment in order to allow the Company the opportunity to try and settle a claim which has been
outstanding for some considerable period of time, I will therefore make the normal winding-up order.",Date of Hearing: 9 January 2017Date of Decision: 9 January 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

"WENG, CHI CHEONG v. BARCLAYS CAPITAL ASIA LTD [2017] HKCFI 23; HCA 741/2016 (10 January 2017)","15.  Fifthly, as regards Items D1-3, whilst I accept time would be required to prepare skeleton submissions, peruse the Notice of Appeal,
and prepare/peruse correspondence with client, P and court, I find it unnecessary for “P” to be involved. Given the history of
the Master Hearing, I am persuaded such tasks could be attended to by the junior fee-earner JF with supervision by the partner Mr
Thomas. As alluded to above, I consider it reasonable and appropriate for Mr Thomas to appear at the Appeal Hearing with the assistance
of JF (but not 3 professional fee-earners). On party-and-party basis, it was also unnecessary for “P” to be involved in the preparation
for the Appeal Hearing or for JF to spend 3 hours since she was in an assistive role. As for attendance at the appeal hearing itself,
the court notes the Appeal Hearing took place from 9:57am to 10:31am (ie 34 minutes). Costs for attendance of hearing should be assessed
accordingly. 16.  Sixthly, I do not agree the involvement of 3 professional fee-earners meant, as P suggested, party-and-party costs were increased
by 300%. It was plain from D’s statement of costs that each professional fee-earner incurred different time-costs which meant they
did not triplicate every task. I have assessed the items of costs as above albeit on a broad-brush basis. 17.  Upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary and its costs reasonable” on the sensible
standard as explained by the Court of Appeal, the total costs of D on the statement of costs are assessed at $58,000. Lest it be suggested that the scale of reduction by this assessment in respect of costs claimed by D was different/more than the
reduction by Master Leong in respect of D’s claimed costs in the court below (and as upheld by this court), it must be remembered
that the context was wholly different and Master Leong’s assessment concerned not only the costs of the Set Aside Summons (for
which more work was required than for the appeal) as well as costs of the action.","Date of the plaintiff’s Summary of Objections: 15 December 2016Date of Decision on Summary Assessment of

the warnings given by the police constantly through the amplifiers.  The appellant did not tell the police that she was participating
in a peaceful assembly.  After she had known that the police requested her to leave, she completely relaxed herself requiring the
police to remove her.  I do not accept that she had a reasonable excuse. 59. This ground of appeal is not substantiated. 60.   For the reasons set out above, there was nothing unsafe about the conviction and I dismiss the appellant’s appeal against conviction.

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. NEW HARVEST INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 30; HCMP 1361/2005 (11 January 2017),"177.  So’s written closing submissions for NH stated “我在網上閱續過閣下的履歷, 你曾經是位資深大律師, 替中資銀行打過很多官司,
你係一位對銀行運作非常熟識的大律師, 可以堪稱為專家”. I am quite unable to see the relevance of such submissions

herself trading as WF made clear he would not rely on such submissions. 178.  In conclusion, I find DBS was not in breach of contract or in breach of duty of care in not advising So/WF to require a COI for
the Subject LC and/or in releasing payment under the Subject LC. In the circumstances, So’s/WF’s claim in HCA2807/2004 is dismissed.

THE LIQUIDATOR OF WING FAI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. YIP KWONG ROBERT AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 34; HCCW 735/2002 (11 January 2017),"4.  By s 47 of the Evidence Ordinance the court is required, in civil proceedings, not to exclude evidence on the ground that it is hearsay unless it is objected to and
“the court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the exclusion of the evidence is not prejudicial
to the interests of justice��� (s 47(1)(b)).  The 1st and 3rd respondents had not objected to the admission of the evidence. 5.  Under Order 38 rule 21, where a party tenders a statement of a person as hearsay evidence without calling him, the court may allow other parties to call
and cross‑examine that person.  None of the respondents had applied to call Mr Chim or Ms Julia Ip for cross‑examination under
that rule.  I do not say that in every case a hearsay statement should be held admissible simply because the other side has not applied
for cross‑examination of the maker of the statement, but it is part of the circumstances that I may take into account.  In fact
I was told by counsel that Mr Chim could not be found by either side and so no subpoena could be served on him.  As regards Ms Julia
Ip there was no direct explanation why she had not been called, though the applicant would raise no objection if she was to be called
by the 2nd respondent for cross‑examination.  Mr Barlow SC said she was in Hong Kong but Ms Chan SC was not in a position to confirm it. 
Ms Chan SC submitted that the evidence of Ms Julia Ip was mainly relevant for establishing the applicant’s case as against the
1st and 3rd respondents, who had not made the same admissions as the 2nd respondent. Although both Mr Chim and Ms Ip had given assistance to the liquidators, that happened in 2004.  The latest contact between
the liquidators and Mr Chim that Mr Barlow SC could point to was in 2008.  The hearsay statements in dispute here had been with the
2nd respondent for a long time, but (with the exception of the interview of Mr Chim) only came into the applicant’s possession two
months before the trial, in August 2016.  6.  I am mindful that serious allegations are being made against the respondents including allegations of fraud, and that in such cases
the court will be reluctant to act on evidence untested by cross‑examination: see In re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, 308.  But these concerns can in my view adequately be dealt with in the evaluation of the evidence, attributing such weight to the
evidence in question as may be appropriate taking into account all the relevant factors including those set out in s 49 of the Evidence Ordinance.  In all the circumstances I was not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to exclude the evidence altogether at this stage.
 The question of weight of course looms large.",Reasons for Ruling: 11 January 2017(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First Instance High Court,/2017/34.html,"

AA AND ANOTHER v. THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION [2017] HKCFI 57; HCAL 41/2016 (16 January 2017),"50.  The applicants point out that the meetings took place some weeks before the compelled interviews, and subsequent to the public announcement
by the Japanese regulators.  The applicants express incredulity that there would have been no discussion about the transmission of
materials from the SFC to the Japanese regulators, and the expectations concerning the use and disclosure.  The SFC in response has
stated in its affirmation evidence that it had not provided any information or documents obtained from the applicants to the Japanese
regulators during these meetings and are therefore not relevant to any of the issues in the present proceedings because no materials
were disclosed at the meetings which were concerned.  It would be expected that regulators with a common interest in a matter under
investigation in their respective jurisdictions would meet and discuss operational issues and strategies.  There is no reason to
doubt the nature and subject of these meetings as explained by the SFC.  The critical issue is whether there is any relevant information
or material arising from these meetings that address any of the issues in the present proceedings.  The SFC under its duty of candour
has indicated that there is no such information or material which I accept.  51.  I refuse Request 4. 52.  In light of the foregoing, I allow Request 1 and refuse Requests 2, 3 and 4.

HKSAR v. YEUNG HOI SHAN [2017] HKCFI 62; HCMA 202/2016 (16 January 2017),"24.  Nevertheless, given the positive good character of the appellant and the fact that both parties appeared to be in error/some confusion
before the court below, I took the view, in my discretion, that the fairer way forward was to give the appellant the opportunity
to place before this court admissible evidence as to his ingestion of prescription medicine that evening.  He did so. In the form
of Dr Chan and by giving evidence himself.  In the end this did not avail him.  Dr Chan gave evidence as to why and what had been
prescribed to the appellant and that he had explained the effects of alcohol combined with these prescription drugs.  He explained
that he had been concerned about the increasing level of the appellant’s intake of alcohol over the period he had treated him and
that he had advised him frequently of the combined effects of alcohol and drugs and that this could lead to a loss of inhibition.
 His evidence was that the real risk of intoxication, if there was any in the circumstances of this case, came from the 1.5 mg of
Bromazepam rather than the other two drugs which had been prescribed and the effect of the Bromazepam after 20 hours would depend
upon a number of circumstances but would be at the lower end.  In his opinion, the combined effect of Bromazepam with alcohol would
depend upon the time between the consumption of the two, the speed of consumption of alcohol, the amount of alcohol, the amount the
patient had eaten and his general health.  Whilst Dr Chan explained the drugs prescribed and their potential effect upon the appellant,
it became clear that their effect would have been towards the lower end at the time this offending took place in the evening of 5
June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking the medicine.  It was also clear that the appellant had voluntarily and knowingly drank
an excessive amount of sake (ten glasses) in a relatively short space of time and was aware of his inebriation after visiting the
fourth of ten tables, yet he did not stop drinking.  That inebriation brought out the worst in him.  He behaved in a disgraceful
way towards Miss Yeung and the police officers.  He showed some remorse before this court about his behaviour towards the police
officers but absolutely no remorse at all in respect of his behaviour towards the young lady whom he assaulted that evening.  His
attitude in court suggested that his behaviour that night had nothing to do with prescription medicine or alcohol but more to do
with his attitude to young women generally even when sober. 25.  Having given the appellant the benefit of the doubt and allowed him to adduce admissible evidence of involuntary intoxication before
this court, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the dangers of consuming alcohol whilst on prescription
drugs and that the appellant nevertheless went on to do so.  He did so on 5 June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking his medicine,
when the risk of the combined effect of alcohol and drugs was near its lowest end and was far less likely to have any significant
effect.  He voluntarily and knowingly drank an excessive amount of sake and continued to do so even after he knew he had become inebriated.
 He went on to assault Miss Yeung and the police officers who were brought in to prevent further mishap and he is fully responsible
for that behaviour.  Accordingly I dismiss this appeal. 26.  Costs of the appeal be to the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.","Date of Judgment: 16 January 2017(A P Campbell‑Moffat)

SMART TRIKE MNF. PTE. LTD AND ANOTHER v. FUNG KWOK HOI AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 74; HCA 1989/2014 (18 January 2017),"8.  Though I do not grant judgment in favour of the 2nd Plaintiff, I take the view that there is some justification for the joinder of the 2nd Plaintiff.  To me, the extra costs of having the 2nd Plaintiff in the proceedings are quite minimal, but the inclusion of him as a party in the proceedings can save the trouble of dealing
with any unnecessary technical challenges relating to the ownership of the Copyright Works.  The question of ownership of a particular
piece of copyright work may not be a straightforward matter.  If the Defendants were to take issue with the ownership of the Copyright
Works, the Plaintiffs would then have to explain as to why the ownership of copyright relating to a drawing prepared by a particular
employee would finally vest in the 1st Plaintiff.  To avoid any unnecessary challenges, there is some justification for the joinder of the 2nd Plaintiff.  In particular, the costs associated with the joinder should be minimal. 9.   For the above reasons, I am of the view that the fair order for costs vis-à-vis the 2nd Plaintiff and the Defendants is one of no order as to costs of the action including the costs of the summary judgment application.
 I therefore so order. 10.   For the avoidance of doubt, this application only relates to the costs of the claim by the 2nd Plaintiff.  Hence, the costs order nisi relating to the claim vis-à-vis the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendants has already made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of the Judgment.","Date of Written Submissions :23 & 30 August, 6 September 2016Date of Decisions: 18 January 2017","(David Lok)

SARAS GOPI v. BINA DEEGAN [2017] HKCFI 295; HCA 3075/2015 (19 January 2017),"14.  It is said on behalf of Mrs Deegan that Mrs Gopi has a track record of taking such steps as she can to defeat the claims of her
creditors.  I am not in a position to judge that, because it assumes that various adverse findings will be made against Mrs Gopi
at the trial of the action, and I am not prepared to make that assumption.  Having said that, though, there is unfortunately so much
animosity between the parties in this case that Mrs Gopi might be tempted to put such assets which she has beyond the reach of her
daughter.  The fact is that the court should not ignore the practical realities of a dispute of this kind. Moreover, this application
for security for costs is seeking to protect Mrs Deegan against not being able to enforce an order for costs in her favour at the
end of the trial which is still a long time off.  Anything can happen to Mrs Gopi’s assets in that time.  All in all, therefore,
although it may be possible for Mrs Deegan to enforce any order for costs made in her favour, that is no more than a possibility,
and in any event the enforcement of orders made in Hong Kong against overseas assets could well be a costly exercise.  In the circumstances,
I do not think that these considerations should deter me from making an appropriate order for security for costs. 15.  But what is the appropriate order in this case?  Three points need to be made. First, since it is argued on behalf of Mrs Deegan,
and I agree, that there is very little overlap between the claims and the counterclaims, it follows that the sum which Mrs Gopi should
be ordered to provide by way of security should not include the costs of the loan claim, the share claim, the property claim and
the assault claim.  Otherwise, the order would be tantamount to requiring Mrs Gopi to provide security to her daughter for the prosecution
of the counterclaim.  A skeleton bill of costs prepared by Mrs Deegan’s solicitors does not exclude those costs. 16.  Secondly, the skeleton bill of costs (which covers the period up to the date of setting down) includes expenditure on items which
may not be incurred, for example, it includes the costs of applications for specific discovery, for further and better particulars
and for letters of request for the taking of evidence abroad.  Although Mr Morrison for Mrs Deegan assures me that those applications
will be made, you never know with certainty in litigation what is going to happen.  Thirdly, the skeleton bill of costs, is pitched
at a level greater than I think the bill would be taxed at, including, for example, the solicitors’ hourly rates.  It is completely
inappropriate for me to subject the bill to an item by item analysis.  Everyone agrees that nothing but a broad-brush approach is
appropriate.  Applying such an approach, I think that I should order Mrs Gopi to provide her daughter with security for costs in
the sum of $2,000,000.00. Subject to any further submissions on the topic,  I propose to stay all proceedings on the claim until
that security is provided.  I shall hear from the parties how that security should be provided.",Date of Hearing: 19 January 2017Date of Judgment: 19 January 2017,"(Brian Keith)

For the above reasons, at the hearing, I ordered that judgment be entered against the 2nd defendant in respect of the Sum, but refused granting the declaratory relief (as well as the consequential relief of account) in
favour of the plaintiff in respect of its constructive trust claim. 29.  In its application, the plaintiff also asks me to vary the Mareva injunction so as to permit that the plaintiff to withdraw the Sum from the 2nd defendant’s account.  Such application is not an application under Order 19, rule 7.  I have no jurisdiction to grant such application
at the hearing and was not prepared to do so without any proper application supported by proper evidence.  In any event, I doubt
very much whether such variation if necessary.  Even if it turns out to be necessary, the plaintiff can still make an application

SIT ANDREW v. OTS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LTD [2017] HKCFI 89; HCLA 20/2016 (20 January 2017),"14.  The Presiding Officer was well aware of the conflicting evidence concerning Mr Sit’s actual work hours after the agreement to
vary was allegedly reached. I agree with his analysis. Mr Sit was merely given liberty to work lesser hours but if he so wished he
could certainly keep the same hours or even work longer hours. The pay cut was the direct result of the poor start of the business
of the Company. There must be incentive for him to work harder so as to improve the business of the Company. The Presiding Officer
very fairly accepted his allegation that he worked more or less the same hours but this is of marginal relevance to the core factual
issue as to the existence of the agreement to vary only. 15.  For the reasons given above, I cannot accept that Mr Sit is able to show that the Presiding Officer erred in law or that his factual findings were perverse and/or irrational. The authorities
cited by him have no relevance to his application at all. Mr Sit’s application for leave to appeal must fail and I dismiss it accordingly. 16.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision: 20 January 2017(Kent Yee),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/89.html,"

MA WAI CHIU v. NG KIN FAI RICHARD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 317; HCA 61/2017 (20 January 2017),"14.  Mr Chain accepted that the disclosure which Mr Ma had originally sought was “ambitious” and could properly be regarded as “overkill”.
 That concession applies particularly to the requirement to disclose any assets in the defendants’ possession valued at $50,000.00
or more.  Such an order is, on the face of it, no longer necessary in the light of the payment into court which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam
are prepared to make.  But in any event, disclosure of this kind may well be appropriate when an order seeking the freezing of all
of a defendant’s assets up to a certain amount is sought.  The plaintiff will want to know what assets the defendant has in order
to police any freezing order he obtains.  But this is not that sort of case.  There is no freezing order sought in respect of all
the defendants’ assets up to a certain amount.  The freezing order which is sought is limited to the receivables which have been
paid to PSG and YMH.  All in all, the disclosure which Mr Ma is entitled to at this particular stage of the proceedings must be limited
to that disclosure which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam are prepared to give.  15.  That deals with the contentious issues which arise on Mr Ma’s summons, and I am confident that I can leave it to the parties to
draw up an order which reflects the terms of this judgment. 16.  I think that the appropriate order for costs is that the costs of today be reserved to the judge who hears the application on the
return date, with liberty to apply in the event of there not being a return date and the parties not being able to agree the costs
which I have just reserved.",Date of Judgment: 20 January 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/317.html,"

first letter, there is a date on which the letter was faxed to the recipient.  D4 admits that the evidence would have great impact

RE PAUL GIROLAMI [2017] HKCFI 99; [2017] 1 HKLRD 1226; HCMP 3567/2016 (23 January 2017),"19.  In my view, the two relevant matters, so far as the 2nd CFA factor is concerned, remain: first, whether the hearing is a substantial one, secondly (which is related to the first), whether
overseas counsel would be able to make a significant contribution to the hearing by reason of his expertise.   20.  Turning to the facts of the present case, there is no dispute over the specialty and experience of the applicant.  Given that the
hearing is going to be a substantial one – bearing in mind its importance to Mr Chan and the issues and arguments that will be
involved, and having had the benefit of hearing some of these arguments at the hearing as they were presented by Mr Man, I have come
to the conclusion that the applicant, if admitted, would be able to make a significant contribution to the hearing. 21.  This being the case, and having borne in mind all other relevant considerations urged upon the court – particularly the undertaking
given by Mr Chan that if the applicant is admitted to lead the application for leave to appeal before the Appeal Committee, both
Mr Man and Mr Lam will also be instructed, I have come to the conclusion that on balance, the public interest would be better served

SUM MUN KID FREDERICK v. AUTO ITALIA LTD [2017] HKCFI 316; HCA 60/2017 (23 January 2017),"9.  In any event, however the application is framed, the real issue of substance is whether the information sought by Mr Sum needs to
be given now, or whether a decision on what information should be disclosed can await the hearing of the summons.  I know that the
information which is sought goes to the heart of the case, its materiality being beyond question because it is highly relevant to
whether the company has indeed sold the cars, and if it has, whether it has sold them to bona fide purchasers for value without notice of Mr Sum’s rights.  I appreciate that the information would enable Mr Sum’s solicitors to
begin inquiries now about the genuineness of the sales.  But Mr Sum is protected from any disposal of the cars in the future if the
sales which are alleged already to have taken place are found not to have been genuine sales at all by the continuation of the injunctions.
 I have not discerned any downside for Mr Sum if the question of disclosure of the purchasers’ identities is deferred until the
hearing of the summons. 10.  I therefore propose to make an order along the lines of paras 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the order sought by Mr Sum in para 18 of Mr Westbrook’s
speaking note for today, but not along the lines of para 3.  This matches in its entirety the consent order which the company’s
solicitors proposed last week, but which Mr Sum’s solicitors did not agree to because they wanted the court to make the further

FAST FAMOUS CORPORATION LTD v. LEE CHUN PONG BRUCE [2017] HKCFI 106; HCMP 3177/2016 (24 January 2017),"76.  Having disbelieved the evidence of the defendant in so far as it is in conflict with that of the plaintiffs and also held against
Mr Hon’s point about the representation of the $100,000 cheque, I hold that the defendant has failed to establish that the plaintiffs
have waived or are estopped from relying on the defendant’s breach of the conditions of payment in the PSPAs so that they had to

LI LAI YING v. TOP FORTUNE FINANCE LTD [2017] HKCFI 664; HCCW 415/2016 (24 January 2017),"1.  I have before me a summons issued by the Company for a validation order. The Company is a licensed money lender. The Petitioner,
who is not legally represented, has issued a petition for return of HK$200,000 which it would appear from the evidence that has been
filed to date relates to a deposit paid in respect of the sale of landed property. 2.  The Petitioner did not appear today.  She sent a friend Ms To Shuk Yee Suki to represent her.  As I explained to Ms To this she
was not able to do.  However, having asked her a number of questions, it appears unclear whether the Petitioner understands the precise
nature of the application that I am dealing with today. 3.  I am satisfied, having read the evidence and having regard to what I consider to be reasons to think that the petition was not the
right process for the Petitioner to use to try and recover the sums that she believes she is owed, that a validation order should
be granted.  I will make an order in the following terms:","Date of Decision:  24 January 2017(Jonathan Harris)

ZAHIRUL ISLAM v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 111; HCAL 168/2016 (25 January 2017),"29.  The submission before this court focussed on how inadequately the Adjudicator considered the Country of Origin materials.  The applicant
could not point to other aspects of the evidence that he could have challenged if given the opportunity.  I repeat paragraph 27 above.
 Ground 4 is unarguable. 30.  The Adjudicator had considered but did not believe that there was ever any physical attack by any member of the AL.  The Adjudicator
was aware of the threats made by phone but found that the chance of the applicant continuing to receive the death threats to be slim
and no danger of their being implemented.  Again, these were findings of fact and the applicant has not shown in what way the Adjudicator
had failed to take into account relevant evidence or took into account irrelevant evidence.  Ground 5 is unarguable. 31.  In conclusion, none of the grounds advanced are arguable and fail to meet the threshold requirement for granting leave in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Cheung & anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676, at §§14-17.

I agree with Mr Lam that the decision in System Control plc was nothing more than an application of trite Order 14 principles, albeit in the context of statutory and contractual causes of action.
The factual context in that case was far removed from the present case where there was simply an action on contract with no statutory
cause of action. The real question must be whether there was any triable issue or arguable defence, and on the aforesaid analysis
there was none in the present action. 64.  The Appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I grant a costs order nisi that D shall forthwith pay P costs of the Appeal to be summarily assessed. I also give directions for the summary assessment of costs
as follows: 65.  At the Appeal Hearing, I raised with Mr Chu the issue of actual/ potential conflict of interest between D and his present solicitors
LHC, and urged him to consider the matter with D and LHC. D’s stance was set out in paragraph 11 above, ie Yancy and not P was
D’s estate agent for the Transaction. However, LHC were the solicitors who acted for D in relation to the Cancellation Agreement
which reiterated and confirmed the PASP, and which recited P as D’s agent and also the terms of the PASP including clause 10a without
any mention of Yancy at all. This did not sit well with D’s case put forward to this court at the Appeal Hearing. As a matter of
professional conduct, it is essential that LHC should properly address such apparent conflict.","Clause 2

RE THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF PARD TRADE LTD [2017] HKCFI 129; HCMP 3561/2016 (27 January 2017),"6.  The increasing number of applications for recognition and assistance in recent years has allowed a form of order to emerge that
this Court will generally be prepared to grant on written application made pursuant to a letter of request.  Such applications can
be granted very quickly.  I note for the benefit of practitioners that although such applications are very familiar to me, they will
not necessarily be familiar to other judges who hear company matters, and applications should comply with Practice Direction 3.5 and be accompanied by a paginated and indexed hearing bundle to assist the court in processing them quickly.  In the present case
it was not. 7.  I am satisfied having read the supporting affirmations, the Letters of Requests and having regard to the principles explained in
the authorities to which I have referred, that the orders sought by the Liquidators should be granted.  The form of order differs
in one respect from those that have been granted in recent cases.  That is the proposed addition of sub-paragraph (a) referred to
in paragraph 4 above.  I agree that expressly providing a power to this effect would probably assist the Liquidators, but in my view
the proposed wording might be read as giving them a right to obtain from third parties documents that the Liquidators are not entitled
to without an order of the Court pursuant to section 221(3) of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, Cap 32, or some other statutory or common law power.  As the law in Hong Kong currently stands even under section 221(3) a liquidator only has the right to obtain documents “relating to the company”, not documents, which cannot properly and fairly
be described as relating to the company, but concern its promotion and the other matters referred to in section 221(1).

Solicitors for Madam Kay.  The submission was premised upon my granting Madam Kay leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal on the two
Grounds put forward.  I have now refused to grant leave to appeal.  17.

that Madam Kay should be ordered to personally bear the costs of the appeal before me.  18.  Having considered the matter further and in view of the unnecessary arguments raised in solicitors’ correspondence, I think the

The creation of shadow companies of this kind was considered by Zervos J in Power Dekor (Hong Kong) Ltd v Power Dekor Group Co Ltd (HCA 1139/2013). He did not doubt that the use of the documents relating to the incorporation of such shadow companies in Hong Kong
to pass off goods in Mainland China as if they were those of companies in the same position as the plaintiffs amounted to the tort
of passing‑off.  Nor do I.  I am satisfied that each of the defendants has been duly served with the writ with the statement of
claim endorsed on it that each of them has failed to serve a defence (indeed, none of them has filed an acknowledgement of service),
and that each of them has been duly served with the summons seeking judgment in default of defence and has been notified of today’s
hearing.  In the circumstances, I enter judgment for the plaintiffs against each of the defendants, and I make the orders sought
in paras 1 – 8 of each of the summonses. 4.  I have been asked to assess the plaintiffs’ costs summarily.  I am prepared to do that.  I assess the manual work in section B
of the plaintiffs’ statements of costs in the sum claimed of $1,892.  But there will inevitably have been a great deal of duplication
in respect of the work in sections C and D of the statements.  For example, once one set of documents had been prepared, which I
accept may well have taken six hours, it would not have taken anything like that to prepare similar documents for the other six defendants.
 All that needed to be done was to change some of the details.  The same applies to much of the other work which the plaintiffs’
solicitors had to do.  It is not possible for me to say precisely how much work was done for each case, but even taking into account
the time spent on carrying out company searches on each of the defendants, I believe that if I were to assess the plaintiffs’ costs
at one-third of the stated cost of the work in sections C and D of the statements, I would be close to the mark. 5.  Accordingly, I summarily assess the plaintiffs’ costs in each of the cases at $8,884 — in other words, $1,892 for the work set
out in section B of the statements, $1,500 for the work set out in section C of the statements and $5,492 for the work set out in

solicitors had to do.  It is not possible for me to say precisely how much work was done for each case, but even taking into account
the time spent on carrying out company searches on each of the defendants, I believe that if I were to assess the plaintiffs’ costs
at one-third of the stated cost of the work in sections C and D of the statements, I would be close to the mark. 5.  Accordingly, I summarily assess the plaintiffs’ costs in each of the cases at $8,884 — in other words, $1,892 for the work set
out in section B of the statements, $1,500 for the work set out in section C of the statements and $5,492 for the work set out in

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2386; HCCC 41/2016 (7 February 2017),"14.  I have borne in mind the principles of bail.  A court may take into account a range of relevant matters when deciding whether or
not to grant bail.  The presumption of bail can be rebutted by the nature of the offence, the risk of danger to the public, or the
likelihood that the trial could be affected by the defendant absconding or influencing the witness. There is also the factor that
I have mentioned of unreasonable delay.  See HKSAR v Vu Thang Duong [2015] HKCFI 379; [2015] 2 HKLRD 502, at paragraphs 13 to 16. 15.  I have decided, given the seriousness of the allegations against the 3rd defendant and the state of the evidence against him, that there is an unacceptable risk of him not attending a court appointed date
if admitted to bail, even on the suggested stringent conditions.  16.  I therefore for the foregoing reasons refuse the application.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2386.html,"

"
LEE KIN WAI v. LEE KIN CHUEN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 170; HCA 212/2014 (8 February 2017),"43.  At one stage, I was minded to think that different considerations applied to Kin Chuen’s costs.  Kin Chuen never disputed Kin
Wai’s claim to be the sole owner of the Flat.  He did not need to be a party to give his account of the agreement. Kin Wai’s
legal team could have called him to give evidence as a witness. In those circumstances, could it not be said that Kin Chuen was only
made a defendant to U Chan’s counterclaim because he was already a defendant to Kin Wai’s claim?  He would not have been made
a defendant to U Chan’s counterclaim if he was not already a party.  In the circumstances, I was minded to think that U Chan should
not have to bear Kin Chuen’s costs since he was unnecessarily brought into the action by Kin Wai.  However, the better view is
that Kin Wai had to join Kin Chuen as a defendant.  Kin Chuen was one of the legal owners of the Flat, and if a declaration was to
be made to the effect that, despite that, Kin Wai was the sole beneficial owner of the Flat, he had to be a party to the action for
such a declaration to be made.  I therefore make an order nisi that U Chan must pay to Kin Chuen his costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed, though that order may not be enforced without
the leave of the court. 44.  When you apply for a flat under the Scheme, you have to disclose who will be occupying the flat.  In this case, the plan was, as
I have said, for it to be Kin Wai’s home.  Neither Pui Wan nor Kin Chuen were going to be living there.  Yet the Housing Authority
might have been told that either Pui Wan or Kin Chuen would be living in the flat since the application had to be made by them. 
That raises the question whether the Housing Authority might have been misled.  I make no findings about that, of course, since there
would need to be more evidence on the topic, but I asked all counsel whether such a finding might have an impact on the case.  I
had in mind what Litton NPJ said recently[13], that such a circumstance might “have brought into play the principle that a resulting or a constructive trust cannot be enforced
by a contributor if he or she had to rely on such an arrangement to succeed”.  All counsel agreed that it should not affect the
relief I should give. 45.  I mention this only in case the Housing Authority was to allege subsequently that it had been misled.  I am neither encouraging
nor discouraging it to take any action, but should it choose to do so, and if Litton NPJ’s concerns were to apply, it is necessary
for me to state that this judgment only affects the rights of the parties as between themselves and any subsequent purchaser of the
Flat.  The declarations I have made must be subject to any action which the Housing Authority may choose to take.",Date of Handing Down Judgment: 8 February 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/170.html,"

WEALTH GUIDE LTD v.  各佔用人 AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 181; HCMP 1678/2013 (9 February 2017),"55.  The situation could be shown to beyond doubt by the plaintiff’s solicitors asking for specific discovery of the related documents.
 They did not do so either because they were making a gamble that Mr Choi’s solicitors would overlook the documents till the end
or they had overlooked the need to ask for them or they had also overlooked the existence of the documents copies of which had already
been given to them.  56.  In any case, there was no material change in Mr Choi’s case when the two documents were produced at the conclusion of Mr Chan’s
evidence.  They merely corroborate the evidence that was in the witness statements.  The strength of Mr Choi’s case was not made
overwhelming by their disclosure.  I also do not think the plaintiff or its solicitors were surprised by the production of the two
documents.  Therefore, the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the late production of the two documents.  Their disclosure during the
trial was not the cause of the plaintiff’s concession.  Their non-disclosure until after the evidence of Mr Chan did not cause
the plaintiff to incur its costs after Mr Choi’s discovery on 14 February 2015.  The plaintiff only made use of the disclosure
as a convenient opportunity to put an end to its opposition to the counterclaim.  In fact, the plaintiff’s offer dated 1 September
2016 shows that it had decided not to oppose the counterclaim on 1 September 2016 long before the commencement of the trial.  It
withdrew the offer because its apprehension of the effect of my direction issued on 5 September which eventually did not assist it. 57.  In the premises, I make a usual costs order of the action that will follow the event.  I order the plaintiff to pay Mr Choi the
costs of the action which includes the counterclaim.  But I order that there be no order as to costs on the two affirmations made
by Mr Leung Wing Hang and that Mr Choi’s solicitors should not charge Mr Choi the costs for making these two affirmations as they
provide no assistance to the court on the costs issue. ",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/181.html,"

SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE v. JOHNSON CYNTHIA AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 196; HCMP 172/2017 (10 February 2017),"7.  A warrant of arrest for the offence of dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence, contrary
to section 25(1) of the Ordinance was taken out against the 1st respondent on 13 May 2016.  Attempts to serve the warrant and the confiscation proceedings have been unsuccessful. 8.  I am satisfied on the papers that the requirements in relation to absconder proceedings for confiscation of the funds in the bank

THE JOINT AND SEVERAL PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHINA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES INC. v. KPMG (A FIRM) AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1333; HCCW 435/2012 (10 February 2017),"13.  Mr Leung asked me to order a stay of the Order pending determination of an application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal.
 This was opposed by Mr Manzoni who appeared for the Provisional Liquidators principally on the grounds that KPMG are seeking to
stay the Order in order to avoid the MOF’s position becoming clear rather than because unless it is stayed the appeal will be rendered
nugatory. 14.  I am not satisfied that the Order should be stayed.  What I will do of my own motion is to extend the date for production of documents
until 12 noon on 10 March 2017.  That way the Order remains in force.  If the circumstances justify it KPMG can always apply for

HARBOUR FRONT LTD v. MONEY FACTS LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 201; HCCW 116/2015 (14 February 2017),"10.  The Petitioner’s last objection concerns UDL, which it says, correctly, has made an offer to rent the Property and provide a materially
greater deposit than GSL.  This I can deal with very shortly.  As I have mentioned UDL has previously been a tenant of the Property.
 It was the way in which YT Leung dealt with problems that arose with UDL’s occupancy that were amongst the reasons why Kwan J
determined the previous petitions against Harbour Front.  It seems to me perfectly reasonable in the circumstances for the Company
not to wish to let the Property to UDL when there is another party willing to do so. 11.  I will, therefore validate the new lease to GSL. 12.  So far as the second item is concerned, namely, the retainer for Savills.  In principle I am prepared to validate this subject to
the following qualifications.  The retainer is to be limited to advising on the pricing of the Property, the best methods of marketing
it for sale and the preparation of material for marketing the Property.  An agreement should be prepared and submitted for the court’s
approval.  Alternatively the matter can be stood over until the hearing of the Petitioner’s application for the appointment of

HEUNG WING YAN v. HANGWAY HOUSING MANAGEMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 207; HCPI 347/2012 (14 February 2017),"28.  As regards the 1st to 6th Letters and other indications to P to drop her claim against D1, it has to be something more than merely non‑acceptance of offer(s)
before it is appropriate to make an order for indemnity costs. Whilst it is possible that an unreasonable failure to accept an offer
for settlement or an unreasonable resistance to a sensible approach to finding a solution for the proceedings may attract indemnity
case, it has been described as “a rare case indeed” (see paragraph 19 above). Often hindsight might show it was unreasonable
or imprudent not to accept a better offer, but that will not normally be sufficient for an award of indemnity costs. 29.  In my view, the dismissal of P’s claim against D1 would not as a matter of course attract costs on indemnity basis. P’s claim
against D could not be said to have been commenced or prosecuted in such a manner as to constitute to an affront to the court. I
do not accept the circumstances of the present action were so insufficient as to put it outside ordinary hostile litigation, or cause
the court to feel a proper sense of indignation at P’s conduct that arose out of concern over eventual recovery of her entitlement
to compensation for personal injuries. P’s claim against D1 was a far cry from having knowingly put forward a false case from the
start. With hindsight the 1st to 6th Letters as well as the letter dated 19 September 2012 by D2’s solicitors that Mr Lim relied on were sensible offers that ought
to have been seriously considered or even accepted, but P had some basis for her claim against D1, albeit somewhat weak and thin,
and her rejection of such proposals was not so unreasonable as to be in that “rare” category of case that justified an award
of indemnity costs. 30.  In the circumstances, the Summons is dismissed, and the Cost Order Nisi is made absolute. There is no reason why costs should not
follow event. I grant a cost order nisi that D1 should pay P costs of the Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed on party-and-party basis,
and P’s own costs be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations.","24 March 2015

                1. The Sanctioned Offer is intended to have the consequences of Order 22 of the RHC.
                2.  After the expiry of 28 days from the date the Sanctioned Offer is made, [P] may only accept it if (a) the parties
agree on the liability for costs; or (b) the Court grants leave to accept it.

a copy of this letter and all relevant correspondences should the issue of indemnity costs against [P] arise.

in hearing arguments on the Summons, and considering the wide scope of some of the documents sought, and the arguments made on relevance,
necessity and privilege, the fair order of costs would be that the Plaintiffs should pay 70% of the costs of the Summons, including
the costs of the hearing on 12 January and 8 February 2017, with certificate for 2 counsel.  45.  The court expects the parties to act reasonably and sensibly after access is given to the Defendant for inspection of the documents,
such that it will not be necessary to waste further time and costs on interlocutory skirmishes which can be avoided with common sense
and reasonable co-operation. In the event that the parties should have to appear in court to argue any further orders to be made

s.16 of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, Cap 485, and was excluded from the Estate.  Further, the set off exercised by the Bankrupt’s ex-employer in respect of the accrued/vested
benefits against the LSP could not change the nature of that payment.  15.  I believe that there is a reasonable prospect of success in these grounds.  The relevant statutory provisions are complex.  On the
authorities before the court, these issues have not been examined by the court.  Hence, any view taken by the Bankrupt’s ex-employer
or the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority is, with respect, not beyond argument.  I should also mention that the point is

when the matters which were the subject of the petition occurred.  The fact the Company may now have different shareholders and directors
does not detract from the fact that the Company was originally a rightful party to the petition and that the SFC was compelled to
bring the petition because the affairs of the Company were misconducted by some of its previous directors. 117.  I think in the circumstances of this case it would not be right to order that the SFC pay any part of the Company’s costs, particularly
as I do not think the Company’s costs of attendance on the petition hearing alone will be substantial.  However, I should caution
that the SFC should not assume the court will come to the same conclusion in future cases and real thought should be given as to
whether it is necessary for a company to attend on the hearing of the petition when that company has made its position clear in affidavit
evidence both as to the stance it is taking on the petition and in providing to the court all material information. 118.  In summary, I therefore made the following orders:","Net assets

CHU KONG v. UP PROFIT LTD [2017] HKCFI 355; HCMP 305/2016 (22 February 2017),"8.  Mr Wong drew to my attention the decision of Mr Justice Anthony Chan in Green Valley Investment Limited [1] in which the judge took the view that the application had been wrongly opposed.  The judge, however, made an order that: 9.  With respect to the learned Judge, it seems to me that an order in these terms contains an inherent contradiction: if there is justification
for ordering costs on an indemnity basis, it suggests that the costs should be paid by the company, or possibly, the directors regardless
of the outcome of the intended derivative proceedings.  If the company or directors avoid liability for costs in the event that they
successfully defend the action, it suggests that their opposition to the application was not entirely unjustified and calls into
question ordering that they pay costs on an indemnity basis.  10.  This serves to illustrate what in my respectful view is the better approach, which is in cases where it is suggested that the application
has been in some way improperly contested, that costs are reserved until either the derivative action is determined or the matter
is otherwise disposed of.","Date of Decision: 22 February 2017(Jonathan Harris)

I am satisfied therefore that the court should order the petitioner to give security for the 1st respondent’s costs.  The quantum of security is in the court’s discretion.  The aim is not necessarily for perfect security.
 The respondents estimated their costs eventually to be in the sum of HK$2,856,000 including the fees of two counsel for the trial.
 Taking into account all the circumstances including the nature of the issues and evidence to be adduced and the timing of this application,
I think it would be just to order security in the sum of HK$1.15 million. 15.  I will order that the 2nd respondent’s application be dismissed with costs to the petitioner and that the petitioner do pay the costs of the 1st respondent of and relating to the application.  In both cases, it will be costs in any event, to be taxed if not agreed. 16.  I will make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the summons with the period of time changed from 14 days to 28 days.

is no need for directions for defendants to adduce its expert on liability and for further witness statements to be exchanged. 34.  The costs of and occasioned by the plaintiffs’ application be to the defendants.  If no agreement on costs is reached, the defendants

 The jury will be appropriately directed to ensure that they do not view the arrangement in any way adversely to the defendants.

to be visited with the costs of the Next Friend Application, the need for which cannot in any way be attributed to the plaintiff. 20.  On the other hand, while the Next Friend Application was not a matter on which the plaintiff should have had no say and the matters
raised in the B&M Letter were not entirely invalid, I find the plaintiff’s stance of formally not opposing the application
and then turning up with both leading and junior counsel to effectively oppose the application at the hearing to be disingenuous.
 I would have been sufficiently assisted by the B&M Letter. 21.  In the circumstances, I am prepared to order the 1st defendant to pay the plaintiff only the costs of the B&M Letter to be assessed summarily.  The plaintiff should file and serve
a statement of costs within 14 days.  The 1st defendant should file and serve a statement of objections (if any) within 14 days thereafter.  The plaintiff should have 14 days

costs only which has been agreed to by the 2nd Defendant.  The fact that the Plaintiff is not asking for anything more than $800 in this application means that the Plaintiff is
not asking for any costs in relation to the application by summons and the hearing on 16 February 2017.  In these circumstances,
even though I have rejected Mr. Leung’s submissions on the legal requirement of an application for unless order, I think it is
fair if the Plaintiff is awarded with the costs of $800 which is the usual rate for an application of this sort.  After all, the
Plaintiff is the party which has been affected by the 2nd Defendant’s seeking of indulgence.  35.  By reasons of the aforesaid, I order that the 2nd Defendant do have time extension up to 6 March 2017 to file and serve his Defence and Counterclaim. 36.  There should also be an order nisi that the costs of this application be to the Plaintiff summarily assessed at $800 payable by the 2nd Defendant.

manner.  The factual questions are complex, and their resolution would require viva voce evidence to be tested by cross‑examination and with proper discovery given by both parties.  Obviously, the summary procedure of

of 11 years.   33.  As for her contribution to the campaign, which is treated as positive good character for the purpose of sentence, I am of the view
that a further discount of 6 months would be appropriate.  I am aware that the discount by some judges in the High Court is almost comparable in terms of percentage
given to those who rendered assistance to law enforcement authorities.  I am of the view that in the absence of evidence of positive
tangible result (as in the case of this defendant), the discount should not be comparable to actual assistance given to authorities.
 The discount of 6 months would make a total discount of about 36%, a net discount of about 3.03% on top of the ⅓ discount. 34.

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2394; HCCC 41/2016 (28 February 2017),"38.  The suggestion of replacing the references to the defendants in the 5th defendant’s statements with a letter of the alphabet is neither appropriate nor practical.  The prosecution case against the 5th defendant is based on his admissions about his dealings with the other defendants as alleged in the conspiracy count.  It will only
confuse the jury as why the persons are referred to by an alphabetical letter when it is alleged that he and the other defendants
conspired together to make explosives, in the form of smoke bombs.  The prosecution case also relies on surveillance evidence where
it is alleged that they meet and gathered together on the occasions the 5th defendant describes in his statements.  I should add that the 5th defendant’s out of court statements is admissible evidence only against the 5th defendant, and this will be made clear to the jury.  39.  In my view, the issue of the 5th defendant’s admissions in his out of court statements can be fairly and properly dealt with by giving full and proper directions
to the jury. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, I refuse the application and the defendants will face trial together on the five counts as contained
in the indictment. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2394.html,"

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2396; HCCC 41/2016 (28 February 2017),"7.  The importance of particulars for a conspiracy offence is that they provide an outline of the prosecution case by specifying, the
nature of the case that the prosecution seek to prove; the principal overt acts from which the prosecution invite the jury to infer
that there was an agreement as alleged; and that a particular defendant was a party to the agreement. It is fundamental that particulars
addressing the essential element of the conspiracy to be proved need to be clear and precise, whereas the overt acts from which the
jury is invited to infer the existence of an agreement will depend upon the evidence presented during the trial.  However, any change
of the case should not disadvantage or prejudice a defendant in the conduct of his defence so as to deprive him of a fair trial.
  8.  In the present case, the prosecution is to provide the defence particulars specifying, the nature and object of the conspiratorial
agreement, including the nature and quantity of the explosive substance(s) that the prosecution allege was the object of the conspiratorial
agreement; the principal overt acts the prosecution allege that infer the conspiratorial agreement; and the case the prosecution
seek to prove that a particular defendant was a party to the conspiratorial agreement.  9.  The prosecution is also to provide the defence particulars specifying the nature and quantity of the explosive substance(s) the

SKYRUN LIGHT INDUSTRY (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. SWIFT RESOURCES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 332; HCA 1278/2014 (1 March 2017),"59.  Mr Hui also said in his written submissions that there is a real risk that the trial dates will be jeopardised.  Though he said
the action was commenced on 8 July 2014, he acknowledged that this application was issued on 31st August 2016.  60.  He referred to Skyrun’s argument that the new case in the amendments is based on the same documentary evidence which has been
available to the defendants all along.  He, however, argued that Skyrun is seeking to plead a fundamentally different nature for
the 1st USD Agreement and the defendants have been taken by surprise.  He also envisaged that change of Skyrun’s case (which is somewhat
inconsistent with the originally pleaded case) will lead to substantial amendments on pleadings and witness statements by both parties.
 But he did not say what kind of amendment to pleadings or evidence will be introduced by the parties.  I say again that such generalized
and boastful complaints are useless.  There must be particulars and concrete particulars to make the complaints meaningful.  Furthermore,
in the light of my discussion on the merits of the amendments and in particular §§5 to 11 of the defence, this argument has no
merit. 61.  In the premises, I allowed the application.  I also order costs of the application and of and occasioned by the amendments be paid
by Skyrun to the defendants.  But I ordered the defendants to pay the costs of the argument on the application to Skyrun as the defendants
have lost their opposition.","Date of Reasons for Decision: 1 March 2017(Louis Chan)

setting a time limit of a week and giving fair warning of the likely order that would be sought if the proposal were to be rejected.
 The proposed costs order in the event of a withdrawal can only be described as generous from the petitioner’s perspective. 81.  Even assuming that the petitioner had been able to mount some sort of a prima facie case (which is not the present case), balance of convenience considerations would rule out any appointment in circumstances where
the petitioner is a foreign national with no apparent assets within the jurisdiction and who has not offered any undertaking as to
damages (much less fortification). 82.  Hopeless applications are not to be encouraged. They fly in the face of a litigant’s obligations under the CJR.  In the circumstances

- which represented half his turnover - of $10,000-$20,000 a month.  That would have required him to buy and sell quite a number
of phones since the profit he claims to have made was only $100 or so on each phone, and yet there was virtually no sign of any phones
in his flat.  Indeed, when asked, a few weeks ago, what his employment history was for the purpose of preparing his antecedents,
he did not say that he bought and sold mobile phones. 11.  Nor do I believe that the defendant borrowed $30,000 from anyone.  He has not called Man Wang Ping as a witness, who is the friend
who he claims lent him the money, nor has he called his mother as a witness to confirm his understanding that she repaid $25,000
of that loan.  The defendant has produced a bank receipt which shows that $25,000 was paid into Man Wan Ping’s account in August
2014, but that could have related to just about anything.  Indeed, at no stage in the course of his trial was it suggested that the
cash found on him or in the bag represented what was left of a loan of $30,000. Moreover, the defendant acknowledged that no interest
was to be charged on the loan, and that no arrangements had been made for its repayment, save only that it was to be repaid when
the circumstances of his business allowed it.  In my opinion, his account is just too fanciful to be believed. 12.  In the circumstances, the defendant has not satisfied me that any of this cash was not received as a result of a drug trafficking
offence.  Indeed, I am sure that it was.  Section 56(1) confers a discretion on the court in those circumstances to make a forfeiture order, and I can discern no reason why a forfeiture
order should not be made.  Mr Donald did not suggest that, if I were to find the facts to be as the prosecution contended, this was
not a case for the making of a forfeiture order.  I therefore order that the cash be forfeited.",Date of Ruling:  1 March 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/504.html,"

LIU MING v. WOO CEONG HOI AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 810; HCCW 204/2016 (1 March 2017),"2.  The 2nd summons was issued by the 1st and 2nd respondents on 17 November 2016 seeking banking documents in respect of deposits referred to in paragraph 34 of the petition.  The
petitioner objects to discovery of those documents on the grounds that although the matter is raised by the petitioner in the petition,
discovery of the bank records might incriminate the petitioner.  The petitioner has filed an affirmation dealing with this.  3.  In a dialogue with the Court Mr Joshua Choy, who appeared for the petitioner, said that he understood that this position invited
the suggestion that the court should infer that the petitioner’s explanation for depositing money, which should have gone into
the Company’s bank account into his own bank account, was bogus.  The petitioner is apparently subject to police investigations
in respect of the payment.  In the circumstances, I proceed on the basis that the petitioner has demonstrated a real risk of incrimination
and will not order discovery.  4.  There was also a discussion as to how costs should be dealt with.  The petitioner arguing that the petitioner had brought his position
to the attention of the respondents by filing an affirmation and in without prejudice save as to costs correspondence.  Having looked

flexibility to deal with the issue of costs after looking at the result of the taxation proceedings.  Depending on the degree of
the taxing down of the Bills (if any), the arbitrator may take different view as to who should bear the costs of the Arbitration
proceedings.  Second, it may not be right for the Respondent to say that the only outstanding matter in the Arbitration proceedings
is costs.  If the Applicants still refuse to pay the taxed fees after taxation, the Respondent may still have to proceed with the
Arbitration to compel the Applicants to pay the taxed fees.  In my judgment, it would be more prudent for the parties to conclude
the Arbitration after the taxation proceedings.  Third, I understand that the parties will soon fix the dates for the taxation hearing,

Mr Lee seeks summary assessment of his costs and has produced a costs statement in which he claims the following items of costs:- 36.  Mr Lee’s affirmation, of 34 pages long, contains, essentially, a list of the unsuccessful legal proceedings previously instituted
by Madam See. There is also a single exhibit to the affirmation consisting of a bundle, without any index, of 1,017 pages of previous
court documents.  If it is decided to include a number of documents in one exhibit, a proper index of the documents should be prepared.
 I pause to observe that the same bundle of 1,017 pages of documents was reproduced as part of the hearing bundles (in 3 volumes),
also without any index.  As mentioned in the course of the hearing, I consider the preparation of the hearing bundles in this manner
to be entirely unsatisfactory. 37.  In view of the fact, as I understand it to be the case, that Mr Lee was involved in most if not all of the previous legal proceedings
brought by Madam See, I consider the time spent by him in preparing the affirmation to be excessive.  I would allow 16 hours of work
for preparation of the affirmation.  I therefore summarily assess Mr Lee’s costs at HK$88,600 (HK$6,600 + HK$4,000 per hour x 20.5
hours).",Date of Hearing: 1 March 2017Date of Decision: 7 March 2017,"(Anderson Chow)

MAN’S (ASIA) DEVELOPMENT LTD v. FUNG CHI KIN [2017] HKCFI 522; HCA 1279/2013 (7 March 2017),"10.  I do not believe that there is anything of critical importance in the valuation report. 11.  The question of market rent in respect of the land in question only goes to the credibility of the Defendant’s case at most. 
It must be borne in mind that it is common ground that the land had been rented by him for many years before the Plaintiff became
the owner of it, and it is not necessarily the case that the Defendant was paying the market rent at the material times as opposed
to paying a rent which, according to him, had been increased from time to time over his long tenancy.  12.  For these reasons, this application is also declined with costs to the Defendant.","Date of Decision: 7 March 2017(Anthony Chan)

CHEUNG HING v. WAH FUNG FOREST RESOURCES LTD [2017] HKCFI 798; HCMP 9/2017 (8 March 2017),"3.  The dispute between Mr Cheung and Mr Wong in relation to the Company and the Plantation Road property has generated a great deal
of actions and proceedings.  There are already more than one derivative action commenced in the name of the Company.  In considering
this new application for leave to bring another derivative action, the court should be apprised of their status and position as part
of the overall circumstances. 4.  Further, apparently some of the derivative actions commenced in the name of the Company have come to a standstill because Mr Cheung,
as a litigant in person, has not been able to progress them.  It is a question that the court as well as the parties need to consider
whether further proceedings should be brought in the name of the Company unless it is shown that they will be pursued and serve a
purpose.  5.  I will therefore adjourn the Originating Summons sine die with liberty to restore.  That will also allow an opportunity for the technical matters raised by Mr Wong on behalf of the Company
to be dealt with and resolved if the proceedings are to be pursued further.","andWAH FUNG FOREST RESOURCES LIMITED

E-TRADE SECURITIES LLC v. CEDALIAN CARE SERVICES CONSULTANTS LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 392; HCA 2312/2016 (9 March 2017),"11.  In the present case, the 4th defendant made an offer, through counsel, to bring into court the sum of money claimed by the plaintiff.  It appeared to me that
this would significantly ameliorate any prejudice otherwise faced by the plaintiff pending a determination of the merits of its claim
and, in the circumstances, an appropriate order for costs would indeed largely compensate any residual prejudice. 12.  Accordingly, the 4th defendant’s application to set aside the default judgement was allowed, conditional upon the payment in by the 4th defendant of the sum of HK$466,500, plus interest in the sum of HK$10,000. 13.  I record that it was common ground between the parties that although the setting aside application strictly speaking addressed only
paragraph 2 of the order of Lam J dated 2 December 2016, the setting aside, together with the payment in by the 4th defendant carried with it the discharge of the Mareva injunction set out at paragraph 1 of that order.

in the existing proceedings was the only proper course open to Madam Cheung.  I do not think that it was.  The existing proceedings were proceedings in which Madam Cheung’s
right to occupy the Flat could have been litigated, but I do not think that those proceedings had to be the forum in which that issue was to be litigated.  Apart from what I said in para 21 above about there having been no obligation
on her to declare her interest in the Flat earlier than she did, it is not as if the court had already determined whether she had
the right to occupy the Flat.  So there was no chance of inconsistent judgments in different proceedings, nor any question of there
being a multiplicity of proceedings, since Madam Cheung’s only reason for seeking to be joined in the existing proceedings is to
obtain a stay of the enforcement of the judgment in those proceedings.  In the circumstances, I do not see why Madam Cheung should
be prevented from having her right to occupy the Flat decided in the fresh proceedings she has issued. 34.  If Madam Cheung’s right to occupy the Flat is to be litigated in HCA 3104/2015, there has to be a stay of the execution of the
writ of possession in HCMP 1084/2008.  Otherwise any judgment in her favour in HCA 3104/2015 will be worthless.  In order to enable
her to apply for that stay, I grant her application to be joined as a party to HCMP 1084/2008.  I stay the execution of the writ
of possession in those proceedings.  That stay will continue until Madam Cheung’s claim in HCA 3104/2015 has been determined or

WONG MAN HON FREDERICK v. CHINA TIMES SECURITIES LTD [2017] HKCFI 432; HCA 2715/2016 (10 March 2017),"6.  Lastly, it is suggested there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether there is credible evidence that the shares have been
sold as alleged by the plaintiff.  As I pointed out in my judgment, there is in fact no direct evidence before the court as to the
sale of the shares.  The evidence is based upon assumptions that shares registered in the name of Standard Chartered Bank must belong
to certain individuals but these assumptions are unsupported by any corroborating evidence.  Indeed, the only direct evidence before
the court is to the effect the shares are still in the custody of the defendant’s custodian, Beaufort Securities Limited. 7.  Even if, however, there was anything in any of the above three grounds of appeal, the plaintiff is unable to overcome the fatal
obstacle to his case in respect of an injunction, namely that damages are clearly an adequate remedy.  There is simply no evidence
before the court to gainsay that damages would not be an adequate remedy and in such circumstances it is clear from all the authorities
that an injunction will not lie.  In such circumstances, I have no hesitation therefore in dismissing this application for leave
to appeal. 8.  I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of this application on a party and party basis such costs to be assessed
on a gross sum basis. The defendant do file its statement of costs within 7 days, and the plaintiff do file its list of objections

Wong as its witness at trial, I accept the explanation given on behalf of the JV.  Mr Wong’s statement only deals with the disputed
items 6.8-6.14 of Appendix 1, which were not pursued at trial.  Further, as Counsel for the JV pointed out, the drawing of an adverse
inference is only appropriate when the opponent’s assertion and claim is credible.  The issues remaining in dispute at trial are
adequately clear without the need to call Mr Wong, and any adverse inference against the JV by reason of its failure to call Mr Wong
would not have assisted Chan’s case.  As the court rightly observed in Gleneagle Holdings Ltd v Tse Yue Fong & others HCA 2807/2006 12 May 2009, it would be unreasonable to draw an adverse inference against a party to give support to an assertion
which cannot even stand on its own, or is not established. 58.  In the light of the findings I have made on the assessment, parties should submit (within 7 days of the handing down of this judgment)

whether those 27 days should be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the sentence which the Appellant now appeals against. 16.  In all the circumstances, I consider it just to reduce the sentence by those 27 days. Without in any way faulting the Magistrate,
I allow this appeal to reduce the sentence by 27 days.  It appears that even if his sentence were not reduced, the Appellant would
have been released 10 days from today on the 23rd of this month.  If so, the result of this appeal is the Appellant’s immediate release. 17.  I conclude this judgment by expressing my thanks to Mr Daryanani for his very considerable assistance in this appeal and, I would

HKSAR v. PABITA RAUT [2017] HKCFI 434; HCMA 551/2016 (14 March 2017),"18.  The magistrate found on the evidence the appellant was working in the kitchen.  She was washing dishes in a staff-only area and
had on an apron and wellington boots to do the task.  Her personal belongings were stored in the staff-only area.  I am satisfied
from the evidence and papers that the sole and irresistible inference of employment can be drawn and the elements of this offence
can be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. 19.  In arriving at his sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for section 38AA offences.  Here, the appellant was convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence
of 22 months and 2 weeks is correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain
mitigating factors such as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here the appellant
did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm.  20.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellant.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and is
not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.  I also dismiss the appeal against sentence.",Date of Hearing: 8 March 2017Date of Judgment: 14 March 2017,"(Amanda J Woodcock)

repayment or dividend, subject to a deduction from Top Master’s liability of HK$1.1 million.  Insofar as Top Master’s liability
does not exceed HK$1.1 million, then P’s remaining debt to Top Master is an asset of Top Master to be recognised in the valuation

Summons should be in the cause of the intended appeal and this court so orders on a nisi basis. 11.  Regarding the BYD Parties’ Costs Summons, given that leave is given to them to appeal against the substantive Amendment Decision

LIT WING YEE v. TANG CHEUK LUN [2017] HKCFI 444; HCA 850/2016 (16 March 2017),"38.  Mr Chen submitted in this argument that the plaintiff would have a high prospect of success and would even obtain a summary judgment
without a trial. However, I am of the view that in dealing with the defendant’s application, a principled approach should be adopted
and the parties’ prospects of success should not be compared. Otherwise the court has to, prior to the hearing of the case, direct
the parties to adduce all the evidence for the court to consider the strength of the evidence and to determine which parties has
a higher prospect of success or how high that is. It is wrong to do it this way. Accordingly, I would not consider this argument
advanced by Mr Chen. 39.  As I have pointed out above that it is wrong in principle for the defendant to apply for stay of proceedings of the present action,
I now dismiss the appeal. 40.  I make a costs order nisi that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the costs of this appeal, and I will assess the amount of costs summarily. Solicitors
for the plaintiff shall file and serve on the defendant a bill of costs within 14 days from today, and the defendant shall file and

extension of time, and dismiss the application for leave accordingly.  It is unnecessary to deal with the detailed points raised
on extension of time, except to record that I do not accept Mr Pun SC’s submission that any eligible resident who has just turned
18 and applied for PRH may bring the same application for judicial review within time for the “grounds for the application first
arose”[30] when he became 18.  It seems to me that quite different considerations may well apply in such a case because arguably the only relevant
social welfare system that has been applicable to such persons is the Refined QPS.  It is however unnecessary to delve into this
question. 113.  For the reasons above, the 2nd and 3rd Applicants’ applications for extension of time and for leave to apply for judicial review are refused.  114.

that the Commission’s decision not to pay the gratuity was perverse or irrational.  In other words, I do not accept that the Tribunal’s

for trafficking in a dangerous drug (HCCC 22/1998) and other matters and court proceedings concerning him.  It would appear that

HKSAR v. GOLDEN FIELD GLASS WORKS CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 491; HCMA 358/2016 (22 March 2017),"17.  The appellant in this case was therefore convicted only under s 6(1) and 6(2)(a) of the above Ordinance.  In other words, the appellant
was convicted of failing to provide or maintain plant and systems of work that are so far as reasonably practicable safe and without
risks to health.  At the trial, the defence’s submission was that the charge against the appellant under the subsection (2)(a)
does not cover supervision because supervision is covered by another subsection namely, subsection (2)(c), the learned magistrate
found that the subsections (a) to (e) are not mutually exclusive and their supervision is part and parcel of the safe system of work,
which the appellant had failed to provide.  However, in the learned magistrate’s conclusion, in his Statement of Findings at para
46, it would appear that the learned magistrate was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to whether the failure of the appellant
was in not giving “direct and clear instructions to PW2” or that the appellant did not supervise properly the workers on the
site or that the appellant had failed to make any risk assessment on the site.  Further, it would appear from the learned magistrate’s
conclusion, he considered that as any of those scenarios would make the appellant guilty of failing to ensure the safety and health
at work of PW2 he convicted the appellant. 18.  I agree with Mr Hui that it is incumbent on the learned magistrate to be satisfied beyond the reasonable doubt on the actual basis
of guilt of the appellant in a criminal trial and using the words “further or alternatively” leads one to conclude that the learned
magistrate was not sure as to upon what basis he convicted the appellant and therefore there is a material irregularity and it is
not fair to the appellant.  The conviction is therefore unsafe and unsatisfactory. 19.  So in the light of the above conclusion, even if the appellant failed on the other grounds of appeal, this ground of appeal having
succeeded would by itself render any conviction unsafe, therefore, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence set aside.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/491.html,"

of the amendments proposed by the Plaintiffs had in fact been approved in the second hearing, in particular those relating to the
claims for unjust enrichment; and (ii) the Defendant had not made any attempt to resolve or narrow the dispute between the parties
before the second hearing.  Further, the Plaintiffs argue that both hearings have assisted the future conduct of the present Consolidated
Action and the other related proceedings, and so the costs of both hearings should at least be costs in the cause. 21.  I disagree.  The Defendant had specified its concern clearly in the correspondence.  The Plaintiffs finally acknowledged such concern
by agreeing to make further revisions to the drafts in the second hearing.  I also take the view that the reference to the Other
Transactions had all along been the main dispute between the parties, and the other amendments, for example those relating to the
claims for unjust enrichment, were less contentious as compared with the amendments relating to the reference to the Other Transactions.
 I doubt whether we need a separate hearing if the dispute was only related to these less contentious amendments.  Finally, the court
would still have to hold separate CMC to case-manage the progress of the different actions, and so one cannot over-exaggerate the
effect of the amendment applications. 22.  For the above reasons, I order that the costs of the amendment summonses and the costs of and occasioned by the amendments, including
the costs of both hearings, be to the Defendant in any event with certificate for counsel.  I appreciate that the Plaintiffs may
have some genuine difficulty in formulating their claims and so there is no reason for the costs to be taxed and paid forthwith.","K&L GATES (a firm of solicitors)

the defendant’s activities are under supervision and control, and staff monitor his interaction with others which is carefully
calibrated and limited. The defendant also receives appropriate psychiatric and counselling care and his behavior is reviewed on
a regular basis depending on his emotional state. It is anticipated that this will continue for at least the next 6 months. 29.  The incident in this case involved the defendant rushing forward towards another resident and pushing him.  It was a single act
which resulted in the other resident falling backwards and hitting his head on the ground.  Unfortunately, it resulted in his death.
 I am told, and I accept, that the defendant has in the past been a reasonably well behaved and cooperative resident at the hostel,
and this was an isolated incident.  With this in mind, as well as the purpose and powers of a guardian and the system and measures
that are in place at the hostel, I am satisfied that a guardianship order is not necessary.   30.

as varied and supplemented by the 1st Supplemental and 2nd Supplemental, and X, LHK and LG are all closely related.  The liability of X under the Guarantee depends on whether LHK is liable
to the plaintiffs under the BOT and the 2nd Supplemental.  Since I am staying the action against LHK to arbitration, it will be a waste of costs and risking conflicting outcomes

application for the discharge/variation of the disclosure order is refused. 42.  As aforesaid, the issue about the ownership of Rs’ assets should be the subject matter of a trial according to the Masri procedure. However, Rs are still studying and preferably the Masri procedure should take place not during school term.  Moreover, the date for the criminal trial of Mrs Chun, who will be an important
witness for Rs, is not yet known. Therefore, I leave it for the parties to discuss the preferable hearing dates for the Masri procedure.  For avoidance of doubt, whilst I have expressed certain views above in relation to the probabilities or otherwise of
certain matters, those views are necessarily provisional in the sense that they are based solely on affirmation evidence.  The judge
who is going to preside over the Masri procedure will of course be entitled to form his own views on those matters and he will also have the added advantage, which I do
not have, of seeing and hearing to witnesses giving evidence in the witness box. 43.  Given the aforesaid results, I am of the view that Ps are the major winner of this hearing, although Rs are successful in having

was employed at the material time.  In paras 16 to 20 of his statement of findings he sets out the facts he relies on to draw that
necessary inference.  He was referred to the authority HKSAR v Ferosh, FACC 2/2014 by defence counsel and the magistrate went on to correctly distinguish it from the facts of this case he found proved
here. 18.  I too am satisfied on the evidence that the only irresistible inference that can be drawn is that the appellant was taking employment
and it was proved beyond reasonable doubt.  On the totality of the evidence, it must be the only irresistible inference. 19.  The grounds of appeal and submissions heard are without merit.  I have assessed the papers and I agree with the magistrate’s findings.

the court and Manulife from the Bar table, without giving any or any sufficient particulars, that his intended trial counsel had
fallen seriously ill and that he had been unable to find new counsel within the time available.  Such ground, if properly made out
on evidence, would have justified an adjournment.  I stood the matter down for the morning to enable Mr Wong to put in evidence and
for inquiry to be made with the Legal Aid Department as Mr Wong also claimed to have applied for legal aid.  With regard to the latter
matter, it transpired that Mr Wong had only obtained the form for application for legal aid on the preceding Friday. 79.  Mr Wong returned in the afternoon with an affirmation made by the solicitor who formerly handled this case for Mr Wong. Unfortunately,
that deposition did not add materially to what Mr Wong had told the court in the morning, which was not much.  80.  The court does not lightly grant an open adjournment of a trial on the first day.  As I said earlier, the sudden illness of counsel
for a party close to the beginning of the trial and the party’s inability to replace counsel within a short time, if substantiated,
may ground an adjournment.  However, the court must be supplied with adequate particulars and supporting materials to properly assess
whether such ground has been made out or not.  The evidence adduced by Mr Wong fell somewhat short.","TOTAL:

 The press area admittedly enjoys some undeniable advantages, but there will be large video walls and television screens set up in
different parts of the venue showing the live feed of information relating to the progress of counting, voter turnouts and announcement
of election result.  Official press releases on voter turnout and the voting results will be on the website of the Election.  Online
media could also make their own arrangements with the candidates and Election Committee members for interviews. 34.  I appreciate that many online‑only media (and their audience) may desire strongly that such media should enjoy access in order
to cover the Chief Executive Election.  But I cannot see how I can assume the function of making policy and by the mandatory injunction
sought by the Applicant here require the Secretary and the Director to give access to a certain class of such journalists and effectively
to transfer their gate‑keeping function entirely to the Applicant. 35.  Accordingly, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature of the injunction sought, the proper separation of the
courts from executive functions, the lack of a high degree of assurance that the interim injunction sought would be found at trial

imposed financial hardship on the appellant and his family.  I sympathise and I am sure there is a financial hardship that will materialise.
 The appellant stressed that he did not know the vehicle was not insured and he honestly believed it was.  However, I see from the
papers that he admitted that the caller was a stranger, which should have meant he had to be more vigilant, being a professional
driver. 10.  From the papers, I find the magistrate carefully considered whether there was any mitigation that could constitute a special reason
to disqualify the appellant for less than 12 months.  I conclude there is no legal error by the magistrate and I can see no reason
myself why the disqualification should not be 12 months as dictated by the Ordinance.  I see no special reason the magistrate should
have considered applicable to the appellant’s mitigation and sentence. 11.  I therefore find the sentence and disqualification period correct and not manifestly excessive.  I dismiss the appeal against the

"CHOY PUI LAM v. THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF CHAN YIM MEI, DECEASED [2017] HKCFI 580; HCMP 313/2015 (30 March 2017)","17.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that, during the lifetime of the Deceased, she held the Property on constructive trust for herself and
the plaintiff in equal shares as beneficial joint tenants.  I agree that, upon her death, her beneficial interest in the Property
passed automatically to the plaintiff by virtue of the operation of the principle of survivorship.  As held in Tan Cheng Gay v Tan Choo Suan (2015) 18 HKCFAR 430 at 449, §62: 18.  For these reasons, I shall make the declarations sought by the plaintiff in paragraphs 1 to 3 of the prayer for relief in the Amended
Originating Summons, which have been set out in paragraph 1 of this judgment above. 19.  The plaintiff asks for costs.  In practice, since it appears that the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man are the only two beneficiaries
of the Deceased’s estate, the plaintiff wants Chan Wai Man to bear half of the costs of these proceedings.  I note that L Chan
J has already ordered on 20 May 2015 that there be no order as to costs between the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man.  After that, Chan
Wai Man decided not to be appointed as the personal representation of the Deceased’s estate and ceased to take part in these proceedings.
 Notwithstanding that, in order to perfect the plaintiff’s title to the Property, he would have to seek the court’s assistance
in any event.  It appears to me that the costs that he has incurred (apart from those which have been covered by the said order of
L Chan J) are unavoidable.  In the circumstances, as a matter of discretion, I shall make no order as to costs.",Date of Judgment: 30 March 2017(Paul Lam SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/580.html,"

the defence would have been focused only on the first summons.  Even if the second summons, as the Magistrate believed, was part
and partial of the safe system of work, I do not think that it should be a good reason to deprive the Appellant entirely of the costs
for the preparation of defence in the second summons. There must have been some extra costs incurred for the preparation of the defence
in the second summons.  It would be a matter for taxation. 88.  The Respondent argues that the acquittal was technical as the Magistrate found there was no supervision in the operation. In HKSAR v Tsang Wai Ping (2005) 8 HKCFARD825, Bokhary PJ expressed caution about depriving an acquitted defendant of costs on this ground (see Hong Kong Archbold
2017 ed para 6-12). More importantly the Magistrate, as I read his reasons for refusal of costs, did not say that he refused costs
on this basis. 89.  In any case, as a result of my decision to allow the appeal against the conviction of the first summons, I do not think that it
is just to refuse costs on the acquitted summons.  I would therefore also allow the appeal against the no-costs order of the Magistrate.
The Appellant will have costs on Summons F for the trial, to be taxed if not agreed.","andMODERN CONCRETE DRILL CUT CO., LIMITED

and foremost, what the Debtor did at the behest of Law in 2012 / 2013 sheds very little light on whether she was under Law’s undue
influence between 2004 and 2009.  Further, while the re‑financing arrangement whereby the Debtor “transferred” the mortgage
of the property from Citibank to DBS Bank may or may not objectively speaking be manifestly disadvantageous to her, subjectively,
the Debtor herself thought it was quite a good deal.  In Leung 4 at paragraph 33, she said: 28.  For the above reasons, this court rejects the defence of undue influence. 29.  In these circumstances, this court is satisfied that the Bank is entitled to a bankruptcy order against the Debtor and hereby grants

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. NEW HARVEST INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 587; HCMP 1361/2005 (3 April 2017),"14.  As evident from the Judgment, DBS prevailed at the end of the day. DBS also obtained costs orders in HCA2807/2004 and HCMP1361/
2005 in its favour, so it was entitled to proceed with taxation and recovery of such costs. Given the nature of the 2 sets of legal
proceedings, the involvement of counsel and experts as well as the interlocutory procedures and the trial that took place, there
was real likelihood that DBS’ eventual agreed/taxed costs might be a substantial portion of or even more than the amount of the
Surplus Proceeds, especially when such costs were to be taxed on indemnity basis. In such circumstances and given the clear contemplation
that the Surplus Proceeds (derived from the Property that was charged to secure such costs before it was sold) should be used to
secure costs liability to DBS should it succeed at trial (which it eventually did), it is entirely appropriate for the Surplus Proceeds
to remain in court pending agreement between the parties on such costs or pending completion of the taxation procedure, and then
for the eventual agreed/taxed costs to be satisfied by payment out from the Surplus Proceeds to DBS, and for any remaining balance
to be paid to NH. 15.  Since DBS was successful on the Summonses filed pursuant to the Direction, costs in respect of such Summonses should follow event. 16.  I therefore grant an order in terms of paragraphs 1-3 of the Summonses save and except that in paragraph 3 thereof the words “Messrs
A M Mui & Kwan, solicitors for the 2nd defendant in HCMP 1361/2005” should be deleted and replaced by “the 1st defendant in HCMP1361/2005”. The remaining Surplus Proceeds (if any) should be repaid to the mortgagor of the Property and not

 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the judgment and its comprehension.  It does not mean those
other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have also been considered. 45.  The parties agree that costs of this action should follow the event.  There will accordingly be a costs order that the costs of

RE LO KWAI YING LOUISA [2017] HKCFI 606; HCB 3145/2015 (5 April 2017),"48.  Overstating the amount of the debt in a statutory demand or the petition is not fatal to a bankruptcy petition, and the real question
is whether the overstatement is causing any prejudice to the debtor.  In Winterthur Life Insurance v Au Oi Fong[20], Chu J said the following relating to an overstatement of the amount of the debt in a statutory demand: 49.  I agree with Mr Yu that no injustice has been caused to the Debtor by reason of the overstatement.  Firstly, the overstatement is
negligible as compared to the size of the Debt.  Secondly, there is no suggestion whatsoever that, if the correct amount of the Debt
was stated in the Statutory Demand and the Petition, the Debtor would have settled the Debt.  Indeed, that suggestion is inconsistent
with the Debtor’s stance that the MF Payments were her “commissions”.  Hence, the Debtor cannot rely on such ground to oppose the Petition. 50.  For the above reasons, the Debtor has failed to establish a bona fide dispute as to the Debt and I therefore make a usual bankruptcy order with costs against the Debtor.",(David Lok)Judge of the Court of First instance,High Court,/2017/606.html,"

LAM HON KEUNG KEITH v. DALNY ESTATES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 607; HCMP 182/2016 (6 April 2017),"17.  Mr Lau argued that the irregularity principle did not apply in the present case, because there were no meetings at all and the resolutions
were a sham.  Even assuming, as the Plaintiff’s case invites the court to do, that Anthony did no more than produce the resolutions
in his office at a time convenient to himself and that in no sense can there be said to have been a meeting, it does not seem to
me that the irregularity principle is circumvented.  On the assumption that Anthony and Genius Villa were able to convene general
meetings and pass the resolutions then in my view the irregularity does apply. 18.  What has given me pause for thought is a point that arose during my questions to Mr Lau.  It seems to be the Plaintiff’s case
that if he had had notice of the meetings then he could have taken action to enjoin Anthony from causing the resolutions to be passed
pending determination of the dispute about ownership of the shares in the companies registered in Anthony and Genius Villa’s names.
 However, Mr Lau expressly disavowed reliance on any irregularity in service of the notices.  If the notices were served properly,
which Mr Lau’s concession requires me to assume, then the only irregularity was in the way the resolution was passed.  That issue
does not turn on the question of beneficial ownership of the shares and who was entitled to decide how the shares were voted.  If
Anthony had caused meetings, albeit as formalities, to take place in accordance with the articles and the requirements of the Companies Ordinance, it necessarily follows that the Plaintiff’s complaints would fall away.  It, therefore, seems to me that the Plaintiff’s case
is unsustainable and should be struck out. 19.  I order that both originating summonses be struck out and make a costs order nisi that the Plaintiff pays the Defendants’ costs with a certificate for two counsel.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/607.html,"

DENNIS KWOK HON MING v. POON SUI CHEONG ALBERT AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 614; HCMP 1526/2013 (6 April 2017),"30.  I am not satisfied that P will be unable to pay or repay the Majority Shareholders the costs and/or buy-out sum for which he would
be liable if the appeal were successful in setting aside the buy-out order, whether before or after the buy-out is executed. 31.  The Majority Shareholders’ submissions as to serious deleterious effect if there is no stay are based on (1) the wasted costs
of the valuation exercise should the buy-out order be overturned (estimated at about HK$2.5 million) and (2) the wasted time and
effort required for the valuation exercise. Wasted costs, time and effort are clearly to be avoided if possible.  However, the position
here is that if the appeal is not successful then the valuation is necessary, and further delay is to be avoided because (1) it is
clearly better for the valuation exercise to be conducted as close as possible to the date at which the value is to be ascertained
and (2) the problems between the Majority Shareholders and P (which I consider to have been unfairly prejudicial conduct against
P) commenced approximately 20 years ago.  As to the wasted costs, if P wishes to push ahead with the valuation which then turns out
to be wasted in light of a successful appeal, then he bears the risk of the wasted costs; and I am not persuaded he could not pay
those costs as I have addressed above. As to the wasted time and effort, that is a function of litigation — for example, it may
well be that P has to expend wasted time and effort on the appeals (if he is ultimately successful), but that would not be a basis

out of high emotion or fear.  He must have paid great efforts in preparing such chili spray or arranging for such spray to be obtained,
which involved a high degree of planning.  Besides, D1 had a total of 5 bottles of such liquid in his possession, which suggested
that he had the intention of using them continuously.  The risk that some could have fallen in the hands of other people for illegal
use could not be ignored either. 124.   Bringing chili spray to protest and petition locations not only causes the aforesaid concern, it also affects the right of the
public to participate in peaceful protests and petitions.  When the possibility of people bringing offensive weapons to protest and
petition locations becomes a worrying concern, the public who only intend to express their views in a peaceful manner would probably
hold back and give up their right of peaceful protest and petition.  This would affect the public in respect of the exercise of an
important right, the consequences of which cannot be ignored. 125.   All in all, I take the view that the sentence of D1 is severe and perhaps there is room for a slight downward adjustment, but it
cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive.  Accordingly, the appeal against sentence is dismissed and the original sentence of 9
months is affirmed.",(Albert Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/623.html,"

made by that magistrate are unreasonable or illogical or contain inherent improbabilities then the conviction will be unsafe.  The
same applies if that magistrate when dealing with the evidence erred in his reference of material facts or omitted or failed to consider

fact or misunderstand or misquote any material fact.  I, having considered the papers before me, also do not find any reason not
to believe the evidence of the victim, PW1.  I am satisfied the magistrate fairly and properly considered the issues raised by the
appellant and was not plainly wrong in his finding PW1 credible. 25.  I find no basis to interfere with the magistrate’s findings of fact and his assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.  The

I take some comfort for that view from the judgment of Lord Justice Widgery in R v Saville [1980] EWCA Crim 1;  [1981] 1 QB 12 (sitting I might add with Bridge LJ and Woolf J as he then was) when he found that the Crown Court had an inherent jurisdiction to
remedy mistakes in the record and from his reliance upon Rubin J in R v Michael [1976] QB 414, where Rubin J said: 6.  However, these were cases which were civil in nature and the authorities provided to this court have been in respect of the appellate
jurisdiction of the court. None of them stand on all fours with the matter before me but I do feel that on the facts of this case,
the same principles apply.  This was a mathematical error which should not have been made. 7.  That being said, this is an issue of the liberty of the individual.  It is not, as was the case before Widgery LJ, an “unimportant
matter”.  Albeit that it refers to just two months’ imprisonment, it is two months of someone’s life and liberty and to this
defendant it is very important indeed.  The issue is therefore whether I should exercise my discretion and amend the record to show
the true intention of the court, or, in the circumstances of this case, not do so.  The defendant left this court room on 27 March
2017 expecting to serve 6 years and 6 months in prison less any reduction she may earn by reason of her good behaviour.  This is
her first term of imprisonment although she has previously been the subject of Rehabilitation and DATC orders as well as probation.
 She is just 21 years old.  The sentences were ordered to be consecutive after taking into account the issue of totality of sentence.
 They were entirely separate offending.  Be that as it may, she expected a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months.  It was
my error and whilst I do not resile from the sentence I intended she should serve, I do not feel in all the circumstances of this
case where there is just two months’ imprisonment at stake for a woman serving her first sentence of imprisonment after a very
difficult life, that it is appropriate to amend the record to reflect my true intent at that time.",Date of Hearing:　11 April 2017Date of Ruling:　11 April 2017,"(A P Campbell Moffat)

in the evidence before the court to show that the Director is using the power of detention for any purposes other than for removal
of the applicant, or it has become apparent to the Director at any time that it would not be possible to effect the applicant’s
removal within a reasonable time.  The evidence shows that a removal order was issued against the applicant shortly after his discharge
from prison and, subject to the issuance of an emergency travel document by the Pakistani Consulate,the Director is in a position
to remove the applicant at any time thereafter.  There is nothing to suggest that the Director has failed to act with reasonable
diligence or expedition to effect the applicant’s removal.  It is also reasonable of the Director to take the view that the applicant
can be removed within a reasonable period of time.   In all the circumstances, I find that the applicant has been detained for a
period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, and his current detention is compliance with the Hardial Singh principles. 23.  None of the grounds relied upon by the applicant can justify the issue of a writ of habeas corpus in the present case.

THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERS LTD v. ZHAO LIANG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 692; HCA 951/2010 (19 April 2017),"33.  The plaintiff applied for summary judgment after the defendants had filed their defence and counterclaim.  Although the defence
and counterclaim was not well-drafted, it appears to me that this is a case where the plaintiff knew that the defendant relied on
a contention which would entitle him to unconditional leave to defend within the meaning of Order 14, rule 7(1). 34.  In the circumstances, I shall order that the plaintiff’s application be dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed. 35.  Lastly, Mr Tai proposed that I should impose a condition on the defendants to amend their defence and counterclaim by including
a declaration of invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff’s Trade Mark within 28 days.  I decline to do so.  I take the
view that I should leave it to the defendants to decide how they wish to reformulate their case in the light of this decision and
to make an appropriate application to amend their pleading accordingly.","ZHAO LIANG (趙良) and SHEN XIAO XIN (沈曉欣)

to accept his evidence and that he was not given a fair trial.  In my view, it is not necessary to further consider and analyse other
grounds here in detail.  As the magistrate stated in paragraph 34 of his Statement of Findings, 21.  I have found that the magistrate’s approach in dealing with PW1’s evidence was improper as stated above.  For this reason, the
prosecution had failed to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the offence. 22.  For the above reasons, I allow the appellant’s appeal against conviction.  Since the appellant has already completed the community

penis to rub against her.  However, it was not PW1’s evidence that she only felt it after she struggled so I can understand why
this was not a possibility considered by the magistrate in his deliberations.  Whilst it is correct the prosecution has a duty to
prove the assault was intentional and indecent, the 2nd ground fails.  33.  This is a rehearing and I must review the evidence to see if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.
 In the premises, I am not satisfied that the trial magistrate showed he considered the discrepancies in PW1’s evidence as to timing
of the assault.  It is therefore not clear if this was taken into account when making a finding of PW1’s credibility.  The conviction

the stay application involved no dispute of fact and was based on “settled” and “entrenched” law so much so that the plaintiff
should even be deprived of the opportunity to file evidence.  I disallow the engagement of senior counsel as unreasonable and substitute
it with a hypothetical junior in the costs assessment. 22.  The plaintiff’s affirmation in relation to the issue of costs was mostly a regurgitation of the correspondence.  It triggered
a lengthy response from the defendant, also with much reference to the correspondence. The plaintiff has caused costs to escalate
out of proportion to the original procedural step of a stay.  Had the stay application been adjourned for substantive arguments,
the costs (even with senior counsel) should not have exceeded $300,000 on party-and-party basis.  The indemnity costs now sought
for an application that has been withdrawn was totally unreasonable, in my view, and the plaintiff has contributed substantially
to it after the call over in January. 23.  Accordingly, though I award indemnity costs to the defendant, I take into account proportionality as if the solicitors had sensibly
dealt with the matter.  I award a sum of $230,000 to the plaintiff.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/761.html,"

RE KINGSWAY INT’L (HK) CORPORATION LTD [2017] HKCFI 861; HCCW 62/2017 (8 May 2017),"5.  As is clear from the fact that the Bank has rejected the request to agree to an adjournment of the petitions, the Bank takes the
view that it is in its own commercial interests that the Companies are wound up and liquidators are appointed in order to take action
which would result in recoveries of sums which will improve its prospects of recovering the underlying loans that it has made and
which are guaranteed by the two Companies. 6.  In my view, and it seems to me that this is generally the position, where a petitioner is entitled to a winding-up order ex debito justitiae, it is for the petitioner in the absence of sensible opposition from other creditors to make what is essentially the commercial decision
as to whether or not an immediate winding‑up order should be made or a petition adjourned to allow a company time to repay the
debt. 7.  I have heard nothing and read nothing filed on behalf of the Companies to lead me to conclude that this is a case where the petitioner
is not entitled to a winding‑up order.  I will therefore make the normal winding‑up orders in respect of both Companies. ","Date of Decision: 8 May 2017(Jonathan Harris)

KERRY FRANCIS MOORE ALSO KNOWN AS KERRY MOORE v. JENNEX CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 790; HCMP 2109/2015 (9 May 2017),"38.  It was suggested that Moore should have agreed to the proposed directions put forward by Lo/Correstone. However, I am unable to
see how it would have saved costs since the procedural and substantive applications and consequent hearings were still required.
The fact that Lo/Correstone did not disagree with the directions sought under the Breach Order did not detract from the fact that
Lo/Jennex were in breach of the Transfer Order which therefore necessitated the enforcement under the Breach Order. 39.  It was also suggested that Lo had incurred significant costs in corresponding with dB&L and in respect of the hearing on 7 December
2016. I have found that the hearing on 7 December 2016 was necessary to deal with anterior procedural issues which could not be dealt
with by consent given the existence of unrepresented parties. Further, part of the correspondence was due to Lo’s/Correstone’s
stance that there was no unreasonable refusal or failure on their part in compliance with the Transfer Order, which Moore had to
refute. By the time DHCJ Kwok SC made the Transfer Order which was binding on Lo, Lo’s anterior reasons for not taking further
steps to effect the transfer as ordered were no longer sufficient answer for his non-compliance of such order. 40.  For all the above reasons, I grant an order that save and except for costs orders made on 7 December 2016, Lo do pay to Moore costs

RE GARSON REAL PROPERTY AGENCIES (H.K.) LTD (IN CREDITORS’ VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION) [2017] HKCFI 1006; HCCW 342/2014 (11 May 2017),"14.  As I have already explained the Official Receiver relied on accounting and other records in reaching their conclusion that Ms Ho
should be allowed to vote the amount of the debt represented by the bonus.  However, it seems to me having regard to the information
that the audited financial statement provides, the better view is that there is sufficient reason to question whether or not Madam
Ho is entitled to prove for the amount of the bonus, to reverse the Official Receiver’s decision which I do. 15.  The consequence of this is that the decision of the meeting to appoint the liquidators, proposed by the Official Receiver which
were the next liquidators on the Panel A list, should not have been reached because Ms Ho’s admitted debt should have been less
than Ms Zhang’s.  It is perhaps a little unfortunate that this application was advanced as although technically Ms Ho proposed
the liquidators, the names were proposed by the Official Receiver and indeed as it transpires the original nominee has become unavailable,
and instead the Official Receiver has proposed two accountants from FTI.  However, as I understand it from Mr Chan, his instructions
are that having come as far as she has Ms Ho would like her preferred liquidators to be appointed and I will therefore so order.
 16.  There will be no committee of inspection.  The liquidators’ costs will be in accordance with the Panel A rates or such order as

 In fact the debtor has taken out a summons in the Court of Appeal in HCMP 1061/2017 dated 8 May 2017 for leave to appeal. 14.  In any event I see no merit in the application.  Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the debtor’s affirmation raise no substantial point.  Paragraphs
5 to 25 appear to seek to challenge my conclusions as to the facts, but I do not discern any legitimate basis.  Within them, paragraphs
18 to 20 complain about a letter which was exhibited to a later affidavit of the petitioner.  However, as recorded in footnote 6
in my decision, I had specifically allowed that letter to be produced, and the debtor was cross‑examined on it.  Paragraphs 26
to 33 again seek to challenge my findings of fact, without any promising basis.  Paragraphs 34, 37 to 39 allege “bad faith” on
the part of the petitioner in other matters which are irrelevant for present purposes.  Paragraphs 35–36 and 40 raise no reason
against my costs decision.  Paragraphs 41 to 45 simply reiterate there are errors in my factual conclusions, without offering any
ground with realistic prospect of success. 15.  Given that each of the petitioner and debtor has failed in her application, taking a global view and broadbrush approach, and having

TOURAY EDRISA v. PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR SECURTIY [2017] HKCFI 836; HCAL 91/2016 (15 May 2017),"67.  I order that the applicant shall pay the costs of the Permanent Secretary in respect of the applications dealt with in this judgment,
to be taxed if not agreed, because the various intended grounds of judicial review are wholly unmeritorious. 68.  As mentioned in the course of the hearing, I am somewhat concerned as to whether it is proper for those acting for the applicant
to raise the ground of discrimination by way of proposed amendments to the Form 86 when there is no apparent factual basis to support
the allegation that the Permanent Secretary has adopted any policy or practice as set out in paragraph 71B of the draft Amended Form
86.  I make no finding as to whether some such policy or practice exists in the absence of evidence.  However, the point is not whether
such policy or practice in fact exists, but whether it is proper to raise an allegation without basis or foundation.  I have given
anxious consideration to the question of whether I ought to allow legal aid taxation in respect of the applicant’s costs incurred
in relation to this proposed ground of judicial review.  On this occasion, I am just prepared to make a general order that the applicant’s
own costs be taxed in in accordance with legal aid regulations, and I so order. 69.  I take this opportunity to remind practitioners that applications for judicial review are often, as in the present case, litigated
on public funds on both sides. The parties are expected to raise and pursue issues reasonably.  The underlying objectives mentioned
in Order 1A, rule 1 of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A, apply as much to

HKSAR v. GEMSLAND HOTELS LTD [2017] HKCFI 882; HCMA 554/2016 (15 May 2017),"15.  I cannot agree.  In my judgment, the appellant was aware of the hearing of the appeal on 2 March this year.  Whether or not the
appellant wanted to send a representative to attend the hearing or what authority it would give to its representative do not matter.
 It would not affect this court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal under the Magistrates Ordinance.  There is no point of law involved, and the argument has no chance of success at all. 16.  The point raised in the letter dated 12 May 2017 is a groundless accusation against Mr Kwong and myself.  I refuse to have Mr Kwong
replaced, nor would I recuse myself in these proceedings.  17.  The appellant’s application has no merit whatsoever.  I dismiss the application and refuse to order the certificate.  I also order
the appellant to pay costs of this application to the respondent, to be taxed if not agreed.",Date of decision: 15 May 2017(C P Pang),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/882.html,"

STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. PAK KWAN HO AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1107; HCMP 1637/2015 (15 May 2017),"13.  On the defence of material change of circumstances, the 2nd defendant so far has not raised any dispute of fact, and it appears to be a pure legal argument. 14.  From the above, I do not see any genuine or substantial issues of fact raised by the 2nd defendant which justify treating the present proceedings as if begun by writ.  This is so particularly bearing in mind that almost
two years have lapsed since the commencement of these proceedings. 15.  I therefore order that the substantive hearing of the Originating Summons be fixed with one day reserved. ",Date of Hearing: 15 May 2017Date of Decision: 15 May 2017,"(Kenneth Wong)

Whether those assertions can be made good by the plaintiff is a matter for another day.  Prima facie the plaintiff is entitled to choose the defendants to its action, and I am satisfied, given the circumstances and the allegations
which it is intended to make, that Fullbox is a necessary party to these proceedings. 75.  Accordingly, an order in terms of the plaintiff’s summons is to be made joining Fullbox as a party to these proceedings. 76.  There was no discussion of costs at the hearing however there would appear to be no reason, on the face of things, why the usual
orders as to costs should not be made.  Therefore, the costs of the Discharge summons are to be to the plaintiff.  As regards the
Joinder summons, this seeks costs of and occasioned by the application, and the amendment, to be in the cause, and I so order.  However
in view of the fact that the parties have not specifically addressed me on costs I direct that both orders are made on an ‘order
nisi’ basis.",Dates of Hearing: 22 and 23 February 2017Date of Decision: 16 May 2017,"(Anthony Houghton SC)

KOO MING KOWN v. PACIFIC ONLINE LTD [2017] HKCFI 859; HCA 2333/2016 (16 May 2017),"32.  The process of the court must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused.  Hence the court has power under Order 18, rule 19(d) and its inherent jurisdiction to strike
out any proceeding which is an abuse of the process of the court to prevent improper use of its machinery as a means of vexation
and oppression in the process of litigation: see Castro v Murray[12].  To prosecute an action which has absolutely no chance of success is a clear case of abuse of the process of the court.  The court
will strike out proceedings which are absolutely groundless, time-barred (Romex Properties Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd[13]), where the pleading is entirely without substance (Hutchvision Asia Ltd v Asia Television Ltd[14]) or where the plaintiff has no locus standi: see Gurdas S Choithramani v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd[15]. On my finding that the Plaintiff has no locus standi, that the Statement of Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action, and that it is frivolous and vexatious, the action has no chance
of success.  It must necessarily follow that the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the court. 33.  For the above reasons, the Statement of Claim as it now stands or as proposed to be amended in the draft Statement of Claim disclosed
no reasonable cause of action.  That being the case, it would serve no purpose to adjourn the hearing of the Striking Out Summons
to enable the Plaintiff to amend it, or to enable him to obtain evidence as to the falsity of Chan’s academic qualification through
third party discovery.  In any event, it is not necessary at this stage of the proceeding because for the purpose of this appeal,
I proceed on the basis that all the allegations contained in the Statement of Claim and the draft Amended Statement of Claim are
true.  Accordingly, the Statement of Claim must be struck out and the action dismissed. It must necessarily follow that the Adjournment
Summons and Discovery Summons must also be dismissed.  In the circumstances, the costs order made by the Registrar, being one which
follows the event, is appropriate. 34.  For the above reasons, I uphold the order of the Registrar dated 24 February 2017 and dismiss the Plaintiff’s appeal with costs.
 I also direct that the Defendant’s costs be assessed summarily in chamber.  The Defendant shall lodge its statement of costs with
my clerk and serve a copy on the Plaintiff within 7 days; and the Plaintiff shall lodge his statement of objection with my clerk

Flat C2 rented out after the old tenant had moved out.  With respect: 33.  To conclude, as in the case of the appeal in respect of the Discovery Summons, I allow the appeal in respect of the Interrogatory
Summons only to the limited extent that the plaintiff should answer on what date the renovation works mentioned in paragraph 8 of

RE FORTUNE KING TRADING LTD [2017] HKCFI 890; HCCW 432/2012 (19 May 2017),"41.  I should add that although submissions have been made by both counsel on the validity of the transfer of the one share in the Company
from Alphred to Satisfactory and the Special Resolution approving the transfer, which are the subject matters of the Trustees’
claim in HCA 1055/2012, I have not made any determination on these issues as they fall outside the question raised in the Summons.
 That said, it appears that in the absence of the consent of the Official Receiver, who is the provisional trustee of the estate
of Mr Luu, any purported disposal of the assets of Mr Luu would be invalid and not binding upon the Trustees. 42.  As for costs, I make a costs order nisi that: 43.  I consider it appropriate to order 50% of the costs of Construction to be paid out of the assets of the Company, as the court derives
considerable assistance from the evidence filed by the Trustees in particular the evidence those concerning the Company which should
have been dealt with by the Liquidators.  Indeed, had the Liquidators performed their duty in investigating and making a decision
on the competing claims, the Summons might not have been necessary.  Given that in the ordinary event, the costs incurred by the
Liquidators in investigating and determining the competing claims would be paid out of the assets of the Company, it would be appropriate
to order part of Construction’s costs to be paid out of the assets of the Company.","21/1/2010

Children remaining in Hong Kong after the Removal and for some reasons, he then changed his mind.  He made no attempt to have any
contact with the Children since the Removal.  The Children now both object to return to Korea. The Son is of an age and maturity
which this court should take into account his views.  Even if the Daughter may not be, it was not suggested that she should return
without her brother.  The Children are now both well settled in Hong Kong and I find it is not in their best interest for them to
be up-rooted again. I thus exercise my discretion and decline to order the return of the Children to Korea. 177.  I will make no orders as to costs, save that the Mother’s own costs be taxed under legal aid regulations.  This is an order nisi,

In support of the view above he said: 12.  As it is, there will be at least two trials taking place in which the defendant and the complainant are the same. If Mr Tracey were
to succeed in his primary submission, there would be three. These parents will, regardless of the outcome of these proceedings, need
to find a way forward which will, as far as possible, resolve the matters between them but which will also expedite a relationship
which will cause as little harm to the children of the family as possible.  No matter what the outcome, the defendant is still the
father of two young girls. There is considerable prejudice to the children of this marriage the longer these proceedings take to
come to a resolution.  I do not accept that the prejudice to the complainant can be minimised by the use of the screen; the relative
shortness of two or three trials rather than one long one or the institution of the Family Court injunction.  Each separate trial
adds pressure upon both the defendant and the complainant and, most importantly, the children. Nor is it in the interest of justice
to have several small and distinct trials which cause greater pressure upon the public purse than one longer one, as experience shows
that they are likely, cumulatively, to take up more time and not less.  My discretion must be exercised taking into account all these
factors and balancing them fairly as between the parties. 13.  The current valid indictment is to be severed. I give leave  for the prosecution to prefer two fresh indictments, one containing
the criminal intimidation charges under Counts 1 and 3 to7 of the current indictment and one containing Counts  2 and 8.   This matter
will proceed initially upon Counts  2 and 8 as reflected in the fresh indictment presumably re drafted as Counts 1 to 2 i.e. the
 indecent assault of 10 June 2016 and the rape on 30 July 2016.  The second indictment containing the counts of criminal intimidation
will remain in the High Court to be listed thereafter for trial if the defendant is found guilty upon either of the indecent assault
or the rape charges so that the same tribunal will be in a position to sentence him for all matters once the remaining charges of
criminal intimidation have been dealt with by jury trial if they are proceeded with.  If the defendant is found not guilty of all
of the charges on the first trial, I give leave for the prosecution to apply to have the criminal intimidation charges transferred
to a lower court to be dealt with and a further hearing will be fixed to hear that matter if it becomes necessary.","Date of Reasons for Decision: 22 May 2017(A P Campbell‑Moffat)

RE CHINA FISHERY GROUP LTD [2017] HKCFI 1815; HCCW 367/2015 (23 May 2017),"7.  HSBC argues that the Companies’ conduct in securing the abandonment of the appeal by entering into a settlement, material parts
of which were contained in an express undertaking to this Court,  when the management of the Companies had already formed the intention
not to comply with material parts of the undertaking was an affront to the Court and in these circumstances it was appropriate for
this Court to signify its displeasure with the Companies’ conduct by ordering costs on an indemnity basis: see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2017, vol 1, para 62/App/12.  HSBC further argues that it is not necessary for the Court to conclude that it was likely that this would
have been sufficient to lead to the dismissal of the summonses, it is sufficient for the Court to take note of the Companies’ conduct
and, if it forms the view the conduct is sufficiently reprehensible, to order costs on a higher basis. 8.  It is clear from Judge Garrity’s findings in his decision of 28 October 2016 that the Judge has found as a fact that the Companies’
management gave undertakings to this Court that at the time they did not intend to comply with.  This is, of course, unacceptable
and does represent an affront to the Court.  I am satisfied that in the circumstances it is appropriate to order costs on an indemnity
basis including the costs of today and I so order. 9.  As I have mentioned there is an application made to the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, by the United
States trustee for an order that documents including those sought in the summonses in these proceedings be provided to him.  As matters
currently stand neither party is able to use the documents for any purpose other than the conduct of these proceedings.  It seems
to me that before any of the parties release the documents they should first obtain an order of this Court.  If the Court in New
York considers that it is desirable that they are released to the United States trustee this is a matter to which I would have regard
and, if it were considered helpful, the parties can consider a protocol for expediting this process.  They might have regard to the
JIN Guidelines.  I will, therefore, make the following order:",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1815.html,"

case, I certainly cannot find malice without first affording Mr Liu and the Company a chance to make full explanations particularly
in light of the footage. 30.  After the hearing, pursuant to the undertaking given through his leading counsel, Mr Mi filed a signed affirmation with minor differences
from the draft Affirmation. The defence complained by way of a letter and Mr Mi came back with a long explanation contained in a
reply letter. I see little substance in the complaint and I regret unnecessary costs have been incurred. Adequate professional communications

proposed added particulars substantially caused the death of the deceased, the delay in the application for amendment would have
caused injustice to the defence.  The particulars of the original indictment had nothing to do with “post-infusion management”.
 The inclusion of the proposed new particulars would have necessitated the defence team to shift or to re-focus their case to meet
the added allegation.  Whilst an adjournment would have given the defence time to prepare, in view of the fact that this case was
set down back in 2016, it would have been extremely difficult to find new trial dates should there be an adjournment. 38.  In any event, Mr Wong had clearly indicated that D1 would not ask for an adjournment as justice delay is justice denied.  Mr Duncan
did not ask for an adjournment either.  Had I allowed the application to amend, the defence team of D1 and D3 would have been forced
to deal with the new area while the trial is going on.  It would have been most unfair to the defence. 39.  For these reasons, I refused the application of the prosecution to amend the indictment.","MAK Wan-ling

suffers from dementia with psychotic features.  She concluded: “He had severe cognitive impairment and the condition is not likely
to improve in the near future given the progressive nature of dementia.”  In her expert medical opinion, she recommended a Hospital
Order of unspecified period under section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.  She suggested that the defendant could serve his sentence in Castle Peak Hospital where provision has been provided for him. 13.  I am satisfied on the evidence of the two psychiatrists that it is necessary in the interests and welfare of the defendant and for
the protection of others that the defendant be admitted to a mental hospital in accordance with section 76(2)(a) and Schedule 4 of
the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.  As suggested by the two psychiatrists appropriate provision has and can be provided to the defendant at Castle Peak Hospital. 14.

an important matter.  Interring the grandparents in a grave in 1977 within the area of the disputed Lots is of itself in my view

said that the police acquiesced simply because it did not further investigate when the applicant could not identify the attackers.
 It cannot be said that TCAB had failed to consider properly or analyse the issue of extended acquiescence nor can it be argued that
the finding on this issue is Wednesbury unreasonable. 20.  So for all the above reasons, I set aside the ex parte leave and this application for judicial review is dismissed. 21.

On the question of costs, by reason of section 43(1)-(2) of the HCO and Order 62 rule 3(12) of the RHC, the starting point is that the person against whom pre-action discovery is sought (eg D) is entitled to a costs order in his favour. But it had been said that “[where] the person against
whom an order is sought is at fault, eg where he has been dilatory in replying to a proper request to disclose documents, the court
may deny him his costs, or, in exceptional cases, order him to pay the applicant’s costs of the application”.[37] 57.  Here, NF made 2 requests to D on 17 May 2016 and 10 March 2017 for the Requested Documents, but there was no reply from him. D even
filed notice of intention to defend after the OS was served on him, but did not file any evidence in opposition. At the Hearing,
he also raised objection to the reliefs sought in the OS. In the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to grant a costs order

L v. X LTD [2017] HKCFI 1043; HCMP 1002/2017 (31 May 2017),"3. The Company raises by its summons a point of principle.  This can be explained most readily by quoting the question of law that the
summons seeks to have determined: 4. It is not practical for that issue or for the other matters which the originating summons requires to be determined to be resolved
today.  The parties have agreed that the timing problem, by which I mean the fact that it will not be possible to determine the originating
summons and the inter-parte summons before it is suggested the limitation period will expire, should be addressed by an order granting leave to issue the writ
without determining the originating summons against an undertaking by the applicant to withdraw the writ which will not be served
in the event that the respondent is successful either on its inter‑parte summons or in defeating the originating summons on some other ground. 5. Because there is some confidentiality in this matter the names of the parties will be redacted but as this is an issue which is likely

HKSAR v. KO CHI-YIP [2017] HKCFI 968; HCCC 65/2017 (1 June 2017),"10.  The response from Mr Wright is that whilst the evidence of the WhatsApp messages was served late, it is not material in the circumstances
of the case to the discount to be afforded to the defendant following his plea of guilty.  I agree with Mr Wright’s submission.
 11.  The WhatsApp messages were clearly known to the defendant and there was always the possibility of them being relied upon by the
prosecution in the case against him.  The defendant made an informed choice to enter a plea of not guilty which he maintained until
after his case was listed for trial.  He was aware of the WhatsApp messages and of his involvement in the crime to which he has admitted.
  The issue in relation to the discount he is to receive is dependent upon the stage of the proceedings that he has entered his plea
of guilty.  A sentencing court has an overriding discretion but there has to be very good reason to adjust the percentage discounts
from those now laid down in Ngo Van Nam.  I see no reason not to follow Ngo Van Nam, and accordingly in the circumstances of this case I will afford the defendant a discount of 25 percent.  12.  As I have noted, the starting point is 13 years and 3 months’ imprisonment which I will reduce by 25 percent to 9 years and 10
months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 1 June 2017Date of Sentence: 1 June 2017,(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/968.html,"

RE TANG YAT CHEUNG [2017] HKCFI 1431; HCB 5436/2014 (1 June 2017),"10.  The trustees also allowed him rent in the sum of $4,500, despite that he is living rent free in his wife’s accommodation.  That
would have allowed him to contribute to his wife’s mortgage repayment, if any, or provided him something to give to his wife as
a loving gesture from a dutiful husband for sharing in her flat. 11.  On the whole, I consider the trustees’ approach of the trustees unreproachable.  They promised to reassess the allowance and to
consider any reasonable ad hoc expenses on production of documentary evidence. In my view, the allowance is reasonable for a person
who has a financial burden to bear.  But, in all fairness to the bankrupt, the allowance may not be as generous as a person of his
income would like to be restrained from spending.  However, if one unfortunately becomes a bankrupt, when managing his financial
affairs, he must bear in mind the principle that one must be just before generous. He has not been prudent in managing his financial
affairs which landed him in bankruptcy.  By reason of the bankruptcy proceedings, his debts are forgiven.  He is allowed to begin
his financial affairs afresh, while his creditors are made to suffer for his impecuniosity.  But all that the law requires of him
is to subject himself to some discipline in his financial management for a few years, pay what he can reasonably afford to pay like
a responsible adult and to instill in himself a sense of responsibility in his financial affairs so that he would not fall again.
 If he is to be allowed to keep and spend all his income and to contribute only a nominal amount to repay his debt, it would be unjust
to his creditors.  Hence, I consider the expenses assessed by the trustees reasonable. 12.  However, in the present case, the bankrupt has found a new employment which almost doubled his past income.  He should be encouraged
to take a more positive attitude in life by being allowed to keep some of the fruits of his effort.  While the trustees have allowed
him $1,900, I think there is room for further increase as the position of the creditors has improved in the past two years as a result
of his effort.  I would therefore revise his monthly allowance to $16,000, but only with immediate effect.  To increase beyond that
level would be unjust to the creditors.","Management fee

LUCY MICHAELS v. CITYBASE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT LTD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 993; HCPI 899/2016 (2 June 2017),"20. Further, this is not a usual application for extension of time because the opportunity offered to the plaintiff was the last opportunity
for the plaintiff to rectify the pleadings.  She was to lodge the draft on or before 24 February 2017.  By the hearing on 11 May
2017, there was a delay of about 3 months.  In all fairness to the 1st defendant, further delay would create pressure and injustice to the defendant when they could not fully understand how to defend
the case.  Unless special reason could be shown, there should be no reason to allow the application for an extension of time.  I
am not satisfied that there was any special reason. 21. In conclusion, I refuse to extend the time for the plaintiff to lodge her draft amended statement of claim.  Since I refuse the application,
there could be only one conclusion, namely that the statement of claim against the 1st defendant should be struck off.  The action against the 1st Defendant should also be dismissed with costs of the action, including the costs of the striking out summons and the hearing on 23
November 2016, 18 April 2017 and 11 May 2017 be to the 1st defendant. Counsel certificate is granted to the 1st and 2nd defendants for the hearing on 23 November 2016. 22.

HKSAR v. LEE SHING PO [2017] HKCFI 1013; HCCC 167/2016 (8 June 2017),"9.  I have borne in mind the principles laid out in HKSAR v Wong Suet Hau & Anor [2002] HKCA 183; [2002] 1 HKLRD 69 in deciding whether any of the drugs were for the defendant’s self-consumption.  I am satisfied that the defendant has had a history
of drug addiction and was likely a user of Ice at the time of the offence.  I am not satisfied, however, that any or some of the
drugs found in his possession were for self-consumption.  Given the circumstances in which the defendant was apprehended, in a public
place in the early hours of the morning with the drugs packaged in 5 plastic bags tucked in his trouser pocket, that this was for
the purpose of trafficking in the drugs in their entirety.  Whilst the defendant may have an addiction to Ice, it does not necessarily
follow that these drugs would be used to satisfy his craving for them.  I have also taken into account that no consumption equipment
was found at his home and it may be that he had access to consumption equipment and drugs elsewhere.   10.  I find that in the circumstances of this case, none of the drugs found in his possession were for self-consumption, and were instead
for the purpose of trafficking in them.  I will therefore make no allowance for self-consumption.  11.  The guideline tariffs for trafficking in Ice, on conviction after trial, are contained in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691.  The guideline starting point for this quantity of drugs is 11 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.  This will be reduced by one third
for the defendant’s guilty plea to 7 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Date of Sentence: 8 June 2017(Kevin Zervos)

useless.  It does not facilitate the finding of exhibits or verification of facts. 101.  Bundles A to C should each start from page one.  Pagination like page 101-83, etc is clumsy.  Care must be taken to ensure that

This issue of conflict is indeed relied on as a major foundation for the removal application and may need to be dealt with when that
application is determined.  But the receivers had already in recent correspondence undertaken that they “will not cast any votes
within or on behalf of CSI which would lead to any dilution of CSI’s shareholding in CSCG”.  Further, as Mr Barlow SC pointed
out, while there had been proposals for the offer or placement of shares since the beginning of the receivership, none had been proposed
on the basis that no shareholders’ approval would be necessary.  He further submitted that if indeed a proposal is made to exercise
the general mandate, notice would have to be given to the receivers as members of the CSCG board and the receivers would be in a
position to ensure that the matter does go to the shareholders such as by convening an EGM to decide the matter and if necessary
to decide if any of the directors should be removed.  There is no dispute that the members in general meeting can revoke by ordinary
resolution any general mandate previously granted.  12. I am not prepared to proceed in this application, as I think the applicants implicitly invited me to, on the assumption that the
receivers were acting or likely to act in a conspiracy with either Tianrui or some outside interests with a view to diluting CSI’s
shareholding in CSCG.  I also noted that only 5 out of the 2,631 plaintiffs in these actions had seen fit to make this application.
 Their position is to be contrasted with that of the 1,554 plaintiffs (2,631 – 1,077) indisputably represented by K & L Gates

This issue of conflict is indeed relied on as a major foundation for the removal application and may need to be dealt with when that

out, while there had been proposals for the offer or placement of shares since the beginning of the receivership, none had been proposed

the general mandate, notice would have to be given to the receivers as members of the CSCG board and the receivers would be in a

AA AND ANOTHER v. THE SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION [2017] HKCFI 1083; HCAL 41/2016 (16 June 2017),"15.  The respondent in its written submissions advances detailed argument in addressing the subject of this amendment.  Most of the points
made, will be relevant to the ground of review concerning the obligation and alleged breach of secrecy.  16.  As to the third proposed amendment, I agree with the respondent that it lacks evidential support.  The applicants assert that the
respondent was informed of the SESC Announcement a day before it was made that involved a breach of secrecy by the Japanese regulators
which the respondent failed to prevent.  There is no evidence that the respondent was informed that the Japanese regulators would
be divulging any confidential information in breach of their secrecy obligation.  The issue as to whether the Japanese regulators
have divulged confidential information in breach of their secrecy obligation, would nevertheless come under consideration in relation
to the ground of review concerning the obligation and alleged breach of secrecy. The proposed amendment is not justified and refused. 17.  In light of the foregoing,

SKYRUN LIGHT INDUSTRY (HONG KONG) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. SWIFT RESOURCES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1092; HCA 1278/2014 (19 June 2017),"89.  For all of the above reasons, I granted the orders at paragraph 11 above at the Hearing. I should add as a final caveat that these
reasons for decision should serve as a reminder to all litigants and practitioners that courts take a dim view of late applications
to move milestone dates. In the post-CJR culture, parties and their lawyers should be frank and upfront on any matter that may potentially affect milestone events so
that the court seized of the matter can evaluate the situation and decide how best to balance the parties’ interests as well the
deployment of court’s resources. The prism is triangular, and it is not for a party to dictate the outcome by withholding information.
In future, litigants should not expect the courts to smile with like kindness as in the present case, and they may have to suffer
the consequences of their own tactical manoeuvres. In a slightly different context (but also in the exercise of the court’s broad
discretion on case management, Ng J (as approved by the Court of Appeal) in In the matter of James Henry Ting made clear unsatisfactory and tactical delay is a material factor that may sway the exercise of discretion against the applicant. 90.  On 16 June 2017, Ps’ solicitors wrote to the court to request inter alia for (a) the trial to be re-fixed in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (b) extension of time to submit Ps’
statement of costs. It was said that if it is possible to re-fix the trial in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel,
then some costs thrown away may be saved. In my view, this proposal would not cause Ds any prejudice since (i) it would be Ps who
may suffer some delay if the re-fixed trial is to accommodate the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (ii) saving some costs thrown
away will only benefit Ds who are liable to pay such costs. It is also appropriate to extend time for Ps to lodge their statement
of costs since they cannot prepare their statement of costs until it is known whether Ps are able to retain their existing counsel
upon re-fixing the trial and thereby save some costs. 91.  In the circumstances, on 16 June 2017, I granted the following directions on paper as follows:",Date of Decision: 13 June 2017Date of Handing Down Reasons for Decision: 19 June 2017,"(Marlene Ng)

the facts of this case fell within consideration number (2.), and I decide to exercise my discretion to deprive the defendant as
to costs, the question then becomes how much.  25.  Mr Suen, first of all, asked me to deprive the defendant of 100 per cent of its costs.  At the hearing, he modified it to 50 per
cent.  In the exercise of my discretion, having taken into account the view formed by the court on the witnesses, the time taken
in court, and as to the overlap of certain witnesses’ testimony with other issues, I have decided to deprive the defendant of 25
per cent of its costs of the action, and therefore I order that the defendant is to have 75 per cent of its costs of the action,
and that includes the counterclaim, to be taxed if not agreed, and I give certificate for two counsel because I believe that this
is a case which justifies attendance of two counsel.  26.  In my judgment, this costs argument cannot be viewed in the same way as considering who is the successful party in an action, and
therefore it cannot be said that simply because the defendant managed to get a cheque from the plaintiff in terms of costs, it is
therefore the successful party.  The reality of the matter is that both parties have to come to court because they cannot agree on
the principle in relation to awarding costs, and therefore in the exercise of my discretion, I believe the fairest order to make

CHAN SHEE KEE v. CHAN GARY KEE AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1123; HCMP 1181/2017 (23 June 2017),"17.  The plaintiff commenced the present action by way of an originating summons in the expedited form (Form 10), instead of the general
form (Form 8).  The plaintiff accepts that, under Order 7, rule 2(1) of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A, the expedited form should only be used if “authorized or required”, and the expedited form is neither authorized nor
required to be used for commencing the present action.  Accordingly, the plaintiff took out a summons dated 19 June 2017 seeking
to correct this irregularity.  In view of the conclusion that I have reached that the declaration sought should not be granted, plainly
the court should not grant any relief under the summons. 18.  The court has, for many years, been drawing practitioners’ attention to the fact the expedited form of the originating summons
should be used only where authorized or required, and that in many cases the expedited form has been wrongly used (see, for example,
the decision of Godfrey J (as he then was) in Hong Kong Ping Jeng Lau Co Ltd v The Incorporated Owners of United Centre, HCMP 2971 of 1989, given on 4 December 1989, and more recently the decision of DHCJ Paul Lam SC in International Automotive Components Group v Xuke Trading Limited, HCMP 564/2017, given on 19 April 2017).  Despite the court’s reminders, the same mistake has kept being repeated.  It must be
emphasised that rules of court are meant to be observed.  It should not be assumed that the court will readily overlook breaches
of the rule regarding the correct form of the originating summons to be used for commencing an action even if it can be said that
no prejudice is suffered by the opposite party as a result of the use of the incorrect form. This is because the use of the correct
form of the originating summons carries implications beyond the mere form of the document, including the timetable for the filing
of evidence and the fixing of the date of hearing of the originating summons. 19.  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s originating summons dated 22 May 2017 and summons dated 19 June 2017 are dismissed.

WO CHUN WAH v. CHAU KWEI YIN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1131; HCPI 903/2014 (23 June 2017),"56.  To sum up, as the Plaintiff inflated his claim, and it was reasonable and necessary for the Board to participate in this action.
Its attitude in the proceedings was impartial, which is beyond reproach. The settlement agreement reached between the Board and the
Plaintiff and my assessments were mainly based on the authorities and arguments put forward by the Board. In my view, the Board only
played a filtering role, and its participation assisted the court in arriving at a correct assessment and also accorded with public
interest and justice. Having considered the circumstances of this action as a whole and balancing the Plaintiff’s interest with
public interest, I conclude that it is not proper to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. The Board performed its function
by screening out unreasonable claims; on the contrary, the Plaintiff seriously inflated his claim. In such circumstances, it is wholly
unreasonable to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. Therefore, I make no order as to costs, and each party shall bear
its own costs. 57.  In summary, I find that the Plaintiff was an employee of the 2nd Defendant and that the Plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result of the 2nd Defendant’s breach of duty of care. I find that the 2nd Defendant is liable to pay to the Plaintiff damages of $1,428,547 together with interest on the principal of $1,395,309 at the rate
of 2% per annum from 18 November 2014 to the date of this judgment, and interest on the principal of $33,238 at half of the judgment
rate from 1 June 2013 to the date of this judgment, and thereafter interest on the outstanding principal at judgment rate until payment. 58.  Turning to costs, I order that the 2nd Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs, such costs to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations, and that there be no order as to costs between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant.",Date of Judgment: 23 June 2017(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1131.html,"

TALAT ZAHID v. CHEUNG FAT METAL TRADING CO LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1139; HCPI 399/2012 (26 June 2017),"90.  The 1st Defendant has also issued contribution and indemnity notice against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.  The 1st Defendant asks for full indemnity of the Plaintiff’s claim on the ground that the accident was directly caused by the negligence
of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. 91.  I disagree that there should be full indemnity. Although the 2nd Defendant is liable for the accident for pressing the wrong button of which the 3rd Defendant is vicariously liable, the 1st Defendant remained the direct employer of the Plaintiff.  As the employer, it had a non-delegable duty to provide a safe system and
a safe place of work for the Plaintiff.  If the 1st Defendant had discharged such duty, the accident could have been avoided.  Judging the blameworthiness of the parties, the 1st Defendant on the one hand and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants on the other should bear equal responsibility for the accident.  I therefore hold that the 1st Defendant is entitled to claim 50% contribution from the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim. 92.  I make a costs order nisi that: (i) the Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of the action against the 1st Defendant and the costs of the assessment of damages proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants; (ii) the 1st Defendant is entitled to the costs of the contribution proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants; and (iii) the Plaintiff’s own costs to be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations.

PETER ANTHONY REID AND ANOTHER v. THE ENVIRONMENT BUREAU [2017] HKCFI 1145; HCAL 90/2016 (27 June 2017),"11.  As is well recognised, judicial review is the means by which the Court of First Instance exercises its general supervisory jurisdiction
over inferior courts, tribunals and other bodies performing public functions.  In general terms, the nature and scope of the judicial
review jurisdiction is largely defined by the relief that a court may grant.  The court on review is required to check the exercise
of the public function that either has no lawful basis or has a lawful basis but has been exercised unfairly or unreasonably.  It
will not review the merits of a decision or attempt itself to perform the task that has been entrusted to the public authority by
law.  12.  Whilst the judicial review jurisdiction is an important means by which the citizen can bring to bear judicial scrutiny over the
exercise of public functions or responsibilities, it is incumbent on an applicant to follow the requirements and procedures as laid
down in the legislative and administrative framework in seeking redress under this jurisdiction.  In the present case, the decisions
or actions sought to be challenged by the applicants were well outside the prescribed time period, and the applicants did not in
any satisfactory manner articulate the public law wrongs that were alleged to have been committed.  The content of the application
was general dissatisfaction with the implementation and development of government policy in relation to waste management which has
been the subject of investigations and reports from the Director of Audit and the Public Accounts Committee respectively.  This was
an inappropriate attempt to invoke the judicial review jurisdiction where little if any effort was made to address the legal requirements
and issues.  13.  Notwithstanding the subject matter of waste management is an important issue of policy, the present application failed to properly
address the relevant legal procedures and issues in order to invoke the judicial review jurisdiction.  The application is therefore
dismissed.",Date of Written Submissions: 1 March 2017Date of Decision: 27 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

"HKSAR v. HO WAI KI, EDITH [2017] HKCFI 1147; HCMA 248/2017 (27 June 2017)","17.  Mr Polson takes issue with the expert’s evidence on the basis that it is a bare assertion without explaining how the workmanship
was poor and how the material was inferior.  As noted, the statement of the expert was admitted into evidence by having her statement
read out in open court and therefore was not the subject of cross-examination.  Whilst the expert could have explained in greater
detail the lack of quality of the handbag in arriving at her conclusion, it is the case that she is familiar with Chanel products
and its quality, and has identified by the poor workmanship and inferior material that it is not one of their products.  18.  I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before the Magistrate, including the admission the appellant made at the time of her
arrest that this was a “highly imitated” handbag, the nature and circumstances of the transaction, the price difference between
the genuine handbag and the handbag sold by the appellant, and the expert evidence that this was not a genuine Chanel handbag, that
this supports to the requisite standard the conviction in question. 19.  The appeal is therefore dismissed. ",Date of Hearing: 27 June 2017Date of Judgment: 27 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

HKSAR v. LIU YEE LUN [2017] HKCFI 1152; HCCC 163/2017 (28 June 2017),"8.  On the individual approach, the following calculation can be made.  The quantity of ketamine involved is 57.4 g and according to
the guidelines laid down in S for J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1, a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of cocaine involved is 5.42 g and according to the guidelines
laid down in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370, a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of Ice involved is 6.21 g and according to the guidelines laid
down in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125, a sentence of 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  This would make a total sentence of 13 years and 6 months’ imprisonment
and obviously taking into account the totality principle, an adjustment downwards would need to be made. 9.  On the combined approach, most of the drugs were ketamine, and applying the sentencing guidelines for ketamine to the total quantity
of narcotic involved, which would be about 70 g, a sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  The difficulty
I have with the combined approach is that for small quantities of cocaine and Ice, the sentencing tariff is higher than that for
ketamine.  There needs to be an adjustment.  The conversion is one way of doing it and I will be guided by it, but as indicated there
is a difference in the final sentence depending on which drug the total narcotic has been converted to which is then applied to its
sentencing tariff.  10.  I will impose a starting point, applying the conversion submitted by the prosecution, of 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment which
I will reduce by one third for the defendant’s early guilty plea to 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. ",Date of Hearing: 28 June 2017Date of Sentence: 28 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

as soon as possible so that he could return to look after his father and children in Pakistan.  21.  In sentencing the appellant the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452.  The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline sentence of 15 months imprisonment upon a plea of guilty in relation to section 38AA offences.  The appellant was convicted after trial and as such the correct starting point to be adopted is one of 22 months and 2
weeks imprisonment.  The appellant did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the starting point.  22.  Although the magistrate considered enhancing the sentence he decided not to do so, it could be said that the magistrate was generous
to the appellant in not enhancing the starting point as the appellant had a previous similar offence.  In the circumstances, the
sentence is neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.  Accordingly the appeal against sentence is dismissed. ",(S. D’ Almada Remedios)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1158.html,"

HKSAR v. TAM TAK CHEUNG [2017] HKCFI 1163; HCCC 138/2016 (29 June 2017),"18.  The indecent assault was particularly shocking and grievous.  In all likelihood it would have escalated into further serious sexual
violence on the victim if not for the fortuitous intervention of the stranger.  The defendant had kissed and fondled the victim and
inserted his fingers into her vagina, and he was clearly contemplating having sexual intercourse with her, when he pushed her onto
the ground and unzipped his pants.  19.  It is the duty of the courts to ensure that violation of a person’s modesty and dignity in cases of indecent assault is soundly
deprecated.  This was a serious case of indecent assault which warrants severe punishment.  I note that the maximum penalty for indecent
assault is 10 years’ imprisonment.  Mr Boyton submitted the case of HKSAR v Keita Ali,CACC 419/2015, 21 March 2017, unreported, by means of comparison where the appellant indecently assaulted an elderly woman and was
sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment.  Comparing indecent assault cases is of limited utility because no two cases are exactly alike,
and the sentence to be passed will in any event necessarily involve applying the relevant sentencing principles to the particular
circumstances of the case.  What makes this a serious case of indecent assault was the sexual molestation perpetrated by the defendant
on the victim by kissing and fondling her and inserting his fingers in her vagina.  In light of the circumstances of the present
indecent assault, I would adopt a starting point of 5 years’ imprisonment.  20.  As a result of the defendant having pleaded guilty, he is entitled to a one third discount, and accordingly the sentence on Count
1 is reduced from 6 years and 6 months to 4 years and 4 months’ imprisonment, and on Count 3 is reduced from 5 years to 3 years
and 4 months’ imprisonment.  Taking into account the totality principle, and in order to arrive at a sentence that reflects the
overall criminality and to avoid any overlap between the offences, I order that 20 months of the sentence on Count 3 run consecutively
to the sentence on Count 1, thus resulting in a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment.","Date of Sentence: 29 June 2017(Kevin Zervos)

conclusion either way on whether the plans should be disapproved under s 16(1)(j).  It follows that Ground 1 is not made out and that this court should not direct the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal. 43.  For the above reasons, the application for judicial review succeeds on Ground 2, but Ground 1 fails. There will be an order of certiorari for the Tribunal’s decision to be brought up to the High Court and quashed, and the matter is remitted to it for decision in the
light of this judgment. 44.  While the BA’s application is granted, I have rejected Ground 1 and the associated contention that the Tribunal should be directed

SKYRUN LIGHT INDUSTRY (HONG KONG) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. SWIFT RESOURCES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1196; HCA 1278/2014 (6 July 2017),"20.  Ninthly, in respect of Item D3, Ps claimed 5 hours for preparation for the Hearing and 2nd PTR at $22,500. Ds claimed this was excessive and a legal clerk or paralegal spending 0.5 hour at $1,000/hour would suffice. I do
not understand the nature of such objection. Since Ds had no objection to Item D4 (ie attendance at the Hearing and 2nd PTR by Ps’ solicitor fee-earner), such solicitor fee-earner rather than any legal clerk or paralegal should be the one who had
to prepare for such hearings. That said, given the allowances above for attendance on counsel (including conference with counsel)
and perusal of documents, and further given the involvement of counsel for the Hearing and 2nd PTR, even on a generous indemnity basis, I am unconvinced the solicitor fee-earner would have to spend much time for preparation
for the hearings. I allow 1.5 hours at $6,750 for Item D3. 21.  Tenthly, in respect of Item E2, Ps claimed counsel’s fees for conference for 1.5 hours in the sum of $6,750, which translated
to an hourly rate of $4,500. I find such rate reasonable for counsel of 20 years’ experience. As explained in paragraph 16 above,
there was no duplicate between this item and Item C3. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 16-17 above, I allow counsel’s fees
at $6,750 for Item E2. 22.  Taking into account all of the above matters, having considered the nature and scope of the present action and the Summons, the
affirmations filed in support of such summons, the skeleton submissions and list of authorities, what transpired at the Hearing and
2nd PTR, the involvement of counsel, and considering all circumstances, I am satisfied the claim for costs in Ps’ Statement of Costs
(save for the items I have adjusted down) was not unreasonable or disproportionate. Ps’ total costs on their Statement of Costs
are assessed at $287,325 (being $600 (B1) + $600 (B2) + $22,500 (C1) + $9,000 (C2) + $11,250 (C3) + $4,500 (D1) + $22,500 (D2) +

now become enforceable as a judgment of this court.  The Company does not suggest that it cannot pay the Award.  It simply refuses
to do so and takes the position that there is nothing the Defendant can do about it in Hong Kong. This seems to me to be unacceptable.
 The Company wishes to take advantage of Hong Kong’s financial system and the legal system that underpins it.  Hong Kong’s legal
system and courts provides investors both domestically and internationally with confidence in the reliability and integrity of the
financial system.  The Company’s refusal to honour the Award shows disregard for the integrity of our legal system and, in a non-technical
sense at least, contempt for the High Court of Hong Kong.  If the Company wishes to be listed in Hong Kong it should honour the Award
and respect the decision of Mimmie Chan J.  There is a public interest in steps being taken to remedy this conduct and to disabuse
other Mainland companies of the idea that they can take the benefit of access to Hong Kong’s financial system without the burden
of complying with our laws.  In the circumstances of this case the obvious and appropriate step is the winding up of the Company
in Hong Kong and the delisting of its H shares. 32.  Before ending this judgment, I should deal with a preliminary point taken by Mr Coleman.  The originating summons originally sought
only a permanent injunction enjoining the Defendant from presenting a petition.  It was subsequently amended to replace the injunction
with the declaration.  Mr Coleman argued that the question of whether or not the second core requirement was satisfied was not one
that justified enjoining the presentation of a petition.  It could not sensibly be suggested that the answer to the question was
clear and that it would be an abuse to present a petition.  The Company was simply trying to avoid the difficulties caused by presentation;
difficulties that would be the result of its own intransigence rather than abusive conduct by the Defendant.  I was referred to Re Sinom (Hong Kong) Limited [12] in which it was held by Kwan J that a creditor should not be prevented from issuing a petition unless the petition was bound to fail.
 I agree that this is normally the correct approach.  In the present case I have deviated from it because it has seemed to me given
the extensive argument I have heard that the most practical course is to determine the issue immediately on the originating summons
rather than delay it to the hearing of a petition. 33.  I will dismiss the originating summons.  I will make a costs order nisi that the Company pays the Defendant’s costs.  Given the views that I have expressed in [31] I consider it appropriate that the
costs be assessed on an indemnity basis to reflect what in my view is the unethical conduct of the Company.","andARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED

to uphold the DPO Order and DPO Review Order on arguments that did not find favour with this court. In the circumstances, he must

considered all the circumstances, I grant a costs order nisi that C shall pay D2 costs of and occasioned by the Appeal to be taxed if not agreed.","(D)有薪假期

particularly when he is now married and has a family to support.  Coupled with the remorsefulness of the appellant and the support
of his sister and father as set out in his grounds of appeal the appellant should stand a good chance of rehabilitation after drug
addiction treatment.  The court should not lightly give up helping him in this regard. 12.  The magistrate correctly considered the issue of proportionality between the offence and sentence before making the detention order.
 Taking into account the criminal record of the appellant, the nature and value of property involved in the offence and the whole
circumstances of the case an immediate custodial sentence is inevitable.  An order of detention in the DATC is a much better option
than imprisonment and is not out of proportion with the criminality of the appellant in the present case.  The court is of the view
that the sentence is neither excessive nor wrong in principle. 13.  Appeal against sentence is dismissed.",(Joseph Yau)Judge of the Court of First Instance,of the High Court,/2017/1232.html,"

CLEVER OCEAN GROUP LTD v. AMYLIN ENTERPRISES LTD [2017] HKCFI 1584; HCMP 3597/2016 (12 July 2017),"14.  It seems to me clear from Mr Miller’s report, read in its totality and in particular para 8(m)(n) and para 9(m)(n), that Ms Liu
was validly appointed as administrator of her late husband’s estate and was entitled to direct that she be appointed the applicant’s
sole director and that the share in the company be transferred into her name.  I can see no reason on the face of the report to doubt
this conclusion and that at present Ms Liu is authorised to commence the present application.  15.  The only issue is whether the Companies have demonstrated any credible reason to think that a co-administrator will be appointed
by the BVI court and that if it does this might lead to Ms Liu’s authority being interfered with.  I think not.  First, it seems
to me that given Mr Lin’s limited BVI assets and Ms Liu and her sons’ right to the estate of her late husband, there is no reason
to think that the BVI court’s initial willingness to appoint one administrator would be changed.  Secondly, it seems to me highly
doubtful that if the BVI court did appoint a co-administrator it would be either Ms Liu’s father-in-law or her brother-in-law (the
other director of the Companies).  The evidence before me clearly demonstrates that trust between Ms Liu and her father‑in-law
and brother-in-law has broken down, and I would expect somebody independent to be appointed if a co-administrator is to be appointed
at all.  I can see no sensible reason for thinking that they would think it desirable or prudent to take a different approach to
the present matter to Ms Liu.     16.  I will therefore make orders for the convening of EGMs of the respondent companies.  I will hear counsel on the form of the orders

to be imposed should be one which will help the appellant get rid of her drug addiction.  The magistrate rightly came to the conclusion
that the appellant should undergo a period of cure and rehabilitation in an addiction treatment centre. 15.  There are ample authorities, notably HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] HKCA 61; [2001] 1 HKC 261, saying that for the type of offence committed by the appellant, the starting point is in the range of 12 to 18 months imprisonment.
 As such, an order of detention in the DATC is not out of proportion with the criminality of the appellant in the present case.

it notified Mr Lau, advising him of the nature and likely consequences of the proceedings, informing him of his rights, and giving
him the opportunity to be heard on the matter, even the opportunity to elect an oral hearing if he wished to have one.  Similarly,
the Appeals Tribunal should have addressed the issue of “previous practice” as well as considering the factual dispute that had
been raised by the applicant in relation to the complainants’ dealings with the insurance agent.  These are matters that most likely
would have warranted an oral hearing.  128.  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that a number of procedural irregularities took place before the IARB and the Appeals
Tribunal that violated fundamental principles of natural justice, as well as the requirements of Clause 39, and that the Appeals
Tribunal left unresolved various critical issues raised by the applicant.  In line with my judgment, I therefore make an order certiorari
quashing the decision of the 2nd respondent, including the payment order.  I remit the matter back to the Appeals Tribunal for rehearing and reach a decision according
to law and to any relevant comment in this judgment.  129.  It seems to me that on the question of costs the applicant should receive its costs, but I will require argument on the issue in

I note that the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence of using a copy of a false instrument, contrary to section 74 of the Crimes Ordinance.  The head sentence for such an offence is imprisonment for 14 years.  The magistrate applied the sentencing guidelines for an offence
contrary to section 7A of the Registration of Persons Ordinance which in the circumstances of the case was appropriate.  He noted that a proper sentence in such circumstances is one of 15 months’
imprisonment on a plea of guilty.  He correctly took the view that there was no difference in terms of culpability where a photocopy
of a forged identity card is used.  He accordingly imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment on the appellant for this offence.
 8.  The magistrate ordered that the terms of imprisonment on each offence run concurrently.  9.  I have considered the sentences imposed by the magistrate and his reasons for doing so and there is no basis for this Court to interfere

as outdated.  The adjudicator said at paragraphs 12 and 13 of his decision he was careful to differentiate between the COI content
and the Directors commentary thereon.  He reminded himself at that point that in deciding the petition before him his function separate
from the function of the Director in making a decision.  He viewed the material relied on by the Director objectively and afresh.
 The applicant’s criticism is a bare assertion.  The COI material is varied, recent, relevant and detailed.  This ground is rejected. 34.  I find the adjudicator’s decision to be without fault.  The adjudicator analysed the material, claims and evidence carefully;
logically and with caution.  He also applied the correct standard of proof.  The applicant’s complaints against the adjudicator
and the procedure undertaken are not substantiated.  This finding also applies to the hearing before the Director of Immigration
and his findings. 35.  Bearing the crucial issues in mind and applying the standard of review in considering leave, I find the applicant has not demonstrated
he has a reasonably arguable claim with a realistic prospect of success.  There were no errors of law or any evidence of procedural
unfairness.  The decision was not Wednesbury unreasonable.  I see no error in his findings of fact.  Therefore, leave to apply for

Ng’s written submissions are capable of dealing with all the arguments advanced on behalf of the relevant defendants. The supporting
work to be undertaken by the plaintiff’s solicitors should be minimal. I believe 1.5 professional hours of the handling solicitor

HKSAR v. WONG KAM LUNG [2017] HKCFI 1305; HCCC 188/2017 (24 July 2017),"10.  The offence calls for a period of disqualification which for a first conviction should be not less than 6 months.  I therefore order
that the defendant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months.  This order is somewhat
meaningless in light of the substantial term of imprisonment that has been passed in relation to the drug trafficking offence. 11.  Ms Pauline Leung, on behalf of the defendant, has very helpfully taken me to the photographs of the scene where the defendant was
arrested which depicts the position and damage of the vehicles.  Whilst it would appear that it was not a significant collision between
the vehicles, it nevertheless was an attempt by the defendant to avoid apprehension which put the safety of the police officers at
risk.  As an aggravating factor to the circumstances of the drug trafficking offence, I would have enhanced the sentence by 2 months’
imprisonment.  However, as the defendant has been sentenced in relation to the two separate offences of dangerous driving and drug
trafficking, and taking into account the totality principle, I order that 2 months of the sentence on the dangerous driving offence
run consecutively to the sentence on the drug trafficking offence.  12.  The defendant is therefore sentenced to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 24 July 2017Date of Sentence: 24 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

"THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHINA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC v. KPMG (A FIRM) AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1324; HCCW 435/2012 (26 July 2017)","11.  It is not suggested that either the 2016 or 2017 Orders are unclear or that there is much room for argument about what KPMG HK have
done, or not as the case may be, by way of compliance with them.  If the Liquidators, consider KPMG HK do not have a legitimate excuse
for non-compliance the appropriate course is to commence contempt proceedings. 12.  I also have another more practical objection to the way in which the Liquidators wish to progress the matter.  If I have to decide
the summonses on the basis of the evidence filed to date, which is Mr Manzoni’s preferred course, I cannot see how I could be expected
to do other than make an order substantially in the terms of the first part of paragraph 27 of the February Decision, which would
not advance the matter very far; although I note in passing that there may be a material difference in the position in respect of
the audit working papers for the financial years up to and including 2007, when the audit was done by the KPMG HK and from 2008,
when as I understand the position, KPMG Huazhen carried out the audit on the Mainland as a component auditor.  If the question of
KPMG HK’s ability to direct KPMG Huazhen to take such steps as are necessary for KPMG HK to comply with the 2016 and 2017 Orders
is going to have to be resolved by further evidence and possibly cross-examination, particularly, having regard to the importance
of the Liquidators having access to the Documents and the nature of KPMG HK’s reasons for failure to comply, this should be by
way of contempt proceedings. 13.  In conclusion I will dismiss the two summonses.  I will make a costs order nisi that the costs are paid out of the assets of the Company with a certificate for two counsel.",Date of Hearing: 6 July 2017Date of Decision: 26 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

FENG LISHE v. XU ZHIQIANG [2017] HKCFI 1365; HCA 2178/2015 (26 July 2017),"36.  However, when what the court is asked to do is to grant an injunction pending appeal, and not pending trial, so as to preserve the
position pending appeal, the question is not whether there is a serious question to be tried on the merits at trial, but whether
the appeal has a real prospect of success: see Gee, Commercial Injunctions (6th ed) at §24-037.  Both counsel accept this.  But where the application is for an injunction pending an application for leave to appeal
to be made to the Court of Appeal, then the threshold must be whether that application has a real prospect of success.  In the light
of my decision above regarding leave to appeal, and for the reasons given above, I do not think that this threshold is satisfied. 37.  For reasons above, I dismiss China Art’s summonses dated 15 June 2017, 6 July 2017 and 19 July 2017 with costs to Xu with certificate

HKSAR v. LAM HING CHIT [2017] HKCFI 2435; [2018] 5 HKC 441; HCCC 75/2017 (26 July 2017),"21.  In my opinion, the impugned statement in paragraph 11 of the witness statement in the depositions of Ms Lui is not mere narrative.
 It is concerned with arrangements to pick up in Hong Kong drugs which had been packed on the mainland and to ensure that Ms Lui
understands the arrangements and the participants in the packing operation which were a prelude to its delivery.  In my judgement,
this is clearly a statement to advance the interests of the conspiracy. 22.  The only remaining question is whether the inability of counsel for the accused to cross-examine Fu Chai would be a proper basis
for the exclusion of the impugned passage.  I rather suspect that if Fu Chai was available, he would most likely be on the current
indictment as an accused and if that were the case his availability to the present accused for cross examination would depend on
exigencies of a joint trial and it would be by no means a sure thing that he would conduct his case in a manner which would expose
him to the cross examination of the present accused.  In my judgement the efficacy of cross-examining Fu Chai is a concept substantially
more apparent than real.  23.  Finally, in making the order that the impugned passage is admissible as an act or declaration in furtherance of the conspiracy,
I also make it plain that in the event that the evidence presents at trial in a manner which would mean that the factual underpinnings
of, in particular, my determination that there exist reasonable evidence that the impugned passage was an act or declaration in furtherance
of the conspiracy, were to fall away then I would be in duty bound to reconsider the ruling.  Subject to that qualification these
are my reasons for holding the impugned passage in paragraph 11 of the statement of Ms Lui to be admissible as an act or declaration
in furtherance of a conspiracy involving herself, the accused and Fu Chai.",Date of Ruling: 26 July 2017(Andrew Bruce SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2435.html,"

attitude. 28.  As I have said, the Father did not have a hopeless case, and it was necessary at the time for him to invoke the court’s wardship
proceedings in order to try to bring L back to Hong Kong.  He had no ulterior motive and although the language he used in his affirmations
and his criticisms of the Mother indicated he is an emotive person, it could not be said that he had conducted the litigation in
relation to L’s care and control in a way other than bona fide in the best interests of L. 29.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I am unable to say the Father’s litigation conduct in relation to L’s

ignored them and refused to provide them with the details for payment. 49.  Finally, it is trite law that there are conditions to be satisfied before the court would imply any terms in a contract.[6]  The principal test remains one of necessity, and the question to be answered is whether the term is necessary to give effect to
the intention of the parties or to achieve the parties’ objective in entering into the contract rather than whether it is necessary
to make the contract work at all.[7] It is clear that the rights and obligations between the Plaintiff (lender), the 1st Defendant (borrower) and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (guarantors) are well regulated by the terms of the contracts made between them, to be supplemented by various legal principles
under the law of surety and guarantee.  There is simply no room for the court to imply any further terms as contended for by the
Defendants in the relevant loan facilities agreements.  There is also no factual basis to support that the Plaintiff was in breach
of some of these alleged implied terms, for example, the Plaintiff or its predecessor had misrepresented the financial position between
the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant or the Plaintiff had made premature demands for repayment of debt.[8] 50.  For the above reasons, the Defendants have failed to establish any triable issues either as to liability or quantum, and Master

The following statements of principle are not controversial. This rule enables a court to review an earlier case management decision
relating to expert evidence. Although the rule existed even before the Civil Justice Reform (“CJR”), the exercise of discretion
under this rule should be guided by the objectives of the CJR.  The rule may be invoked irrespective of whether the previous order
was a consent order or an order made by the court. The circumstances pertaining when the previous order was made would be a relevant
consideration in deciding how the discretion under the rule ought to be exercised. Given this rule, it is unnecessary to resort to
the traditional ways[6] to challenge a previous consent order that has been made relating to expert evidence. The rule may be invoked by a party or on the
court’s own motion. 16.  The critical factor, which is clearly fact sensitive and requires further consideration in an appropriate case, is what constitutes
“sufficient cause” to revoke or vary a previous order made or direction given in relation to expert evidence.  Whether or not
there are fetters to the court’s exercise of discretion under this rule, such as proof of erroneous information at the time of
the original order or direction; or proof of subsequent event changing the basis on which the original order or direction was made;
or a need to establish some material change of circumstances, is best left to be debated when the appropriate case arises.  In this
case, I had requested the parties to explain why expert evidence on the condition of the road surface in question was not obtained
and, inferentially, to consider whether or not expert evidence on the condition of the road surface at the time of the accident ought
to be adduced.  Had Mr Azari been able to express an expert opinion on the subject, which would have been of assistance to me in
determining the condition of the road surface at the time of the accident, that would have constituted sufficient cause to enable
me to invoke the rule to vary the previous consent order made in this action in relation to expert evidence and to grant leave to
the parties to adduce expert evidence on this issue.  If the court seeks expert evidence to assist it and such expert evidence is
available and fulfils the criteria of admissibility, as expert evidence and conforming to the objectives of the CJR, then that would
constitute “sufficient cause” to vary a previous consent order made in the action in relation to expert evidence. 17.  The plaintiff has failed in his application to adduce expert evidence but has succeeded on the jurisdiction point.  The defendants

DENNIS KWOK HON MING v. POON SUI CHEONG ALBERT AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1375; HCMP 1528/2013 (3 August 2017),"11.  In my view, issues as to cross-examination will arise under Paragraph 4(a) of the Directions, and there is no need for separate
provision to be made under Paragraph 3.  I understood it to be common ground at the 28 June 2017 hearing that the parties would be
entitled to cross-examine the Independent Valuers. 12.  The costs order nisi made on 7 July 2017 has become final.  In respect of the costs relating to the Directions thereafter, consistently with the previous
costs order, costs be in the cause. The Directions are required as part of the proceedings, as a prelude to the valuation determination,
which follows from the liability determination.  13.  The Majority Shareholders are directed to lodge the Directions for approval within 3 days, along with a soft copy in Word format.","Date of Hearing:

MAI CUITING v. MAK CHUI FONG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1374; HCMP 2619/2016 (4 August 2017),"52.  In the present case, P only sought an estate account of which Ds had a duty to provide.  As pointed out by Mr Chan, she did not
seek a removal of Ds.  However, in my view, this does not mean that Ds could simply ignore preparation of the estate account.  Ds
should have responded to the 30.05.16 Letter from P’s solicitors by indicating a time frame as to when Ds would provide the estate
account to P.  There was no such indication.  Ds then seemed to change solicitors yet again.  Up to the Hearing, there was no evidence
that Ds had taken step to prepare estate account by that time. 53.  P succeeded with her application and she should be entitled to costs.  If her costs and Ds’ costs are ordered to be paid out of
the Estate this means P would have to bear 1/7 of not only her own costs but also 1/7 of Ds’ costs.  I do not see why P should
have to bear any part of her own costs or Ds’ costs.  54.  In any event, having considered all the circumstances in the present case, I have come to the view that Ds had defaulted in discharging
their duties as administrators, and should be personally liable for the costs of P’s successful claim against them, on indemnity
basis.  Ds should also be deprived of their own costs to be paid out of the Estate.",Date of Plaintiff’s Reply Submission on Costs: 21 July 2017Date of Decision: 4 August 2017,"(Bebe Pui Ying Chu)

they knew on 1 April 2017 when they received the ruling of the Shanghai First Instance Court that it had no jurisdiction to hear
the case and concluded that Hong Kong courts have exclusive jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, they made the present application for a
stay on 3 April 2017.  Ms Ho also submitted that in breach of the requirements under Order 12, rule 8, the defendants had failed
to state its ground of stay and that they had failed to produce the rulings from the Shanghai courts declining jurisdiction.  47.  The way the defendants have conducted their case so far might be less than satisfactory but they did not result in any substantial
delay in the proceedings.  On the timing of filing of the present application, the defendants might be excused for doing so as they
were going to appeal the decision of the Shanghai First Instance Court.  Unless they made the stay application, they would have to
file their defence thereby losing the opportunity to challenge jurisdiction.  48.  In the premises, I order that the costs of this application be to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for

say that the concern of the Liquidators as stated in paras 41-45 of Borelli 4 deserves serious investigation.  Pending the availability
of the opinions from the Mainland law experts and the full argument on the issues by both parties, I accept that the court should
extend the validity of the Protective Writs pending full argument on the issue in the R 8A Applications. 31.  KPMG may also argue that the effluxion of time is too great and that further extension would cause difficulties because of the loss
of documents and depreciation of memories.  However, the Liquidators have provided an account of what happened since the last application
for extension of validity of the 1st and 2nd KPMG Protective Writs in Section C of Borrelli 3.  In the past 12 months or so, the Liquidators have been pressing KPMG to produce
documents.  It is fair to say that there was delay and obstruction on the part of KPMG making it difficult for the Liquidators to
carry out the investigation work.  The evidence at this stage shows that KPMG is responsible for such delay and so the effluxion
of time should not be a factor to deny the Extension Applications.  In particular, there should be no destruction of documents given
the preservation order in place by KPMG. 32.  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the validity of the Protective Writs should be extended to June 2018 which provides a

as it was at the time of the Magistrate’s determination on 30 January 2015, for reasons mentioned above, I am of the view that
the Magistrate ought to have considered himself bound by the decision of Poon J and ruled accordingly. In any event, this court has
now before it the judgments of the Court of Appeal and Court of Final Appeal and must be guided by those judgments when deciding
how the present appeal should be disposed of. 28.  For the foregoing reasons, I hold that:- 29.  Accordingly, the Magistrate’s answer to Question (2) is set aside, and that question is remitted to another magistrate for fresh
consideration.  I have been given to understand by Mr Man that the prosecution may apply to the magistrate for an adjournment of

set aside.  I assess the amount of GMI’s proof of debt at US$6,666,519.09.  Had Wu properly assessed GMI’s proof of debt, the
debt owed to GMI would have far outweighed the aggregate of all other creditors’ claims and Mr Pang’s appointment as liquidator
would not have been approved.  His appointment must also be set aside.  East China should reconvene a creditors’ meeting in accordance

the Customs & Excise officer speaking to him had said he had never been told that, he then replied that he must have said it
himself.  “I hate people,” he said, “who take white powder”.  Then he asked to be allowed to help in this situation because
Fei Sing had taken advantage of him and his integrity. 20.  I have had the opportunity—and it is a considerable advantage — of having considered the evidence over a number of days.  I
have, obviously, to be very careful in my approach not to usurp the functions of a jury.  The test that has to be applied which is
referred to in Secretary for Justice v Tang Sau Ling [2013] HKCA 251; [2013] 2 HKLRD 174, applicable to this kind of application, is whether a jury, properly directed, could, may or might conclude that the only reasonable
inference to be reached on all the evidence is that the defendant’s account was a false one and to cover his knowledge that the
package contained drugs. 21.  I have decided, on reflection, that this is a matter for the jury and, accordingly, the application is dismissed.",Date of Ruling: 14 August 2017(M. Stuart Moore),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1919.html,"

D’s claim on quantum meruit is not simply based on introduction of the clients referred by P but also services provided in handling their cases.  The parties were not equal in blameworthiness or culpability in that under Rule 4, D would be the one who was in breach of rules
and D ought to know the rules.  Even though the capacity in which P worked in D’s firm is disputed, D’s case is that P’s role
was to liaise with D’s clients, to collect documents from clients and to find new clients for D’s firm mainly on personal injuries
cases[19].  P should be allowed to pursue a claim for reasonable remuneration for the services provided by him.  I am not prepared to dismiss
or strike out P’s claim on the basis of quantum meruit. 69.  For the reasons stated above, both Questions 1 (a) and (b) should be answered in the affirmative.

not having notice of the demand notice was not a result of any neglect on her part.  He noted in particular that she did not have
a lock on her mailbox and this neglect on her part would have attributed to her not receiving notice of the demand notice.  I reject
this submission. It is not uncommon not to have a lock on your mailbox and it will depend on the situation and circumstances of the
mailbox and the building in which it is located.  As explained by the appellant, she resides in a secure building where the number
of flats is small and where misdirected mail has only occurred on two or three occasions.  15.  I am of the view that in light of the additional evidence and in the circumstances of the case, the demand notice did not come to
the appellant’s attention because of any neglect on her part. 16.  For the reasons that I have given, I would allow the appeal and would rescind the order for the appellant to pay the additional

 The business of the Company was profitable during 2003 to 2012 before such change. 16.  Thirdly, the significant loss suffered in recent years by reason of the investments would be thrown down the drain if the Company

allow the appeal and proceed to consider the quantum of security for costs that I should order. 37.  Base on the skeleton bill provided by the defendants[19], the solicitors costs incurred up to October 2016 is HK$1,292,257.00 and the estimated costs up to conclusion of trial is HK$1,256,863.00.
 The total disbursement, largely consisting of counsel fees and expert fee, is HK$2,464,500.00.  The total sum is thus HK$5,013,620.00.
 Mr Lam SC acknowledged that this court can take a broad-brush approach and needs not order full security.  He fairly asked the court
to assess and order what this court considers as reasonable security for costs.  In the end, I consider that HK$2 million is a reasonable
sum to be ordered as security for costs. 38.  I make the following orders:",Date of Judgment:  18 August 2017(Jason Pow SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2017/1483.html,"

of action against the defendant and the claims against the defendant are struck out, there is no reason to join Mr Chan as a defendant
in the present action.  The plaintiff can always commence another action against Mr Chan, if he insists that he has a valid claim
against Mr Chan.  Thus, the application to join Mr Chan as the 2nd defendant in this action should also be dismissed. 49.  By reasons aforesaid, the Amendment Application should be dismissed, the Statement of Claim be struck out on the grounds that it
discloses no reasonable cause of action and is frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court, and the plaintiff’s

HKSAR v. AHMED SHAMIR [2017] HKCFI 1490; HCCC 176/2016 (18 August 2017),"17.  I do not accept that the defendant was coached at all, at least not in the sense that any C&E officer told him what to say and
provided him with information about which the defendant had absolutely no prior knowledge.  Although it was not canvassed with any
of the officers, I accept it is possible that conversations took place in the intervening period, conversations which the defendant
alluded to in evidence and in which the defendant volunteered all sorts of information which was happily received by the C&E
team.  I say this because the defendant said he had spoken with C&E over those two days.  He is generally effusive.  He was effusive
in interview and in evidence.  It is difficult to control him once in full flow.  This can be seen on the VRI and was evident in
court.  It is possible that the defendant believes that anything he said during that time was the subject of what he likes to term
“coaching” whereas and in fact it was simply a one‑way flow of information which the C&E accepted and no doubt, urged him
to repeat under interview. 18.  I come to this view because the defendant made it clear under cross examination that he only gave in interview information he agreed
with (whether that was coached or not) and where he disagreed with it, he did not say it.  Two matters arise from that.  Firstly,
that he appears to have conceded that what he said was correct to his knowledge (although the issue of the truthfulness of his statements
is not to be decided upon here) and secondly, he chose when to comply with the provision of information to C&E and when not to.
 The first matter suggests that the information came directly from the defendant himself as the C&E could not have had such detailed
information within their own knowledge at that stage of the investigation and secondly, he acted wholly voluntarily.  Any inducement,
if made, was not operative, as he made it clear that he refused to say that he had knowledge as to the contents of the parcel which
he maintained is what the C&E wished him to do. 19.  Accordingly, I do not find that any admissions against interest made within the VRI VDP121, have been made involuntarily.  I find
the VRI Exh VDP109, VDP121a and VDP121b prima facie admissible subject to an application as to editing matters which are either submitted to be irrelevant or where their prejudicial
effect may outweigh their probative value.","CO 9892

HKSAR v. LEE WANG KAM [2017] HKCFI 1510; HCCC 172/2016 (21 August 2017),"9.  On 9 June 2014, the Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 revised the sentencing tariffs for a person convicted of trafficking of Ice as contained in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125.  The narcotic content of Ice of 14.3 g falls within the band of 10 to 70 g where the sentence after trial ranges from 7 to 11 years’
imprisonment.  For this quantity of drugs, a starting point of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is adopted.  10.  On 2 September 2016, the Court of Appeal revised the practice of affording discounts of sentence for guilty pleas in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] HKCA 397; [2016] 5 HKLRD 1.  It was noted by the Court of Appeal that the revised practice would not apply in respect of cases in the Court of First Instance
where trial dates had already been fixed.  This case was fixed for trial on 23 May 2016 and therefore the previous practice applies.
 Under the previous practice, a defendant would usually be entitled to the normal one third discount when the plea of guilty was
entered on the first day of trial: HKSAR v Lo Chi Yip and Another [2000] HKCA 211; [2000] 3 HKLRD 270, 276C-277J; and HKSAR v Ting Chiu and Another [2003] HKCA 41; [2003] 3 HKLRD 378, [17], [21] to [23].  Accordingly, the defendant will be given the normal one third discount for his plea of guilty.  11.  The starting point of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment will therefore be reduced by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea
to 4 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearings: 27 June and 21 August 2017Date of Sentence: 21 August 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

in respect of Bankrupt’s Estate. In any event, the Son had not given any consideration for any future interest, and would not be
able to enforce such voluntary benefit made without deed against the Grantors/Trustees. 59.  For all of the above reasons, I find the TiB was correct in deciding that the Property was within the Bankrupt’s Estate. There
had been much discussion in the affirmation evidence and witness statements in relation to Wong Siu Lun’s proof of debt and/or
the TiB’s accounting inaccuracy in respect of the Estate account. I have carefully considered those matters, but they did not appear
to be relevant for the determination of the Summons. Indeed, neither the Bankrupt nor Mr Chan canvassed those matters in their submissions. 60.  In the circumstances, the Summons is dismissed. There shall be a costs order nisi that half of the costs of the Summons (including all costs reserved if any) be paid by the Bankrupt personally to the TiB to be taxed

no cogent evidence before this court that the TiB had explained the reasons for their decision in relation to the Living Trust Agreement

by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea to 5 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.  12.  Taking into account the totality principle and the circumstances of the defendant, I order that the sentence for the possession
offence run concurrently to the sentence for the trafficking offence.  I have borne in mind that the drugs found in the defendant’s
possession, had they been included in the trafficking offence would not have made a marked difference to the sentence that I would
have imposed. 13.  Accordingly, the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months.",Date of Hearing: 24 August 2017Date of Sentence: 24 August 2017,(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/1535.html,"

ME v. CYM [2017] HKCFI 1561; [2017] 4 HKLRD 739; HCMP 1624/2017 (30 August 2017),"85.  Based on my ruling on habitual residence, it is not necessary for me to consider the Article 13(b) defence.  However, I am of the
view that the evidence adduced by the Mother is not sufficient to satisfy the high threshold for such kind of defence.  Firstly,
it is also always possible for the Mother to seek proper relief from the English court, including financial relief to enable her
to stay in the UK and appropriate access arrangement.  In respect of her right to stay in the UK, I am sure that the HK Central Authority
can liaise with the English Central Authority to make temporary arrangement to enable the Mother to stay in the UK for any matrimonial
proceedings if such need arises.  Secondly, it is not sufficient for the Mother to simply assert that she does not have the means
to stay in the UK.  The facts of the present case indicate that the parties might have obtained some financial assistance from their
families.  Hence, more materials need to be supplied to the court to substantiate her allegation about the lack of means to stay
in the UK for any matrimonial proceedings.  In any event, my ruling on such defence is now academic. 86.  Based on my finding on habitual residence, I refused the Father’s application for the return of the Child.  I now make a costs
order nisi that there be no order as to costs of the present proceedings and there be legal aid taxation for the costs of both parties. Such
order shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Reasons for Judgment. 87.  I have already obtained the parties’ consent for the publication of this Reasons for Judgment.",Date of Judgment: 22 August 2017Date of Reasons for Judgment: 30 August 2017,"(David Lok)

RE Y LTD [2017] HKCFI 1716; HCCW 119/2017 (30 August 2017),"8.  It seems to me that in a case of this sort, the correct approach is for the court to be satisfied, as I am, that it is desirable
that the business is sold quickly and that in the circumstances the way in which the provisional liquidators have proceeded and the
offer that they propose to accept are within the range of reasonable procedures and price.  9.  So far as the facts of this particular application are concerned, it would in any event appear from the evidence that has been filed
that the price that the prospective purchaser has agreed to pay is right at the upper end of the range of indicative prices that
the prospective purchasers introduced by B have suggested.  Mr Maurellet SC submitted that the court should adjourn the application
in order that the provisional liquidators could allow a short period in order for alternative bids to be obtained.  There is, however,
no indication from B that there is any other prospective purchaser which is willing to pay more than the current offer, or submit
a compliant bid which would involve producing evidence of an ability to complete within the kind of time frame the provisional liquidators
require which in the sale agreement before me is within five working days of sanction by the court.  Therefore, as a matter of practicality,
not only does it seem to me to be in the interest of the continued operation of the kindergarten that the agreement is sanctioned
today, I can see no basis for thinking that adjourning the application even for a short period of time is likely to result in an
offer which is sufficiently greater than that that is currently on the table to justify the additional costs that would be incurred
in adjourning this application, or justify the possible risk of the current purchaser withdrawing its offer and the provisional liquidators
finding themselves in the position in a week’s time of having no purchaser.  10.  I will therefore make an order in substantially the terms of the summonses before me although I will make certain amendments to
the precise wording.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1716.html,"

HKSAR v. ZHANG XINHUA [2017] HKCFI 1578; HCCC 192/2017 (31 August 2017),"9.  The tariff guideline for trafficking in this quantity of Ice is set out in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691. It fixes a tariff for a narcotic content of over 600 g of Ice of 18 years’ imprisonment and upwards and further provides that for
very large quantities of over 600 g the principles laid down in HKSAR v Abdallah [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKLRD 437 should apply.  So far as material, it fixes a tariff guideline for 1,200 to 4,000 g of Ice of 23 to 26 years’ imprisonment.  10.  Based on the narcotic content of the drug of 1,920 g and the circumstances of the case, I would adopt a starting point of 23 years
and 9 months’ imprisonment which I would reduce by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea to 15 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.
 I will further reduce the sentence by 10 months because of the role played by the defendant in this crime and his cooperation with
the police at the time of his arrest as well as the view that I have taken as to his background and circumstances which led him to
commit an offence that he would not have otherwise had committed.  11.  Accordingly, the defendant is sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1578.html,"

adverse costs order.  29.  My own preference is for a robust and clear approach.  It seems to me generally that when faced with an application such as an application
for the appointment of interim receivers, the position will be that if the application is unsuccessful, the applicant will pay the
costs, and pay the costs forthwith unless it can be demonstrated that there is reason to think that at the conclusion of the proceedings,
the trial judge may be persuaded that that is an unfair order to make.  30.  In the present case, it does not seem to me that the application falls into the speculative category, although, as will be apparent

WGL v. ASB [2017] HKCFI 1700; HCMP 489/2013 (8 September 2017),"32.  As for the monthly sum of HK$4,000 for utilities, this is only an estimate on the part of the Father, and this was part of the monthly
budget of HK$60,000 for “General” expenses.  I am of the view that the proper time to deal with any variation of “General”
expenses should be at the trial. 33.  Thus, the amount the Father should pay now is HK$140,000 plus the CPI increases over the years.  I will leave the parties to work
out the exact amount.  34.  As I have indicated earlier, the Father’s application should be one for suspension, and there is no objection from Mr Chan to
treat the application as such.  The effect of my order is as follows:",(Bebe Pui Ying Chu)Judge for the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1700.html,"

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2397; HCCC 41/2016 (8 September 2017),"24.  In accordance with this Court’s ruling, the prosecution provided the following particulars in relation to the current Count 5: 25.  It is on the basis of the particulars above that the prosecution is putting its case against the 3rd defendant and to that extent the prosecution can do so. 26.  The prosecution can put their case, if this can be shown, on the basis that the explosive substances particularised in the current
Count 5 are ingredients that can make TATP but they cannot put their case on the basis that on 14 June 2015, the 3rd defendant attempted to make TATP for he has been acquitted of that offence.  In any event, he is only charged with possessing explosives.

HKSAR v. WONG KWONG WAI [2017] HKCFI 1630; [2018] 1 HKC 207; HCMA 118/2017 (11 September 2017),"3.  This charge based upon only the particulars in the charge would not have allowed the magistrate to give a proper assessment as to
sentence.  The reason being there are a wide variety of circumstances in which this offence could have been committed, for example,
it could have been a stone falling because the appellant was doing repairs outside of his home and was careless or it could have
been a stone which had fallen due to disrepair etc. It is therefore incumbent upon the prosecution to supply the court with brief
facts as to where the stone fell from, in what circumstances, and was it due to the appellant’s negligence or did the incident
happen due to a lack of supervision or care.  Also of particular importance was the size of the stone and whether it had fallen from
the balcony of the appellant’s apartment, the window or the wall etc. 4.  Hence, it is of the utmost importance that this absence of brief facts is an isolated incident and hopefully both the prosecution,
the police and the court will be vigilant to stop this from happening again. 5.  In the circumstances I allowed the appellant to appeal against his conviction out of time and set aside his conviction due to the
absence of facts upon which to base his conviction.  His sentence was also set aside.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1630.html,"

The parties do not seem to appreciate that there is such a final stage mentioned in Rambas Marketing Co., LLC v Chow Kam Fai, David, supra.  In any event, in view of my finding in Stage (I), it is also not necessary for me to consider this final stage. 70.  By reasons aforesaid, I do not find any valid ground to support the defendant’s application for the declaration or stay sought
in the defendant’s summons dated 21 March 2016. 71.  I therefore order as follows: -",Date of Handing Down of Decision: 11 September 2017(Michael Wong),Master of the High Court,/2017/1632.html,"

TSOI CHIK SANG LAWRENCE AND OTHERS v. TASTY CATERING GROUP LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1637; HCMP 812/2017 (12 September 2017),"93.  On the evidence adduced, this case cries out for the appointment of receivers.  First and foremost, the absence of a properly constituted
board of a company that is actively trading alone would be sufficient reason.  The shareholder dispute (which is unlikely to be resolved
in the near future) creates an insuperable obstacle in the way of resolving the problem by convening a meeting of members to appoint
the directors.  Meanwhile, HHCS continues to be in breach of its statutory obligations that are criminal offences, a state of affairs
that should not be allowed to continue.   94.  The practical solution lies in the appointment of receivers.  It would enable applications to be made for a meeting to be held limited
to the presentation of financial statements, director’s reports etc to meet the statutory obligations. 95.  In my view, when that is coupled with uncertainty over share capital, the possibility of dilution having taken place and jeopardy
to HHCS’s assets, the case for the exercise of the court’s discretion was overwhelming.  The respondents have not been able to
put forward any good reason for not making the appointment that would outweigh those considerations.  In the circumstances, the court
had no hesitation in making the appointment.",(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1637.html,"

Mr Haynes lists his specific objections to the individual materials in paragraph 4 of his written grounds of objection. 33.  During the course of submissions when dealing with the objections to various exhibits, a number of proposed exhibits had been removed
by the prosecution.  I must say that the exercise of examining the relevance of these materials has been extremely difficult because
of the confusing nature and changing position of the prosecution case, and the recent flow of additional evidence that the prosecution
wish to rely on at trial.  In respect of the following remaining exhibits, I have set out my remarks concerning the nature and relevance
of the exhibit in question and whether to allow or disallow its admission into evidence.  34.  I should point out that a significant portion of the objected material concerns discussions or meetings of a group or individuals
in relation to demonstrations and political activities.  There are at times comments about tactics and actions to be employed at
public events or directed to identified targets.  In light of the charges that have been laid against the defendants and the prosecution
case summary, it is unclear as to the relevance of this material.  It is on that basis that I have disallowed the material that falls

no application has been taken out by the Defendants to discharge the injunction order for material non-disclosure.  At the inter parte hearing before Lok J, the Defendants were represented.  No complaint about non-disclosure was raised.  Three months later, the Defendants
took out an application for variation of the injunction.  Again, no application to discharge the injunction order was made.  This
application was only raised by Mr Ko in his skeleton argument dated 25 May 2017 for hearing on 29 May 2017.  The application has
not been properly made.  The Plaintiff has no opportunity of filing evidence in opposition.  It would be unfair and prejudicial to
the Plaintiff if I should allow this application to be heard.  I refused to allow this court to be hi-jacked into hearing this un-scheduled
application. 77.  As mentioned above, back on 23 January 2017, the Defendants took out a summons seeking to vary the terms of the injunction order
on account of legal costs to be incurred by them.  The application was heard before Deputy High Court Judge Hunsworth on 27 January
2017 and was adjourned sine die with liberty to restore and with costs to the Plaintiff.  Yet, to date, the Defendants have not sought to restore the application
for hearing.  Now, through counsel’s skeleton submission, the Defendants seek to vary the terms of the injunction order to the
extent that it does not prohibit each of the Defendants from spending $10,000 per week towards its ordinary and proper business expenses
and does not prohibit them collectively spending a total of $200,000 per month on legal advice and representation subject to a maximum
of $1,600,000.  As the application has not been restored, no evidence has been filed and, more importantly, summary judgment having
been entered against the Defendants, I see no reason or purpose in granting the variation.  The application is dismissed. 78.  For all these reasons, summary judgment is entered against all the Defendants; the Plaintiff’s summons seeking leave to file the
affirmationof Lakhani is allowed; and the injunction order is continued until furtherorder.  The Defendants’ application to discharge
the injunction order or to vary its terms by way of counsel’s skeleton submission is refused.  I also make a costs order nisi that the Defendants shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs.",Date of Decision: 14 September 2017( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1654.html,"

Mr Lam SC argued that a duty to correct any error in the accounts arose from section 123 of the then Companies Ordinance, Cap 32, and section 373 of Cap 622 which replaced it.  These, however, are not duties owed to individual shareholders.  However I accept that the failure

statements for the three years, 2005 to 2007, which record in the notes the relevant sums as owed by YK Yung to the Company.  Mr
Yung signed those three sets of financial statements. Even assuming that YK Yung’s characterisation of the payments was proved

treatment and sums as due from him to the Company, there is any basis for saying that it was unfair in June 2015 for Plastics’

ALAN CHUNG WAH TANG AND ANOTHER v. LEE SIU FONG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1676; HCB 345/2001 (21 September 2017),"28.  It seems to me that Mr Siu was correct in submitting, on behalf of the trustees, that it is premature at this stage to speculate
what causes of action there may be against which persons, and that in an application for private examination the trustees need not
formulate a cause of action.  If a person is shown to be holding pre-bankruptcy assets for the bankrupt, an action by the trustees
(in whom all such assets have vested) might be an action to recover trust property and might be free from limitation (see also §27
of the 2016 Reasons). 29.  Lastly, the Sisters allege that the trustees have acted for an ulterior motive, in that they are making these applications under
s 29 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance in order to get remuneration for themselves through the costs of these applications.  The allegation is premised on the contention
that there is no viable action that could be brought which could achieve any recovery for the benefit of the creditors.  As I have
stated, this is at best speculative at this stage. In any event, I do not think there is any sufficient basis to raise the inference
sought.  It is unnecessary to deal with the argument whether a trustee’s own fees can be recovered as part of the costs of a contested
application such as this. 30.  For the above reasons, there will be an order for the private examination of the Sisters, subject to the qualification mentioned
in §§7, 17 and 26 above.  The examination is to take place before a master of the High Court.  On a nisi basis, I order that the costs of and relating to the trustees’ summons be paid forthwith by the Sisters to the trustees, to be

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. CHENG MEI LING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1686; HCMP 1825/2016 (21 September 2017),"51.  I have previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Kwan JA in Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 in which the court concluded that if there is not sufficient evidence of constructive notice, it is unnecessary to consider if a
bank has taken reasonable steps to dispel constructive notice. 52.  While Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 was a matter that went to trial, I have also previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Mr Justice Ng in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015, a matter decided on a summary basis, in which His Lordship rejected a defence of undue influence which he found was
based on bare assertions which were not believable, lacked precision or particulars and did not show the defendant has been “…
forced, tricked or misled …” into signing the subject documentation.  As I have observed, every such case is very much dependent on its own facts, but I would
echo what His Lordship said in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015. 53.  After considering all of the evidence and the circumstances, for the reasons set out in my judgment I do not view the evidence of
the 1st defendant that she only entered into the Plaintiff’s Mortgage due to the undue influence of the 5th defendant as believable and therefore giving rise to triable issues which might amount to a credible defence.  Accordingly, I refuse
the application of the 1st defendant that the plaintiff’s Originating Summons be continued as if begun by writ or alternatively that it be heard (wholly or
in part) on oral evidence and therefore I give judgment for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s counsel provided a draft order to the
court for the hearing on 6 July 2017.  I make an order nisi in the terms of the said draft on terms that if any party seeks a variation to the draft they shall apply within 14 days of the date
of handing down of judgment by letter to my clerk setting out the variation they seek.  However, I would encourage the parties to
first seek to agree the terms of a draft order and if agreed jointly submit a draft for approval.","CHENG TUN HUM

resulting from the wrongful granting of the Injunction Order. 35.  After the hearing, the 1st and 2nd Defendants through their solicitors write to the court indicating they would not proceed with the inquiry for the Default Payment

BUILDING AUTHORITY v. APPEAL TRIBUNAL (BUILDINGS) [2017] HKCFI 1698; HCAL 11/2014 (25 September 2017),"18.  It is in those special circumstances that the court found it just to make the costs order requiring only the 100th interested to bear the costs of the applicant in the judicial review after he was granted legal aid and actively participated in the proceedings.  There are no similar considerations in the present case. 19.  Second, short of what could be properly regarded as public interest litigation[1] (which is clearly not the case here), the fact that the Church in pursuing the redevelopment plan (which led to the appeal before
the Tribunal and hence the judicial review) is pursing some form of public service and interest alone cannot generally be regarded as a compelling reason to reduce or avoid its costs liability in resisting a successful challenge of an administrative
decision.  Otherwise, almost all public authority respondents in failing to resist a successful judicial review would not be required
to bear the costs or the full costs of the successful applicant in a judicial review, which cannot be right as a matter of general
principle.  See: Ming Pao, supra, paragraph 4. 20.  For all the above reasons, I am not persuaded that I should vary the costs order nisi to the extent as submitted by the Church.  I would therefore dismiss the costs variation application, and the costs order nisi shall hereby become absolute.  The costs of this variation application shall form part of the costs of the judicial review.",(Thomas Au)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1698.html,"

 The evidence of Mr Yeung and Mr Wong on the other hand is reasonable and credible.  Save and except the parts that I have accepted
above, I reject the evidence of Mr Au-Yeung and Mr Chau whenever it is in conflict with the evidence of Mr Yeung and Mr Wong. 269.  I have given judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of HK$1,197,191.  I also order that interest on the judgment to the plaintiff

HKSAR v. MCCALL HOWARD KENNETH AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2428; [2018] 3 HKC 61; HCCC 446/2016 (25 September 2017),"43.  The constitutional right at stake in the instant case is the inviolability of a person’s home or other premises.  The issue here
is not simply privacy rights.  I have attempted to outline the importance of that right in earlier passages of this judgment.  It
is a right which is not absolute and an intrusion on such rights which is arbitrary or not lawful should be viewed with seriousness.
 The authorities cited above clearly support the proposition that in granting a search warrant which would render lawful an intrusion
into the rights guaranteed under Article 29 of the Basic Law must take into account that the grant of such a warrant would be such
an intrusion.  The warrantless search formerly permitted under section 52(1)(e) has now been narrowed so as to permit this if, and
only if, the obtaining of a warrant under section 52(1E) is not reasonably practicable.  That too underlines importance that the
legislature accords to the rights of the nature of those guaranteed under Article 29.  The respect due to this right is, in my view,
of the utmost importance.  Nevertheless, in the specific circumstancesof this case it seems to me that the reception into evidence
of the product of the searches of both premises is conducive to a fair trial and most assuredly would not place in jeopardy a fair
trial.  The evidence is both important and cogent and would, for all practical purposes bring to an end the trial of Counts 2 and
3 on the indictment.[23]  Speaking generally and applying the proposition specifically to this set of circumstances, the attempt to fight against the unlawful
trafficking of dangerous drugs is a matter of the highest importance.  In this case, the product of the searches reveals a very serious
case.  Although it is inappropriate at this stage to start looking at the quantum of any sentence that the accused might receive
on conviction for the 2nd and 3rd counts on the indictment and, in particular, the 3rd count, such a sentence would be very substantial and would reflect the serious view that the community of Hong Kong takes with respect
to the unlawful trafficking of substantial quantities of dangerous drugs — particularly of the kind of drugs involved here.  On
any view, this is a serious case.  In my opinion, had I been of the view that the search of the 2 premises had been unlawful and
not justified by section 52(1)(e) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, I would not have hesitated to hold that the breach in the specific circumstances of this case is anything other than reconcilable
withthe respect due to the right or rights concerned. 44. The final issue arising from HKSAR ‍v ‍Muhammad Riaz Khan (above) that needs to be  considered in this context is whether a ‍ruling in favour of the  prosecution appears unlikely to encourage
any future breaches of the rights at issue.  In my ‍judgement, the unique circumstances  of this case, where one ‍arm of the
police (the Mong Kok SDS team) was doing  its job in an ‍apparently perfectly appropriate and professional way[24] and unbeknownst to the Mong Kok SDS team another arm of the police (the Narcotics Bureau) was doing an apparently perfectly appropriate
and professional job in terms of the detection of crime but, as I have held, fell down in relation to how it dealt with search warrants
and unintentionally left the Mong Kok SDS team in a position where the obtaining of a search warrant under section 52(1E) was not reasonably practicable, I think that this alone would demonstrate that such ruling of this Court in the present circumstances
would be unlikely to encourage any future breaches of this kind.  I hasten to add in this context that the officers of the Narcotics
Bureau in not applying for a fresh warrant or applying to renew the existing warrant were not acting in any form of bad faith.  They
simply got the law wrong.  Further, I would be extremely surprised if the law enforcement agencies have not reviewed their practices
in the light of the decision in Keen Lloyd & Ors v Commissioner of Customs and Excise & Department of Justice (above) and there are in place practices and procedures to minimise the risk of future breaches of the rights involved in this case
on the basis of a stale warrant. 45.  For these reasons, I order that the product of the searches of both the Hennessy Road and Canal Road West premises is admissible
against the 1st Accused.  While parties to these proceedings should be permitted to see these reasons for my decision without delay, I think it is
inappropriate and potentially not conducive to a fair trial for there to be any publicity which refers to the degree to which the
police (in this context, I refer to the police as a whole) considered the 1st Accused to be a target for their interest in connection with trafficking in dangerous drugs.  Thus, while I will provide the reasons
for my decision to the parties, I direct that the reasons should not otherwise be published until the conclusion of the trial or
further order.","LAM AROON

of junior counsel.  I bear in mind the complexity of the case, especially in terms of the contrasting factual versions relied on
by the parties, as well as the value of the convertible bond and the importance of the case to the 1st Defendant.  The absolute figure claimed is, in my experience, not unreasonable even though it was exclusive of further drafting or
settling of documents, consultations and conferences.  I will stick to my original ruling. 61.  I have only revised my ruling in respect of items 32, 46, 70.1-70.7 and 76 of Section A.  The net result is to deduct a further
8.25 hours from the time costs of Mr Tse, at the rate of $4,300/hour. 62.  Both sides have succeeded partly in their applications for review.  Although there have been revisions in respect of the costs allowed
for the aforesaid four sets of items, the change in the overall position is not substantial when compared to the size of the Bill.

LAERDAL MEDICAL LTD v. HONG KONG HAOCHENG INTERNATIONAL TRADE LTD [2017] HKCFI 1742; HCA 2193/2016 (26 September 2017),"9.  Apart from the prospect of success of the proposed appeal, I also have regard to the circumstances of the present case.  The real
dispute is about the money still remaining in D’s bank account.  Apart from that money, D does not have other assets in Hong Kong
to satisfy the Judgment.  I am told that D’s bank account has in effect been “frozen” by the Police by means of a “letter
of no consent” which is purely an administrative measure.The reality is that if that letter is not withdrawn, then even if a stay
of execution was ordered, D would be unlikely to be able to move any money out of that bank account.  On the other hand, if the Police
was minded to withdraw the “letter of no intent”, there would be nothing to prevent P from taking out a post-judgment Mareva injunction in order to preserve the assets.  Besides, in my assessment there is not a risk that D’s appeal would be rendered nugatory
if no stay was ordered.  This is because P’s solicitors have agreed to stake-hold all money derived from the execution of the Judgment
against D pending the disposal of the appeal.  Moreover, a business associate of P in Hong Kong has also offered to give an undertaking
to court that it will repay D in the event of a successful appeal.  There is no reason for me to doubt the sufficiency and adequacy
of the aforesaid undertakings.  On the other hand, D does not have substantial ties with Hong Kong and if it was allowed to remove
any money out of its bank account, the likelihood of P being able to execute its Judgment in case D’s appeal failed would be remote. 10.  In all the circumstances, given the undertakings from P, I see no good reasons why P should not have the fruits of its Judgment
now.  Therefore, I refuse D’s application for stay of execution.  11.  I will hear counsel on costs.",Date of Judgment: 26 September 2017(Alex Lee),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1742.html,"

Based on the above, I make the following order in favour of the plaintiffs: 32.  The administration and distribution of the estate would be a matter for the administrators.  However, the parties and the persons
who are going to administer the Deceased’s estate will note my comments about the operation of s 10(1) of the Wills Ordinance regarding any disposition of property to P2. 33.  I note that the defendants do not actively oppose the deem execution of the 1997 will and the rectification of P1’s name in that
will.  On the other hand, they have not given their consent either.  There is therefore a necessity to have a hearing on those issues.
 D1 in effect objects to the passing over, although he says in court that he does not object to the appointment of independent person
as administrator to administer the Deceased estate together with him.  D2 and D3 support the plaintiff’s application for passing
over.  The issue of passing over occupied much of the court’s time spent.  Having regards to the issues in dispute, the respective
stances taken by the parties and the result of the case, I make an order nisi that D1 is to pay three-fourth of the plaintiffs’ costs and D2 and D3 are jointly to pay one‑fourth of the plaintiff’s costs,

With regard to contempt of court, neither counsel developed submissions on the point.  Moreover, I consider such a serious allegation
is one in respect of which the parties should have the opportunity to provide evidence.  There was no such opportunity.  For these
reasons, I decline to make an order for indemnity costs. 21.  With regard to the submission that the defendant is making oppressive, frivolous and vexatious applications, I do not think the
defendant’s conduct can be characterized as such at this stage.  The defendant’s appeal against the Master’s orders succeeded.
 Applications for costs to be taxed and paid forthwith are quite commonplace and the result is a matter for a court’s discretion.
 With regard to the defendant’s particular applications, the manner in which they were conducted was not oppressive and they were
supported by considered submissions; they were not frivolous or vexatious.  I make the same observation in respect of the application

With regard to Mr Koo’s last point of limitation, I have doubt whether s. 4 of the Limitation Ordinance can apply to a claim for retransfer of land based on resulting trust.  In any case, the claim does not arise unless and until the
plaintiff has withdrawn from the illegal agreements.  I cannot see how the plaintiff can maintain his involvement in the illegality
and at the same time seek retransfer of the property in question.  Hence, the cause of action only arose upon withdrawal from the
agreements.  This ground of objection thus has no merit. 63.  Though Mr Koo has not raised this question, I would also advert to it.  This action was started in 2007.  But 2nd defendant’s listing questionnaire filed on 10 February 2017 still said that it was not appropriate to set the case down for trial.
 Furthermore, the development cannot proceed further because the District Lands Office will not issue any more building licence for
the lots as a result of the plaintiff’s complaint.  The situation is thus in a deadlock.  There is no pressing need for the actin
to be disposed of.  I have also observed that the new cause of action based on illegality may assume core importance in this action.
 Hence, delay is not a factor against the granting leave to re-amend the statement of claim. 64.  I will grant leave to the plaintiff to effect the proposed re-amendments with consequential directions and costs order.  However,
I would give the plaintiff one more opportunity to consider and advise me no later than 6 October 2017 on whether he would have further
revisions to make to the draft re-amendments to take into account of the development of the law in Patel v Mirza and if so, when the revisions will be ready.",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1735.html,"

so.  There is nothing inherent in the Defendant’s case, and there is no basis for the court to disturb the primary findings of
fact made by the Presiding Officer. 55.  Finally, Mr Kwok also raises a procedural challenge in respect of the evidence given by Madam Tsui of the Defendant.  He refers
to an incident that occurred during the trial on 9 July 2015.  According to Mr Kwok, the Presiding Officer should have disallowed
part of Ms Tsui evidence because a trainee solicitor hired by the Defendant was feeding the answers to her.  However, the Presiding
Officer had dealt with such complaint in the Decision.  She had already rejected Madam Tsui’s evidence given in the morning of
9 July 2015 and accorded very little weight to the rest of her evidence.[25]  Hence, such procedural challenge simply has no merit at all. 56.  For the above reasons, the Presiding Officer was entitled to make the finding that the Claimant was not working as an employee of

"SHI, THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF YANG FEND, DECEASED v. DR LAM MAN HO [2017] HKCFI 2420; HCPI 128/2013 (6 October 2017)","1.  On 23 February 2016, Master Leong ordered the plaintiff to pay further security for costs into court to cover the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants’ costs, and also the 4th defendant’s costs, up to the determination of the issue of split trial. As matters progressed, the assessment of the security for
costs fell to me. The learned master had previously ordered the plaintiff to pay security for costs to cover the defendants’ costs
up to the exchange of witness statements and which had been paid by the plaintiff into court. This is my assessment of the quantum
of the security that ought to be provided to cover these further costs up to the determination of the issue of split trial. 2.  I deal first with 4th defendants’ claim for security for costs and do so by utilising the helpful table prepared by the 4th defendant’s solicitors.  I shall then deal with the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants’ claim for security for costs and also do so by utilising the helpful table prepared by their solicitors. 3.  I order the plaintiff to pay further security for costs into court in the sum of $600,000 to cover the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants’ costs up to the determination of the issue of split trial.  I also order the plaintiff to pay further security for
costs into court in the sum of $300,000 to cover the 4th defendant’s costs up to the determination of the issue of split trial. I direct the parties to submit an agreed draft order for
my approval.","Total suggested amount

HKSAR v. OSINAGA BANEGAS MARIA ISABEL [2017] HKCFI 1757; HCCC 219/2017 (9 October 2017),"27.  It seems to me that a defendant’s participation in the campaign is a reflection of his genuine remorse for the crime that he has
committed and desire to assist the authorities to prevent others from making the same mistake.  It is the display of remorse and
cooperativeness with the authorities that a sentencing court can recognise within its sentencing discretion.  To this end, it needs
to be established on evidence that the defendant has genuinely participated in the campaign, and that the participation has been
positive and substantial.  28.  As I have already indicated, the narcotic content of cocaine in the present case warrants a starting point of 24 years’ imprisonment.
There is an international element involved in this offence because the defendant was importing drugs into Hong Kong.  The sentencing
guidelines provide that an international element is an aggravating factor calling for the enhancement of the starting point where
for amounts above 1 kg should not be less than 2 years’ imprisonment.  Accordingly, the starting point is enhanced by 2 years to
26 years’ imprisonment.  As I have stated I will reduce her sentence by 9 months for her genuine, and positive and substantial
participation in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign which will result in a starting point of 25 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.
 29.  As the defendant is entitled to a one third discount for her plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, the defendant is therefore
sentenced to 16 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1757.html,"

appropriate for the seriousness of this case.  I reduce it to $300,000. 40.  As Wong adopted a negative role in complying with the disclosure order by leaving it to Tang to perform, what I have said about
Tang applies equally to her.  This is because the duty of disclosure is a non‑delegable one.  Having regard to her passive role,
her personal circumstances and the fact that she has retired, I consider a lower starting point of $300,000 appropriate and reduce

is that the debts under both the first part and the second part of proviso (i) are deductible.  There is nothing to indicate that
debts which were included as trading receipts in ascertaining the profits must also, in the case of a money lender, have been lent
in the ordinary course of the business of the lending of money.  There is no reason in justice to deny a money lender the right to
make a deduction where, as in this case, interest income not actually received had been taxed on an accrual basis when it can be
shown that such interest was unlikely actually to be received, merely because the loan was not lent in the ordinary course of the
business of the lending of money.  36.  Ground 12, like Ground 1, is no more than a general assertion, questioning the ultimate conclusion of the Board without identifying
any specific legal error or question.  It adds nothing and raises no proper question of law.  37.  For the above reasons, the application for leave to appeal is dismissed.

I have to say, in fairness to the 3rd Defendant, that I understand that the orders have not been served on it. 3.  The evidence before the court is quite disturbing. It appears that there is a concerted effort by various parties to try to hide
from the court, and thereby frustrating the disclosure orders, as to the whereabouts of the LaFerrari.  With respect, the alleged
sale or re-sale of the LaFerrari is, on the available evidence, difficult to believe due to, inter alia, the vast undervalue at which
it was purportedly sold and re-sold.  There is clearly urgency in the matter, which was accepted by DHCJ Keith and DHCJ Francis.
The urgency remains.  In particular, the property has still not been located and the orders which were made by the court have been
frustrated.   4.  In these circumstances, there is justification for making a further disclosure order as requested by the Plaintiff.  Hence, I have

He said, and it is trite, that the provisions governing that release must be both easy to understand and apply.  The regulations
applicable to them and their application must be transparent.  I find the core principles as applicable to the issues before me today
to be as follows: 20.  The appellant is to serve 22 months in total for the five charges which he faced under TMCC 2032.  The period of custody or detention
to be deducted from that sentence is to be 40 days representing 25 and 26 July 2016 and 26 November 2016 to 2 January 2017 as confirmed
by the Correctional Services Department.  All other periods of detention or custody have been credited elsewhere. 21.  The appellant has not been prejudiced by the fact that he was sentenced separately under STCC 5298 and TMCC 2032 and all relevant
periods of custody or detention have been taken into account.  Accordingly, this appeal against sentence is dismissed.",(A P Campbell Moffat)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1865.html,"

if the documents have not already been included by the respondents in either their original list of documents or supplemental list.
 However, as the categories are divided in such a way in the summonses so that category 4 refers to payment slips, bank slips, bank
statements in relation to funds withdrawn from the Companies and paid to Madam Lai, in order for any argument about what the order
intends, I will order that the respondents make an affirmation verifying a list of documents in respect of all accounting records,
including vouchers, invoices, receipts, payment slips, and instructions of whatever nature to any bank with which any of the Companies
have an account, of deposits and withdrawals for the period 1 January 2016 to 30 April 2016.  15.  The petitioner has been successful in obtaining an order for further discovery, but the ambit of the order is far narrower than
that sought in the summonses.  It does seem to me that if the application had been restricted to something roughly in line with what
I have ordered, it would be possible to have been either agreed it in entirety or the difference between the parties would have been
very narrow.  Certainly it seems to me that a hearing which resulted in a bundle of in excess of 10 files and a hearing which lasted
a whole day would not have been necessary. It seems to me in the circumstances it is appropriate to apportion the costs.  16.  I will therefore order that the respondents pay 20% of the petitioner’s costs with a certificate for two counsel.","Samdor Company Limited

is excepted from the definition of “meeting” in section 2(1) as being a “gathering or assembly of persons convened or organized exclusively … as a conference or seminar bona fide intended
for the discussion of topics of a … professional, business … character.”  Had it been necessary to do so, I would have considered
it reasonably arguable that this exception does not, or may not, apply to the Special Meeting having regard to the purpose of the
meeting, the identity of the persons being invited to attend the meeting, the matters discussed at the meeting, the conduct of the
participants at the meeting, as well as the resolution passed at the meeting. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, the applications for leave to amend or re-amend the Form 86, as well as the application for leave to
apply for judicial review, are dismissed. Where an application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed on the ground
that the applicant has no standing to make the application, it may properly be regarded as an abuse of the court’s process.  Taking
into account also the lack of merits in the proposed challenge and the substantial assistance that the court has received from the
putative respondents (including the evidence filed on their behalf), I consider that the putative respondents ought to be entitled
to the costs of resisting the various applications (including costs previously reserved), to be taxed if not agreed with certificate

materials normally put before it by those who have been appointed to administer the estate and who ought to be in a good position
to provide such information and materials.  In the present case, I consider the plaintiffs have wholly failed to make any real attempt
to justify the estimated costs or potential liabilities of the estate of the Deceased.  The plaintiffs’ estimated total figure
of around HK$125 million, as well as the individual estimated sums, are, in my view, unreliable.  Distribution of the estate of the
Deceased is long overdue, being in mind that the Deceased passed away more than 13 years ago and probate was granted to the Executrices
more than 11 years ago.  Doing the best that I can on the information and materials before me and taking a broad view of the situation,
I consider that a reserve of HK$50 million should be ample to provide for the potential costs and liabilities of the estate in respect
of the items referred by Mr Wong.  Taking into account also Mr Leung’s submission that the cash in the RMB account may not be readily
realizable, I consider that an interim distribution of HK$88 million ought to be made to the beneficiaries of the estate of the Deceased. 13.  For the foregoing reasons, I direct the Executrices to make a further interim distribution of HK$88 million to the beneficiaries
of the estate of the Deceased. 14.  I reserve the question of costs, which shall be dealt with at the hearing of the rest of the claim and counterclaim in this action.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1864.html,"

raise any triable issue.  Besides, Lau is the holder and signatory of these accounts.  He did not even plead or adduce evidence of
the correct amount according to these accounts.  He merely put the Plaintiff to strict proof and dressed up the dispute as a triable
issue.  His disputes about these amounts are not made bona fide and raised no triable issue at all.  54.  There are other issues which Mr Chan argued were triable.  I have considered them but do not find it necessary to specifically deal
with them.  They are frivolous and have no bearing on the Plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. 55.  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that this is a case suitable for summary judgment.  I am also satisfied that the Defendant
has not shown any credible defence or raised any triable issue.  Accordingly, I enter judgment for the Plaintiff in the amount of
US$24,180,000 with interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the rate of 1% per month from 27 July 2012 under the date of issue
of the writ and 1% above prime rate from that date until the date of this judgment and thereafter at judgment rate until payment.
There shall also be a costs order nisi that the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs on party and party basis, to be taxed, if not agreed.","DOMINIC TAK MING LAU

"MESSRS BRUNO ARBOIT AND IAN ROBINSON, THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHUNG YING REMINBI EXCHANGE CO LTD (IN COMPULSORY LIQUIDATION) v. HU YAN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1898; [2017] 5 HKLRD 768; HCA 2401/2015 (26 October 2017)","43.  As for Mr Chan SC’s argument based on the use of the word “misappropriated” in paragraph 8 of the statement of claim, I think
he was quoting the word out of context.  I have mentioned in paragraph 28 above that the word “misappropriated” as used in the
statement of claim is not to be understood in its technical sense.  It merely referred to the act or omission of not handing over
the Sum pursuant to their duty as director or employee of the Company.  The Plaintiff’s cause of action is conversion, which is
a tort of strict liability.  The intention of the defendant in relation to the claimant is of no significance. The claimant does
not have to prove dishonesty.  The defendant’s honest and reasonable belief that he was entitled to exercise possessory right over
the subject matter of conversion is also irrelevant.  Given this context in which the word was used, it is impossible to infer any
allegation of fraud or dishonesty.  As was held by the Court of Appeal in Menfond Electronic Art & Computer & Design Co Ltd v Wong Wang Tat Victor [26], the court should not infer the making of an allegation of deliberate dishonesty too liberally, it should not put a spin of deliberate
dishonesty on an alleged act or omission simply because the plaintiff said it was wrongful on his version of event.  What Mr Chan
SC was seeking to do was to put that spin of deliberate dishonesty on the word “misappropriated” by quoting it out of context.
 This is just a simple case, involving simple facts which left no room for any argument of the “fraud exception”. 44.  Mr Hughes suggested seeking the court’s indulgence to amend the statement of claim by deleting the word “misappropriated”.
 I do not consider that necessary.  The meaning of that word in its proper context is so clear that it is incapable of being misunderstood. 45.  For the above reasons, I find that the Plaintiff have made out a prima facie case that they are entitled to judgment, and that the Defendants have failed to show any bona fide defence or raise any triable issue.  Though some of the Contracts had been performed by the Company paying Zhou about 58% of the
amount due, the entire Sum was shown to have been converted.  While there is no doubt that the Company performed some of those Contracts
using its own funds, it does not necessary mean those funds came from part of the Sum.  It would have been appropriate to enter judgment
for the entire Sum.  However, I would err in favour of the Defendants and adopt the same generous course taken by the master, ie
to enter summary judgment to the extent of the outstanding amount of the Sum which the Company had failed to pay Zhou and to give
unconditional leave to defend the balance.  I therefore uphold the master’s decision and dismiss the appeal with costs.",Date of Decision: 26 October 2017( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1898.html,"

YAU KA HANG v. COMPANIES REGISTRY [2017] HKCFI 2076; HCMP 1819/2017 (26 October 2017),"4.  I think that in this kind of case one has to take a robust commonsense view.  Mr Yau clearly appears to this court to have an interest
in the matter.  Without going into the details of the Road Traffic Ordinance, it is clear to me that without a restoration order, Mr Yau will not be able to get the car registered in his name because the transfer
of ownership took place on a date after the dissolution of the company. 5.  If a restoration order is given, by virtue of s 768(1) the company is to be regarded as having continued in existence as if it had
not been dissolved.  It may be that that is sufficient to enable Mr Yau to get registered as the new owner, but even if the expiry
of registration since 2013 is a problem and further steps have to be taken in the name of the company, it seems to me that Mr Yau
needs the restoration order to be able to deal with the problem effectively.  6.  In these circumstances, I consider it just that the company be restored to the Companies Register and there will be an order accordingly.","COMPANIES REGISTRY

of mediation seeks to achieve that.  Courts know that takes place but is wholly unaware of what is said or done under its umbrella.
 This mere reference to such a “without prejudice meeting” has no effect upon a court so the exclusion in principle of it is
in fact immaterial.  However, Mr Horace Wong SC declined the invitation despite his very general approach that nothing must be known
of any such meeting, but saying the reference to such a meeting was prejudicial even though he effectively conceded that there was
no prejudicial content in the letter. 22.  How essential the contents of the letter are to the plaintiffs’ case is not for me to assess.  If it does not carry the plaintiff’s
case any further, for example, by showing some inconsistency in the case advanced by the defendant, then it may be superfluous. 23.  This application is dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.","andTHE CLEARWATER BAY GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB

of the award or judgment against him could not be regarded as evidence of a risk of dissipation of assets.  What is stated in the
Report is, essentially, clearer or more detailed evidence that the respondent and DNK failed to cooperate in the execution process
against them, but the nature of the allegation against the respondent remains the same.  It seems clear that the respondent and DNK
are not willing to voluntarily pay the sums which they have been ordered to pay to the applicant under the Award, but I do not consider
that to be “solid evidence” of a risk of dissipation of assets for the purpose of granting a Mareva injunction. 18.

HKSAR v. YIM SHEK WO [2017] HKCFI 2424; HCCC 164/2017 (27 October 2017),"44.  If the Accused had continued to have the difficulties which he manifested for some minutes at the customs area at Sha Tau Kok then
there might have been a real issue as to the fitness of the Accused which might have presented issues in connection with the voluntariness
of the admissions against interest made by the Accused in the sense that it may have been oppressive to continue to ask questions
of him which produced admissible material.  It may have been an issue for the exercise of the discretion of the court to exclude
otherwise admissible material on the usual criteria.  However, there was nothing in the CCTV or in the video recorded interview or
in the testimony of the police officers (which I accept) which caused me concern in relation to the various issues of admissibility
that might have otherwise arisen.  That the Accused may not have been in perfect condition is not to the point.  The issues that
arose in relation to the health of the Accused were not such at the time that he made the various admissions attributed to him to
have rendered those admissions involuntary.  Further, on no account could those admissions, specifically at the times they were made,
be excluded on the basis of an exercise of the court’s discretion. 45.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the testimony of the officers in rejecting the allegations of threats and inducements.
 I am satisfied the same standard that the health issues which manifested themselves at a particular point in time were such that
at the time that the admissions attributed to the Accused were made that they caused any basis for doubting the voluntariness of
those admissions.  There was nothing in the condition of the Accused which could possibly have justified the exclusion of the admissions
attributed to the Accused on the basis of an exercise of the discretion of the court. 46.  For those reasons, I admitted the impugned admissions.",Date of Reasons for Ruling: 27 October 2017(Andrew Bruce SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2424.html,"

CHU KONG v. LAU WING YAN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1916; HCA 226/2017 (30 October 2017),"23.  The applicant’s position is that as it has received full payment of the balance of the purchase price from D2, it would be prejudiced
if the court were to grant the declaration sought against it in the action which would involve the balance of the purchase price
having to be returned. 24.  Assuming that the supplemental agreement is held to be void, it does not follow that the applicant would necessarily suffer any
prejudice because for one thing the company must still perform the Contract by paying the balance of the purchase price to the applicant.
 In any event, it is no more than a possible consequence of a successful claim against D1 – D3.  It is hardly conceivable that
the relief the court would consider appropriate would not ensure that the effect on the applicant would be neutral. 25.  For those reasons, I have no hesitation in dismissing the summons.

there was no evidence of association between D4 and the defendants except for the outing on 27 and 28 May 2015 and his attendance
at electronic courses together with D3 and D5.  He further pointed out that D4 had no contact or involvement with the relevant defendants
in relation to the events on 14 June 2015.  He challenged the evidence of PW3 and PW4 and noted that Superintendent Roberts (PW34),
was unsure in his expert opinion about the observations of the police officers on 28 May 2015.  The various points and issues that
he has raised are matters for the jury to consider and determine.  42.  Mr Keith Fung, for D5, in oral submissions submitted that apart from the admissions made by D5 in the two VRIs and the video reconstruction,
there was no evidence of association between D5 and the others and nothing incriminating was found at his home when searched by the
police.  He sought to rely on the inconsistencies of D5’s answers in his caution statements but it would appear that there are
admissions contained in them that the prosecution can rely on in relation to Count 1.  43.  The matters raised by counsel for the defendants in their no case submissions do not justify taking the case away from the jury.
 There is in my view a case to answer against each of the defendants on the counts that they respectively face.  The matters that

Vehicle (or Licence) is still in the hands of Mr Chin.  I am not prepared to exercise my discretion to grant an injunction in such

Yam’s decision not to pursue the application for a Mareva injunction, the proposed injunction was still appropriate.  Mr Wong maintained that it was still appropriate for the proprietary
injunction sought, but said that Mr Yam would be happy to abide by such amendments to the draft order as might be made by the court.
 As I informed Mr Wong, it was not for the court to draft an appropriate form of the injunction for his client.  This ought to be
so, particularly where Mr Yam was fully represented by counsel and solicitor whereas Mr Chin was absent at the hearing.  Mr Wong
did not put forward any revised draft order for the court’s consideration.  In the circumstances, Mr Yam’s application must be

briefly.  There was a time when the applicant was reasonably well off by reason of her successful estate agent business in Vietnam.
 A downturn of the Vietnam property market resulted in not only her business failure, but also her failure to repay a loan owed to
a local loan shark.  The applicant claims that the loan shark assaulted her and threatened to kill her because the applicant failed
to repay the loan.  The Vietnam police did not render any help to the applicant. Upon her mother’s advice, the applicant left Vietnam
for China in December 2014, and ultimately arrived in Hong Kong. 6.  This application suffers from various procedural and/or evidential defects/irregularities (see para 2 to 4 above).  Irrespective
of these inadequacies, a perusal of the challenged decisions shows that they have considered the applicant’s case in considerable

grading.  The ordinary English meaning of the word “effective” is not negative or derogatory.  More importantly, she has not
explained whether such a grading would result in some practical harm or disadvantage to her or her employment with the Institute
(such as her wages, her work title, her post and her scope of work).  In this connection, it should be noted: 8.  Finally, this application was commenced in July 2017, more than half a year after the applicant became aware of the Report. While
accepting that there was a delay in commencing this application, the applicant attempts to explain that time has been taken up by
seeking legal advice.  However, delay caused by a need to seek legal advice is usually not a valid reason; there is no exceptional
circumstance to justify a departure from that view. 9.  For the above reasons, this application is refused.",(Andrew Chung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1966.html,"

which there is no reason to think are insolvent, should only be made in straightforward cases where it is clear to the petitioner’s
lawyers that there is little ground for the debtor company to dispute liability.  If there is doubt about this, then the prudent
course is to proceed to obtain judgment to recover the sums believed to be payable.  12.  So far as I can see from the papers which I have before me, this is a case, which in my view, it should have been appreciated was
not suitable for the winding-up procedure.  It may be that that was not immediately apparent at the time the statutory demand was
issued, but it seems to me that if an objective view had been taken of the information that I would imagine would clearly have become
available during the course of April 2017, that should have been the conclusion that was reached, and it should have been agreed
that the statutory demand be withdrawn.  13.  It seems to me that in the circumstances it is, therefore, appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision on Costs: 8 November 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2136.html,"

 Yet there was no attempt by Chen to join at all, even when the action was set down.  Even assuming Chen was in fact waiting for

whether the delay in enforcing the Loan Agreement had caused any loss to the Plaintiff when it is agreed that it was a sour loan.
 There is certainly no evidence of proof of any loss or how it flowed from the breach of duty of care.  71.  Mr Chu argued that the Plaintiff had lost HK$7.5 million (the principal of the Loan), and that the Plaintiff had lost the opportunity
to extract that sum from Chau and Chiu.  With respect, that the arguments are fundamentally misconceived and contrary to the evidence.
 The sour loan could not have a value of HK$7.5 million.  The parties negotiating the settlement were all shrewd businessmen.  Chau
and Chiu would not have agreed to accept any personal responsibility over that sour loan or the CN. This is reflected by the evidence,
eg, that Chau refused Tang’s request to stand as warrantor to the Agreement.  72.  For the above reasons, I dismiss this action with an order nisi that the costs of this action be paid by the Plaintiff, to be taxed

be required.  However, she has done nothing to identify those 10 to 15 days.  She is well advised to proceed to obtain a CD of the
proceedings in the criminal trial and pick the relevant days of transcript evidence to be transcribed by the court as soon as possible. 12.  As for the 600 boxes of liquidators’ documents, it is not for Ms Kwok to fish for evidence without even stating her affirmation
in opposition.  The necessary documents in support of the liquidators’ case have already been given to her as exhibits to the liquidators’
affirmations.  I will not exclude the possibility that with a proper affirmation in opposition and with sufficient identification
of relevant documents, the court will permit Ms Kwok to file a further affirmation or a further summons for production of documents
should circumstances require.  But as of the present, I require Ms Kwok to file an affirmation in opposition to the liquidators’

PHILIP SECURITIES (HONG KONG) LTD v. 3I CAPITAL GROUP CORP AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2417; HCA 1905/2014 (15 November 2017),"17.  This is an area that has also been affected by the CJR.  I refer to what Deputy High Court Judge Mimmie Chan (as she then was) said
in Sunny Tadjudin v Bank of America, National Association (HCA 322/2008).  It is clear that post CJR, the court should give effect to the underlying objectives of the rules and procedures
when it exercises its power under Order 24, and when it interprets the provisions of Order 24.  In deciding whether any document
relates to the matter in question in the action, whether any document is or has been in the possession, custody or power of the party,
and whether discovery of a document sought is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, the
court should always bear in mind the objectives of cost-effectiveness, expeditious disposal of cases, proportionality, procedural
economy, and insurance of fairness between the parties.  18.  If I turn to consider the categories of documents which the defendants seek, I would first observe that they are extremely broad
in their nature, and secondly, that in many cases, they seek categories of documents which are, or should already have been, in the
defendant’s possession, or in respect of which there is no clear evidence of their relevance.  I am not satisfied that the documents,
discovery of which is sought, have been specifically identified so as to be clear of their existence, nor am I persuaded that such
categories are necessarily relevant to the matters in issue in the action, and these are prerequisites for the exercise of my discretion.
 The lateness of this application without any explanation would, in any event, militate against my exercising the discretion I have
here.  That is the conclusion of my decisions. 19.  I make an order that the defendants should pay the plaintiff’s costs because I think, in this case, the costs should follow the
event.",Date of Decision: 15 November 2017(Patrick Sherrington),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2417.html,"

was only represented by their solicitor, Mr Ching, on the other hand the time spent by the parties in arguing over the 1st category is the most substantial among the different categories sought under the 1st summons but the defendants failed in the 1st category.  Not only that, the defendants had also written several letters to the court after the hearing in relation to their application
for seeking leave to adduce further affidavit evidence on matters about the authenticity of the title deeds.  This necessitated the
plaintiff to write a letter in response, and the defendants also failed in such application. 64.  In these circumstances, it is just and fair to make no order as to costs of the 1st summons. 65.

LEUNG TAK HING v. WU ANTHONY [2017] HKCFI 2038; HCPI 1327/2016 (20 November 2017),"5.  The grounds of appeal that have been filed in respect of my alleged failure to follow the English guidelines on instructing overseas
experts have missed the point. I reached my decision on 19 September 2017 for the special reason set out in §3 above and I specifically
stated that I did not want this decision to be a precedent and that there were many factors that needed to be considered and debated
before the court could set out established principles in this area. I identified in my decision some of those factors which would
need to be debated at an appropriate time in a future case. 6.  Once I permitted the plaintiff to rely on Professor Nutting, it followed that I ought to permit him to instruct an overseas radiologist
to enable ease of communication between him and Professor Nutting, just as the defendant’s expert oncologist in Hong Kong would
enjoy ease of communication with the defendant’s expert radiologist in Hong Kong.  I do not see any merit in the grounds of appeal
filed in respect of my decision to permit the plaintiff to instruct an overseas radiologist. 7.

if I was to find in their favour they should get the costs not only of this summons but also the abortive costs associated with the
summons for final judgement and/or judgement on admissions, which I adjourned pending this decision.  The plaintiff’s submission
was that even in relation to this summons I should make a cost order nisi, and that if I were to find for the defendant the question of the costs of the adjourned summons should be reserved for a separate
hearing. 31.  There was no dispute between the parties that there was an arbitration clause in the contracts between them and having satisfied
myself that the defendant has established good grounds that the action be stayed and referred to arbitration, it follows in my judgement
that the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs with a certificate for two counsel. I also consider that those costs should
be payable immediately. 32.  As to the costs of the adjourned summons, this was not of course formally heard but, given my decision and in light of the submissions
I heard on costs which impliedly accepted that the plaintiff’s summons depended on the plaintiff succeeding on this application,
I make an order dismissing the plaintiff’s adjourned summons and ordering that the costs should also be payable immediately by
the plaintiff to the defendant.  I note in this connection that the plaintiff’s summons was issued after the defendant’s acknowledgement
of service at a time therefore when the plaintiff was well aware there was going to be a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court.",Date of Judgment: 21 November 2017(Patrick Sherrington),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2048.html,"

 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the decision on costs and interest and its comprehension. 
It does not mean those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have
also been considered. 24.  At one stage, the plaintiffs’ solicitors repeatedly requested the court to hand down a “corrigendum” regarding interest on
the judgment sum.  The reason why that matter (and the costs of this action) was not considered has been mentioned in para 4 above.
 As experience (and the contents of the parties’ subsequent written submissions) shows, this is a matter where the parties ought
to be given a proper opportunity to state their case.  It is thus not properly a matter for a “corrigendum”. 25.  Similar to what happened in the main claim in this action, neither party has been entirely successful.  The costs in relation to
the issues of interest and costs should likewise be: the parties themselves should bear their own costs.","WONG HING YEE(黃馨儀)

should apply the law firmly and consistently.  However, the court stated in Bayanmunkh that the extension of mercy has always been part of a judge’s armory in dispensing justice.  34.  There has been a plea of guilty from the outset, there is clear contrition by the Appellant.  It is evident that this is one such
case where the court should extend mercy to the Appellant.  In this case upon consultation with all collateral contacts as mentioned
above the probation officer has recommended that the Appellant be reunited with his family.  The wife has no relations or friends.
 The family have no support.  Although there is follow up and assistance from ISS, that has proved to be insufficient for this family
in these circumstances.  There is credible evidence that the Appellant’s absence from his wife and children has been highly detrimental
to the health and welfare of the family.  The accumulation of the personal circumstances of the family as highlighted in the second
SWR including those that have arisen post-sentence are in my view wholly exceptional circumstances for the court to temper justice
with mercy.  35.  I accept that on the specific facts of this case it is appropriate that leniency be extended to the Appellant.  As the Appellant
has served part of the sentence initially imposed, I allow the appeal and reduce the sentence to one of 4 months’ imprisonment
in order for the Appellant to be released immediately.","SALEEM ASAD

MARRAKESH INVESTMENTS LTD v. TANGIERS HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2343; HCCW 352/2016 (28 November 2017),"18.  As I have already explained, it is well established that a petition seeking a winding-up order against a solvent company by a shareholder
should state why a winding-up order rather than a share buy‑out order may be necessary.  To present a petition which does not do
so is prima facie an abuse of process.  Of course there will be occasions in which the failure to include a precise reason for seeking a winding-up
order will be an oversight or result from infelicities in the drafting of the petition.  It does not, however, seems to me that this
is such a case.  19.  The problems with the 1st petition should have focused minds on the criteria which apply to petitions of this sort.  The fact that the present petition makes
no reference to, for example, a concern about the 1st respondent’s ability to buy the shares of the petitioner suggests that there was no motivation in presenting the 2nd petition other than putting pressure on the 1st respondent to improve his offer.  The subsequent conduct of the proceedings which I have referred to earlier by the petitioner also
points to the conclusion that this, at each stage of the proceedings, is what has motivated the petitioner.  Even the fact that it
was not until immediately before the present hearing, and I understand from Mr Ho that he was only instructed yesterday, that the
petitioner agreed to the present petition being dismissed suggests that the petitioner’s approach is driven purely by commercial
considerations rather than the sort of considerations relevant to the inclusion of a prayer for a winding-up order.  20.  It does, therefore, seem to me that this is an appropriate case to make not only a costs order against the petitioner with a certificate
for two counsel, but also to order that the petitioner pays the costs of the petition on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 28 November 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2343.html,"

the interim stay sought by the applicant) and that they were to make submissions on grounds other than those that could be made by
the TPB (see Yiu Lian’s original substantive skeleton submissions opposing).  These amount to additional justifications to also
order costs against the applicant in favour of them. 21.  Finally, the applicant has submitted that she should not bear the putative parties’ costs incurred in preparing the opposing affirmations
as they were initially filed without leave of the court.  I am unable to accept this submission. First, before the applicant withdrew
her application, the parties had in correspondence contested on whether leave should be granted for the filing of those affirmations.
 She therefore was aware of the potentiality that leave might be granted eventually.  Second and in any event, leave was indeed subsequently
granted to the filing of those affirmations before she decided to withdraw the leave application.  In the premises, there are no reasons why the costs of affirmation should not be
treated as part and parcel of the putative parties’ costs of the leave application. 22.  For the above reasons, I order that costs of the leave application (including the costs of the opposing affirmations) be to the

as the right to attend and vote at company’s meeting is concerned, the register is conclusive, but not for other purposes.  There
is obvious policy reason for such a rule of convenience.  But these cases did not go that far as to support the proposition that
the entries in the register is conclusive evidence of membership.  In fact, there is strong authority to the contrary.  In Reese River Silver Mining Co Ltd v Smith[5], Lord Westbury held that the register is only prima facie but not conclusive evidence.  The court would always look at the factual circumstances of the case.  He said[6]: 16.  Having come to the conclusion that the Petitioner has no locus standi to present this petition, there is no need to consider the second ground for striking out.  Indeed, to commence proceedings which
are bound to fail is in itself an abuse of process.  I do not intend to consider the grounds of the petition.  Even if the Petitioner
has an arguable case, he is bound to fail as he has no locus standi.  I cannot help thinking that his motive for presenting the petition was to put pressure on the 2nd Respondentto settle his contractual claim under the Agreement.  Even if he is a victim of breach of the Agreement, his remedy should
lie in contract against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. Maybe he has other difficulties in bringing an action in contract.  That is not a reason to present a petition for winding
up the companies. 17.  For the above reasons, I find that the Petitioner has no locus standi to present this petition.  Accordingly, the petition is struck out with costs against the Petitioner.  Such costs are to be taxed,

account to the time when the same was transferred to the defendant’s personal friend) is not oppressive, and should be within the
power of the defendant. 30.  I have therefore made an order for account at the hearing with costs to the plaintiff and summarily assessed.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 30 November 2017(Elaine Liu),Master of the High Court,/2017/2138.html,"

for me slavishly to repeat them.  There is no defence to this action.  The lapse of time between the service of the Statement of
Claim and the issue of the Order 14 application is not in the circumstances of this case of any significance.  There are probably
many reasons why the plaintiff in view of its position as a charity in the United States, Hong Kong and elsewhere decided to hold
its hand for a while to see how matters might resolve themselves but it is pointless to seek to identify them.  Its prime objective
was, and is, humanitarian medical treatment based heavily on volunteer professional expertise and generous benefactors — the heavy
expenditure of funds on litigation is not a priority. 44.  There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the terms prayed for in paragraphs 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Statement of
Claim. 45.  There will also be an order for costs in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant.  I am conscious that this burden will fall
upon the funds donated to the defendant by benefactors and sponsors who may well be largely unaware of the defendant’s rationale.
 In relation to that I am compelled to say that in my view it was poor judgment and irresponsible to commit a charity to this litigation
on the strength of spurious contentions.",[2013] EWHC 1088 (Ch)(Conrad Seagroatt),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2141.html,"

month, mainly to pay staff, including mandatory provident funds. Mr Chan’s objection is that the defendants have not provided clear
evidence that they have no other assets to pay the relevant expenses.  However, it is relevant that (i) the Mareva injunction currently restrains the defendants from dealing with or disposing of assets up to the huge sum of HK$362,848,000, (ii)
the existing order only allows the defendants to spend HK$50,000 per week by way of business expenses which, I take it, was set without
much consideration of the actual requirements of the defendants, as one would expect when an ex parte Mareva injunction is sought (I should make it clear that this observation is not intended to be a criticism), and (iii) there is evidence
that the 2nd defendant has to pay salaries to 13 to 14 employees.  Obviously, the court should be careful not to do anything which may result
in those employees being left without payment of salaries.  I am also minded to fix an early hearing date of the discharge applications. 8.   In all the circumstances, I shall vary paragraph (1) of the “Exception to this Order” as per paragraph 3 of the schedule to

TRANSCORP HOLDINGS LTD v. CHAN KOON CHOW [2017] HKCFI 2146; HCA 2719/2016 (1 December 2017),"24.  The Incorp Agreement issued to WW Premium was signed by Goh.  It refers in its appendix to an advance payment of €1.999 million
received by Incorp, after the remittance made by THL to Incorp on 29 May 2015 of the earnest money of €2 million paid by THL under
the Agreement.  The appendix was initialed by Goh.  It is unbelievable that Goh had no knowledge of the use of the earnest money,
and it would have been inconceivable that Goh and THL would not have complained or raised queries that the Incorp Agreement, and
the distribution rights granted thereunder, was issued to WW Premium, instead of WW China, if Goh and THL had not in fact consented
to the use of WW Premium as the joint venture vehicle to which the Exclusive Right was to be granted pursuant to the Agreement. 25.  On the facts shown and on the evidence available at this stage, I consider that Chan has raised factual matters in dispute which
are sufficiently credible, and which constitute reasonable grounds that a bona fide and arguable defence exists to the claims made
by THL.  26.  Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal and grant unconditional leave to Chan to defend the action.  An order nisi will be made for the

when assessing the credibility of the appellant’s version of events.  However, these points were not raised by the appellant at
trial, who was represented by experienced counsel.  These are matters of mixed law and facts.  I do not consider that these points

third discount to his sentence.  However, as I have pointed out, this offence occurred whilst the defendant was on bail and this
is a serious aggravating factor which warrants an enhancement.  I will increase the starting point to 8 years and 4 months’ imprisonment,

excessively or wrong in principle.  The magistrate has duly given the appellant the appropriate discount for his guilty plea.  The
length of the disqualification order is also appropriate. 18.  While it is appreciated that the appellant’s care and assistance to his girlfriend who has just given birth to a baby would be
desirable, this cannot be a valid mitigating factor in the circumstances of the present case. 19.  The overall sentences in Charge 1 and Charge 2 are neither manifestly excessive nor wrong in principle.  Accordingly, the appeal

beneficial interest of the Property was with the Son “since June 2010” or at least at the time of the Bankruptcy Order. Even
if I were to consider the Resolution (which I have found I should not), its terms showed the “DISTRIBUTION ADVANCEMENT” allegedly
took effect on 18 August 2017, which was far too late to have any legal effect. The relevant time for consideration was the date
of the Bankruptcy Order (ie 16 August 2016). It would not be possible to make distribution in relation to the Grantors’ interest
in the Property after 16 August 2016. 26.  I am not persuaded the proposed grounds of appeal had any reasonable prospects of success, and the Leave Summons is dismissed. There
shall be a costs order nisi that costs of the Leave Summons be paid by the Bankrupt personally to the TiB to be taxed if not agreed. 27.  At the Leave Hearing, the Bankrupt expressed his frustration that it appeared from information provided by the TiB that the TiB’s
income, costs and dividend exceeded $1.8 million, which translated into nil distribution to the creditors. However, this complaint
is not relevant to the subject matter of the Summons and/or Leave Summons, and might well have to be addressed separately.",Date of Handing Down Decision: 13 December 2017(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2205.html,"

summons in HCMP 2548/2017 for leave to commence a derivative action. The originating summons relates to the affairs of CNT Group
Limited (“Company”) which is a listed company. Leave is sought to commence proceedings against three people identified in the originating summons. 2.  The Company after consideration has, primarily as I understand it, with a view to the underlying disputes being substantively resolved
as swiftly as possible, agreed to leave being granted.  The consequence of this is that dates in June which had been identified for
the hearing of the petition, which it having been agreed that leave be granted the petitioner agrees to withdraw, should now be used
for substantive trial of the derivative action.  The costs of the originating summons and the costs of the derivative action itself
will be dealt with at the trial in June, as will the costs of the petition. 3.  The parties have addressed me at some length on the directions that should be made to bring the derivative action to trial.  I will

HKSAR v. SZE KA YIM [2017] HKCFI 2213; HCCC 334/2016 (14 December 2017),"11. Section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance sets out the requirements and power for a hospital order in respect of mentally disordered offenders.  The purpose of this power
is to appropriately deal with and treat a mentally disordered offender by addressing the issue and also ensuring the future protection
of the public.  It is therefore important that an hospital order specifies whether the offender should be committed to a psychiatric
centre or a mental hospital and whether that should be for a determinate or indeterminate period.  It is for this reason that such
an order must be supported by medical evidence from two medical practitioners, one of which under section 46 is required to be a medical officer. 12.  From the information at hand, I am of the view, that the defendant has a serious mental disorder and poses as a grave threat to
members of the public.  He has engaged in acts of violence in the past that has led the relevant medical authorities to classify
him as a target person, that is, a potentially violent case.  Unfortunately, the defendant’s proneness to violence has resulted
in the death of his mother.  His long history of aggressive and violent behaviour warrants that the hospital order be for an indeterminate
period.  This is supported by the psychiatric evidence. 13.  In accordance with section 45, having been satisfied that the requirements have been met or fulfilled, I order that the defendant be committed to a Correctional
Services Department Psychiatric Centre for an indeterminate period, pursuant to section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.  The recommendation of the two government psychiatrists is that the defendant be committed to the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre.

stage.  The Magistrate did consider the legal principles in cases Tong Cun Lin[5], Hui Yui Sang[6] and Ting James Henry[7].  The Magistrate said that he “noticed while there were loud sounds of slapping and kicking of the boot and back of the taxi, there
was a lack of sound of kicking of the offside rear fender.”[8]  While the Magistrate said he “acquitted the Defendant because Mr Tong’s evidence, which was crucial to the Prosecution case,
could not be relied upon”, it was: 10.  In my view, it is clear that the Appellant had brought suspicion on him and the Magistrate was entitled not to grant costs in favour

HKSAR v. WALSH KENT ANDREW [2017] HKCFI 2246; HCCC 368/2015 (15 December 2017),"6.  He relies on the expression that the court can “direct otherwise” of the wording of the subsection.  As is apparent, this is
an old provision that is clearly limited in its application, addressing the apparel and the appearance of the accused person before
the court.  It does not provide, in my view, a power to the court to absent an accused person from his or her arraignment.  I am
informed by Mr Neil Mitchell, for the prosecution, that the Prosecution Division do not consent to the accused being absent from
his arraignment, and in any event, he submits that the subsection does not give the power to the Court as suggested by Mr McCoy.
 I agree. 7.  The second suggestion by Mr McCoy, in disposing of this case without the defendant’s attendance, is to arraign the defendant by
way of television link.  However, as rightly pointed out by Mr Mitchell, the provision for television link communication with the
court is only in relation to the taking of evidence from witnesses.  See sections 79H to 79L, the Live Television Link (Witnesses outside Hong Kong) Rules, and the Practice Direction 9.9.  It does not include the arraignment
of an accused.  8.  Accordingly, I am of the view that the two methods suggested by Mr McCoy for the arraignment of the defendant without his attendance
are not open to the Court. ",WALSH KENT ANDREW(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2246.html,"

CHINA CITIC BANK INTERNATIONAL LTD v. DURRANT SIMON PATRICK MICHAEL [2017] HKCFI 2250; HCMP 3196/2013 (15 December 2017),"12.  Under this section, a mortgagee is required to apply the proceeds of sale of a mortgaged property in the order mentioned in sub-paragraphs
(a) to (d) and pay the residue (if any) to “the person who, immediately before any sale or other dealing, was entitled to the mortgaged
land or authorized to give a receipt for the proceeds of the sale of that land”.  Such person would generally be the next subsequent
mortgagee or, if there is no subsequent mortgagee, the mortgagor (see Nield S and Da Roza AM, Hong Kong Conveyancing and Property Law Handbook (2007), paragraph CP54.10).  As mentioned above, there are a number of subsequent encumbrancers after the plaintiff.  The defendant
says that some of those subsequent encumbrancres have been paid off, and there is one encumbrancer (Mr Chan Wing Sun) who has agreed
to remove his encumbrance within 7 days of receipt of the sum of HK$250,000.  It is not necessary for the court in the present application
to determine who would be the next encumbrancer to whom the plaintiff should pay the residue of the proceeds of sale, because it
is the plaintiff’s duty to ascertain the person next entitled to the residue of the proceeds of sale.  There is also no evidence
to suggest that the plaintiff will not apply the proceeds of sale of the Property in accordance with Section 54 of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance.  I should mention that Mr Ip has, on behalf of the plaintiff, given an undertaking to the court to hand over the residue of the
proceeds of sale to the next person entitled thereto within 14 days after completion of the sale of the Property.  The defendant
has failed, in my view, to make out a case that he is entitled to be paid directly by the plaintiff 50% or more of the proceeds of
sale (after deduction of the outstanding amounts due under the subsisting encumbrances) within 24 hours of the date of completion. 13.  Lastly, I should mention that, in the defendant’s skeleton argument received by the court on 14 December 2017, the defendant seeks
some further relief, including injunction and vesting order, against the plaintiff.  However, such relief is not mentioned in the
Summons, and it does not appear to me that there is any proper or sufficient basis for such relief to be granted by the court. 14.  For the foregoing reasons, the Summons is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed.  The plaintiff’s undertaking
to the court should be recorded in the sealed order.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2250.html,"

merit in his appeal cannot be defined as a miscarriage of justice and the fact the applicant was unrepresented in his appeal has
not shown to be procedurally unfair. 27.  I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator either. Nor do I see any other evidence of procedural

Angola and Achieve Goal submits that the documents sought would be relevant to Section 49(2)(d) of the Evidence Ordinance, ie for challenging whether Zhang had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters.  6.  This discovery is, in my view, for a collateral purpose of attacking credibility, and, as submitted by Mr Wang, even this credibility
issue will not touch on the core issue of the case as to interest in the shares between Zhong Xin and Angola.  The agreement sought
to be discovered was in 2011, and there is no apparent purpose to be served by adducing such evidence at this stage.  Details of
the sale of the shares between Zhang and another simply is not relevant to any part of the case at all.  I therefore dismiss the
summons for discovery.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2379.html,"

RE SHING PUI KEUNG [2017] HKCFI 2274; HCB 686/2017 (20 December 2017),"32.  For the petitioner, Mr Chan has made some valid criticisms of Shing’s case including an inconsistency in relation to the period
covered by the alleged agreement between Shing’s affirmation and his earlier solicitors’ letter.  Ultimately, however, this is
a question of fact and there is no evidence from Woo to deny the oral agreement, nor any explanation why no such evidence has been
adduced (although Woo has left the petitioner, there is no suggestion he cannot be found or is hostile).  Further, Ben So has also
made an affirmation stating he was present at the meeting and confirming Shing’s account.  Indeed, Ben So said that subsequently
he chased Woo many times on Shing’s behalf and Woo stated that the money would be released once the formal papers were ready. 
On the evidence before me I am unable to dismiss Shing’s case as lacking in substance for being incredible. 33.  Overall the evidence and arguments put forward on Shing’s behalf in my view passed the hurdle, even if not with flying colours.
 I do not consider that his claims are so lacking in substance as to permit the petitioner to obtain a bankruptcy order against him.
 After all, bankruptcy proceedings are summary in nature and intended for clear cases and even a cross-claim said to be “somewhat
shadowy” had been held to constitute a defence[1], although ultimately it is a question of applying the established principles to the facts of each case. 34.  For these reasons, the bankruptcy petition is dismissed. There will be an order nisi that the petitioner do pay Shing the costs of the petition.","Between 3 and 4 years of the Effective Date

SZETO YUK LIN v. KANTON LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2292; HCMP 251/2016 (27 December 2017),"9.  D6 was prepared by solicitors and counsel.  D6 claims a total of $99,800 comprising: $1,100 for manual work; $33,000 for communications
(totaled 9.25 hours); $39,000 for professional work (totaled 9.75 hours); $27,600 for counsel fee and $200 for disbursement.  10.  I note that D6’s counsel has a standing of 4 years.  There are two fee earners from D6’s solicitors: one is Mr Ng (admitted
in 1993) and the other is a trainee solicitor and they charge a combined hourly rate of $4,000.  However, there are no breakdowns
as to how much time was spent by the solicitors and how much time by the trainee solicitor.  11.  In my assessment, the counsel fee is reasonable and the same can be said of the manual work and the disbursement.  However, the
fees claimed (for communications and professional work) by the fee-earners of D6’s solicitors are on the high side, bearing in
mind that counsel was briefed.  By a very broad brush approach, a global amount of $65,000 for D6’s costs would in my view be reasonable

been filed, since astonishingly neither side produced a copy thereof to me in the first place, I am not satisfied that the offer

was reasonable or not, because even if it was not the position is simply that neither side had made a reasonable offer, and the plaintiff
has no basis to say that Glendale was to be blamed for the fact that the hearing on 28 November 2017 did take place.  The fact remains
that the hearing took place because of the unmeritorious objections taken by the plaintiff. 30.  I make absolute the costs order nisi.

The question of possible “symptoms magnification” or “malingering” is inevitably raised in many of these claims.  As such, one should be careful in allowing another layer of expert evidence like such
neuropsychological tests which would only increase the costs further.  I am not, of course, excluding the possibility that there
may be special circumstances when such neuropsychological tests can be justified, but the court will need to hear convincing reasons
as to why, under those circumstances, the “tried-and-tested” system in trial proceedings is inadequate to answer this question
and that the extra time and costs needed is justifiable. 44.  I would accordingly direct that no leave be granted to the plaintiff to adduce the neuropsychological test report by Dr. Suzanne

The Administrator accused the Pangs of adopting a delaying tactic by resisting this separate trial application and by seeking unnecessarily

discovery was sought because of the uncooperative and evasive attitude of the Administrator.  I do not have to decide who was responsible
for this state of affairs.  The Pangs were seeking maintenance. There could be no reason for them to delay the progress of the proceedings.
Non-production of the documents ordered is now an undisputed fact.  The Pangs are entitled to rely on evidence as to thesize and
nature of the net estate of the Deceased to advance their case and todiscredit the Administrator.  To require a separate trial on
liability without such evidence would be unjust to the Pangs and would give the Administratoran unfair advantage.  Furthermore, if
the Pangs succeed on the liability issue, much of the evidence adduced for the section 5(1)(e) issue would have to be repeated in
the trial on quantum.  A separate trial would be inconvenient to both parties.   It is clearly not appropriate for this issue. 22.  The first and second issues of liability are separate and distinct from the issue of quantum.  A separate trial in respect of these
issues would not be unjust but will not make it any more convenient to either party.  It is probably a neutral consideration.  If

million with interest to run from 7 April 2016 to this day at US dollar prime rate plus 1% and thereafter at judgment rate until
payment.  The costs of and occasioned by this action, including all costs reserved, be paid by Liu and YYL, to be taxed if not agreed.
 16.  Finally, for the purpose of aiding the enforcement of this judgment, it is appropriate to extend the Mareva Injunction granted by
Mr Justice Lok on 4 May 2016 against Liu and YYL and continued by Madam Justice B Chu on 13 May 2016 until satisfaction of the judgment
herein or further order, and I so order.","JIEYANG YADE TRADE CO., LTD (揭阳市雅得鞋业有限公司)

ZHANG HONG LI AND OTHERS v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 34; HCCL 2/2011 (9 January 2018),"18.  Even though the summons for the stay had been refixed to be heard many months later on 6 December 2017, nobody expected the appeal
to be listed to be heard so early.  The idea of proceeding with the quantum exercise before the Court of Appeal heard the appeal
was sensible because if an appeal was also going to be lodged against my assessment on quantum, the Court of Appeal could deal with
it at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal.  However, given the further steps that needed to be taken, as set out
in §15(a) above, and given the state of the court’s diary, it was not possible, between 6 December 2017 and 8 May 2018, to complete
the quantum exercise in sufficient time to enable an appeal to be lodged against my assessment of quantum and to be dealt with by
the Court of Appeal at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal. 19.  For these reasons, I exercised my discretion to make the directions set out in §15 above.  Given the current state of affairs,
the road map provided by these directions is a pragmatic solution which enables the 3rd and 4th plaintiffs to refix the assessment of quantum expeditiously in the event that the 2nd and 4th defendants’ appeal is dismissed. 20.  Parties ought not to be granted the indulgence of fixing hearing dates in consultation with counsels’ diaries in cases which ought

FUNG HING CHIU CYRIL v. HENRY WAI &AMP; CO (A FIRM) [2018] HKCFI 31; [2018] 1 HKLRD 808; [2018] 3 HKC 375; HCMP 1699/2017 (10 January 2018),"55.  The object and principles of the Ordinance (stated in s 3) are to facilitate the fair and speedy resolution of disputes by arbitration
without unnecessary expense, and that the Court should interfere in the arbitration of a dispute “only as expressly provided for
in the Ordinance”. It would be contrary to such object and principles if the Court should entertain an application for the determination
of the validity of an arbitration agreement after arbitration has commenced and before the tribunal makes a preliminary or final
decision on its jurisdiction, outside the regime set out in ss 34 and 81 of the Ordinance.  Even if (as argued on behalf of CF and
GA) there is any concurrent jurisdiction on the part of the Court to rule on the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement,
such jurisdiction should very rarely be exercised when an arbitration has already been commenced, a tribunal constituted, and the
challenge to the agreement can be determined by the tribunal as a preliminary issue, as in this case. 56.  The application by originating summonses in these proceedings are dismissed, for all the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs.
 There are no merits in the resistance to the application for stay of these proceedings to arbitration, and I grant the stay with
an order nisi that the costs of and occasioned by the application for stay, and the costs of and occasioned by the dismissal of the
originating summonses, be paid by CF and GA on an indemnity basis, with certificate for 2 counsel. 57.  As explained by the arbitration judge in A v R (Arbitration: Enforcement) [2009] 3 HKLRD, parties should be entitled to expect that the Court will enforce arbitration agreements and arbitral awards made
pursuant thereto as a matter of course.  Challenges to the Courts should be exceptional events.  Hence, a party who takes an exceptional
and high-risk strategy to challenge the validity of either an arbitral award or an arbitration agreement will have to take the risk
and accept the higher costs consequences of its action, namely, costs on an indemnity basis.  This is only consistent with the objectives
of the Ordinance and those of the CJR.","HENRY WAI & CO (a firm)

MUHAMMAD AZAM v. DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THETORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 4; HCAL 161/2017 (11 January 2018),"69.  On the hearing date, I refused an application to adjourn for the purpose of the applicant to obtain and hear the audio tape of the
appeal hearing.  No specific reason could be given for that purpose and I found the objective was a fishing exercise therefore, I
refused the application.  After hearing submissions for leave I adjourned and reserved my decision.  Three weeks later, solicitors
for the applicant filed a further ex parte summons applying for leave to re-amend the Form 86 and add a further ground, applying for leave to file further evidence by way of
another affirmation and applying for leave to file a supplemental submission attaching an unofficial uncertified transcript of the
audio recording of the oral appeal hearing. 70.  It would generally require an exceptional case before the court is prepared to accede to consider additional amendments and evidence
after it has adjourned to consider its decision, see Charlesworth v Relay Roads Ltd & Others [1999] EWHC 829;  [2000] 1 WLR 230.  I did consider the additional submissions and amendment; I saw no merit in the additional ground and the transcript was of minimal
assistance to the claimant.  From the transcript, the adjudicator was accused of misstating the applicant’s evidence, considering
irrelevant matters and acting unfairly which were sweeping accusations I disagreed with.  I did not grant leave to further amend
the Form 86, produce a further affirmation or additional evidence or submissions. 71.  After a careful examination of the submissions I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator.
 I see no evidence of procedural unfairness nor a failure to adhere to a high standard of fairness.  The substantive decision did
satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was not Wednesbury unreasonable.  None of the grounds put forth by the applicant were arguable
so as to satisfy the test in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Chan & anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676 paras 14-17. In my judgement, the applicant’s claim is not reasonably arguable.  There is no realistic prospect of success and

HKSAR v. RANJIT SINGH [2018] HKCFI 57; HCMA 538/2017 (11 January 2018),"7.  The appellant, representing himself in the appeal, had put forward several grounds of appeal.  At first he alleged that the evidence
showed that the identity card was about a hundred feet away from him.  However, at page 33 of the Appeal Bundle, at Line K in the
submission of the Defence counsel, he did mention that the ID card according to PW1 had fallen about a metre away and according to
PW2 was one and a half metres away from the appellant’s leg, so it was not really as the appellant said a hundred feet away. However,
the appellant further submitted that if he was taking out his Form 8, how could he have thrown away the identity card.  And he questioned
why the CCTV camera tape was not produced and there was no evidence that his fingerprints were found on the identity card. 8.  As I have explained to the appellant, this court is an appeal against conviction, only examines the evidence which was before the
learned magistrate, and if as the learned magistrate had made a proper assessment of the evidence before him and whether the evidence
before him was sufficient to ground the conviction. 9.  In this case, as Mr Daryanani pointed out that the learned magistrate said this is a “one‑on‑one” case in that PW1 alleged
that the identity card was taken out of the appellant’s back pocket together with the Form 8 and the appellant asserted in cross‑examination
that it was not his.  The learned magistrate was fully aware of the situation and after having properly assessed the evidence and
concluded that PW1 was an honest and reliable witness and therefore convicted the appellant.  I cannot see any grounds for interfering
with the learned magistrate’s conviction, so the appeal against conviction is dismissed.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/57.html,"

The further and better particulars sought by the Plaintiff are as follows:- 38.  I consider that the Plaintiff is entitled to the particulars sought.  I am unable to accept Mr Fung’s submissions that those particulars
relate to “matters of evidence”, or are “wholly unnecessary for the fair disposal of this action or for saving costs”.  It
seems to me that the requests ask for particulars of fact which go directly to the Defendant’s allegation that “GE,Mr.Lo,variousoftheChildren,andthePlaintiff”
were “important” customers of the HSBC Group, and would explain why the Original Trustee and the Defendant would be prepared
to accept a fixed percentage fee for acting as trustee of the Trust which, according to the Plaintiff, is “relatively insubstantial
compared with the value of the Trust Fund”. 39.  For the foregoing reasons, I order the Defendant to give the particular sought by the Plaintiff referred to in paragraph 37 above
within 14 days of the date of the order herein.  On the issue of costs, most of the time at the hearing on 21 December 2017 was spent
on the first set of requests, which the Defendant has successfully resisted.  Overall, I consider that a fair order to make would
be that the Defendant shall have 80% of the costs of the application, to be taxed if not agreed, and I so order.  In view of the
fact that the application relates only to a matter of particulars which seems to me to be relatively straight forward, I am not inclined
to grant certificate for two counsel.  This having been said, I should acknowledge that I have substantially benefitted from the
careful and cogent submissions of counsel from both sides, to whom I am greatly indebted.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/33.html,"

"HKSAR v. CHAN HEI CHUN, JOSEPH [2018] HKCFI 61; HCCC 193/2017 (12 January 2018)","9.  Count 1 concerns a quantity of Ice of 12g. Count 2 is simple possession of a small quantity of Ice which the prosecution has accepted
was for the defendant’s own consumption.  The starting point tariff as provided by HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 for the quantity of Ice in Count 1 is 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.  The range of sentence for simple possession in the circumstances
of this case is 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment.  See HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] HKCA 61; [2001] 1 HKC 261.  The defendant has had a serious drug addiction and on his own admission, he had been consuming Ice since 2008.  10.  As the defendant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, he is entitled to a one-third discount to his sentences.  See HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2015] HKCFI 1752; [2016] 1 HKLRD 1.  Accordingly, the starting points will be reduced on Count 1 from 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment to 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment, and on Count 2 from 9 months’ imprisonment to 6 months’ imprisonment.  11.  I bear in mind that if the quantity of drugs in the possession count had been added to the quantity of drugs in the trafficking
count, the starting point would have made very little difference to the resultant sentence.  To illustrate this point, on an arithmetic
calculation, the quantity of 12 g would result in a starting point of 85.6 months’ imprisonment, and 12.14 g would result in a
starting point of 85.72 months’ imprisonment.  For this reason, as well as bearing in mind the totality principle, I will order
that the sentences on the two counts be served concurrently.  Accordingly, the defendant will serve a sentence of 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/61.html,"

CHEN MEI HUAN v. SILVER FAITH HOLDINGS LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 41; HCCW 111/2014 (15 January 2018),"30.  Sixthly, Ng/Daughter claimed brief fees (HK$150,000 for Mr Chua SC and HK$45,000 for Mr A Tang), conference fees (HK$8,460 for Mr
Chua SC and HK$6,250 for Mr A Tang) and fees for settling summons and affirmation/affidavit (HK$14,000 for Mr Chua SC and HK$34,300
for Mr A Tang). I am not persuaded a conference with counsel would be necessary at all. All that was required prior to the Hearing
as being necessary or proper was for junior counsel to settle Ng’s affirmations, and with proper instructions it would not have
required any conference whether with solicitors alone or with clients as well. It was the nuanced presentation of factual information
in solicitors’ drafts that required counsel’s skilled input, and it was not the function of counsel to gather primary instructions
during conference when costs were claimed for 2 fee-earners for attendance on client and preparation of documents. In particular,
I do not see any need for counsel to settle the summons and GR’s affirmation which was brief and well within the scope of work
and ability of DC/GR. In any event, I do not see any need, on party and party basis, to involve leading counsel for settling affirmation/affidavit. 31.  Taking into account all of the above matters, and upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary
and its costs reasonable” on the sensible standard of necessity as explained by the Court of Appeal, Ng’s/Daughter’s total
costs on their Statement of Costs are assessed at HK$270,000.  Although I have explained in paragraph 7 above why written submissions
on summary assessment of costs should not be considered, having cast a quick eye over the contents of such submissions, I find that
even if I were to take them into account, they would not have swayed me from the above analysis and outcome. 32.

of such nature between family members should be dealt with expeditiously so that hopefully the riftcan be healed as soon as possible.
 In the course of the hearing, I indicated to counsel that should I dismiss the application, I might consider making case management
directions on consolidation and seek the parties’ submissions in that regard. However, on further consideration, given the different
types of consolidation that can be ordered, and to avoid further unnecessary costs, I have decided not to do so at this stage.  I

HKSAR v. INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI [2018] HKCFI 80; [2018] 3 HKC 394; HCCC 318/2017 (17 January 2018),"14.  Against that standard, in my judgement, a jury could draw the inferences that I have outlined above.  The evidence is therefore,
in my judgement, relevant.  It is capable of being a basis upon which a jury could find that the accused had the relevant state of
mind required for the proof of the offence on the indictment. 15.  The second issue is whether the evidence is more prejudicial than probative.  It is plainly probative when taken together with the
other evidence to which I have made reference.  The only remaining issue is whether it is so prejudicial as to place in jeopardy
the fair trial of the accused.  In Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7;  (1995) 182 CLR 461, in the High Court of Australia, McHugh J made the point that: “The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue,
the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial.”  In determining the threat to the fairness of the trial, the issue is whether,
by reason of the reception of this evidence, the jury might somehow be divertedfrom the real issue, or that there is a substantial
risk that the jury might misusethe evidence to the prejudice of the accused.  It would be necessary for there to be a careful direction
on the use (and possible misuse) of circumstantial evidence.  In my judgement, if such a direction is given in the context of a direction
based on WinnieLov HKSAR (above), the fair trial of the accused is not put in jeopardy. 16.  It follows that I decline to exclude the evidence on the basis that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative
value.  I should add that this ruling, which occurs about one third of the way through the prosecution case, and, if the evidence
turns out differently to that which is anticipated, there might be a case which would justify revisiting this objection and my ruling.
 Part of the reason for this is although the material on the mobile phone is not susceptible of changing, part of my reason for concluding
that the impugned evidence is admissible upon the basis that it is relevant and that the prejudicial effect of that evidence is outweighed
by its probative value, that has been done in the context of not only the product of the mobile phone but also the other evidence
in the case.","INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI

PAN SHI LIANG v. HARSEN INDUSTRIES LTD [2018] HKCFI 211; HCMP 1917/2017 (17 January 2018),"4.  The application came before me in November last years.  Although both the Company and Mr Wong had been given notice, no one appeared
at that hearing in opposition.  As a result of the questions I raised, however, the hearing was adjourned to today.  Those questions
have since been addressed, to my satisfaction, in the 3rd affirmation of Mr Pan and in the supplemental skeleton of Mr Leung who has appeared for Mr Pan.  Neither the Company nor Mr Wong
has appeared today to oppose the application.  5.  Since the matter is going forward and no opposing argument has been advanced, I will not go into the substantive claims in detail,
except to say that I accept Mr Leung’s submission, for the reasons he has given, that there are serious issues to be tried, which
is not a very high threshold, and that it appears prima facie to be in the interests of the Company that leave be granted given the remedies claimed are primarily damages and account for profits
which, if granted, would enure to the benefit of the Company.  I therefore grant leave for a statutory derivative action to be brought
and make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the originating summons. 6.  As for costs, I think the applicant should have the costs of the application, but I am minded to order that he be indemnified as
to 75% of the costs of the application by the Company because of certain duplication and wastage of costs having regard to the need
for two hearings, which cannot all be laid at the door of the Company.  So far as the costs of the derivative action are concerned,
I will order that they be paid by the Company out of its assets up to the exchange of lists of documents by way of discovery.  So
far as any further costs of the derivative action are concerned, paragraph 3 of the originating summons is adjourned sine die

However, the defendant has not made full and frank disclosure of its financial resources in evidence, which would be required if
the defendant were to rely on a limitation of its financial means to pay (see HKCP (2018) Vol 1 §13/9/15, citing M V Yorke Motors v Edwards [1982] 1 WLR 444and Law Kwok Hung v Tse Ping Man & Anr [1999] HKCFI 320; [1999] 4 HKC 397 at 407F-I).   45.  Having taken all these matters into account, including the size of the Investment Sum and the defendant’s conduct in these proceedings,
I have come to the view that the defendant should be required to pay into court the sum of HK$1,000,000.00 within 28 days from today

ARJOWIGGINS HKK2 LTD v. SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LTD [2018] HKCFI 93; HCCT 53/2015 (19 January 2018),"34.  If, as the Respondent submitted, there is any right on its part to serve expert evidence in reply, I consider that it is also incumbent
on the Respondent, at the time when it sought directions for filing evidence for the Summons, not only to highlight to the Court
and to the Claimant that it would be serving expert evidence, but also to confer with the Claimant and to agree on a timetable for
the experts to discuss the expert evidence to be addressed, and to identify areas of agreement and disagreement in good time before
the scheduled hearing of the Summons, to be of assistance to the Court.  Having failed so to do, it lies ill in its mouth to complain
of not being given the opportunity to adduce further expert evidence. 35.  In any event, and as a matter of caution, I have considered the further expert evidence sought to be produced and relied upon by
the Respondent.  Suffices it to say that it serves little purpose other than to confirm that the experts do not agree on the nature
of and procedures for derivative actions under PRC law.  As indicated in the earlier part of this Decision, the different views of
the experts on the issues they address under the relevant provisions of the PRC law have little impact on the outcome of the application
for the injunction, which I have granted. 36.  Since the application for leave to adduce expert evidence is too late in time, it is dismissed, with costs to the Claimant.","SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED

LEONG WING SUM v. NG KAI MAN [2018] HKCFI 114; HCA 51/2018 (19 January 2018),"8.  On the other hand, as I informed Mr Lam at the hearing, I consider that the status quo ought to be maintained pending the substantive hearing of the Summons by imposing an interim, prohibitory, injunction to restrain
the Defendant from carrying out any further works on the site.  Mr Lam fairly accepted that the balance of convenience lied in favour
of maintaining the status quo.  Mr Lam also informed the court that should the court be minded to grant such injunction, the Defendant would be willing to offer
an undertaking to the same effect in lieu of an injunction being imposed by the court, although his primary position was that no
interim injunction should be granted. 9.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the parties’ respective positions are best protected by an interim injunction restraining
the Defendant from carrying out any further works on the site pending the substantive hearing of the Summons.  Taking into account
the offer of undertaking by the Defendant, I order that upon (i) the Plaintiff undertaking to comply with any order the court may
make if the court should later find that the order herein has caused loss to the Defendant or any other party and decides that the
Defendant or that other party should be compensated for that loss, and (ii) the Defendant undertaking whether by himself, his servants
or agents or otherwise howsoever, not to carry out or continue any construction works on the Lot pending the substantive hearing

CHINA INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL CORPORATION HONG KONG SECURITIES LTD v. ZHANG JIE [2018] HKCFI 94; HCA 2249/2016 (22 January 2018),"29.  In so far as it concerns the discretion in deciding the priority and timing of liquidation, such a discretion is part and parcel
of the operation of margin loans and is entirely consistent with the provisions of the margin account agreement.  The plaintiff has
explained that “[t]he timing of disposal of collateral is determined by matters such as a client’s loan to value ratio, the timing
of any margin call, the amount of any outstanding loan and the value of collateral”: see the 4th affirmation of Zhou Jiaxing, §10. 30.  The defendant may consider it “unfair” that the 2nd sale took place approximately when the share price had fallen dramatically in the interim.  But unless there is evidence to show
the sale was dishonest or in abuse or not made in good faith, fairness and reasonableness do not come into the picture.  There is
no suggestion that each of those sales were not made at market price.  None of those considerations described by the plaintiff could
be said to be inappropriate, improper or irrelevant when making decisions to liquidate in the context of margin accounts.  No prima facie case of abuse or irrationality concerning the exercise of the plaintiff’s discretion can remotely be discerned from the evidence
before the court. 31.  In my view, the submission that the plaintiff was in breach of the duty is nothing more than “moonshine” and the appeal merited
immediate dismissal.  An order was also made that the Mareva injunction be continued until further order.","ZHANG JIE (張杰)

particularly when L is attending kindergarten on Lantau on Mondays – Fridays, and the present access arrangements are working smoothly.
Further, having considered the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of L not to vary the

other parent advance notice of his/her absence from Hong Kong. 16.  As for costs, the Father said he was seeking a clarification of the Court’s order, and in the end did not file any further affirmation
in support.  As I have said, there was no need for the Mother to file hers.  Having considered the circumstances, I will make no

TOP CATERING DEVELOPMENT LTD v. CHAN SZE NGA FIONA T/A TASTY [2018] HKCFI 111; HCA 1817/2015 (23 January 2018),"12.  Under RHC O 1A r 1, the underlying objectives of the Rules of the High Court are inter alia to ensure that a case is dealt with as expeditiously as is reasonably practicable, to promote a sense of reasonable proportion and
procedural economy in the conduct of proceedings and to ensure that the resources of the court are distributed fairly.  Under RHC
O 1A r 2, the court is obliged to give effect to these underlying objectives when exercising any of its powers.  Under RHC O 1A r
4, the court is further obliged to actively manage cases by inter alia identifying the issues at an early stage and deciding promptly which issues need full investigation and trial. 13.  This court is of the firm view that giving leave to the Plaintiff to adduce the supplemental witness statement of Ng will seriously
undermine the objectives of the Rules of the High Court.  The faked meal tickets are a non‑issue in this case.  They do not require
full investigation and trial.  Allowing the Plaintiff to adduce further evidence on them will serve no purpose except to substantially
prolong the trial — properly investigating the allegation concerning the 189 faked meal tickets (or the 107 faked meal tickets
mentioned in Ng’s police statement) will require much more time than the 6 days allotted for the trial of this case.  In the end,
whatever the result of the investigation will have little bearing on the party’s pleaded claim, defence or counterclaim.  Nor will
it affect the end result of this trial.  Allowing such further evidence and such a pointless investigation is totally contrary to
the objectives of promoting a sense of reasonable proportion and procedural economy in the conduct of proceedings and ensuring the
resources of the court are distributed fairly. 14.  The Plaintiff’s application is wholly unmeritorious and is hereby dismissed.  There will be an order nisi that costs of and occasioned by the Plaintiff’s application be to the Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for

HKSAR v. LAKTHONG SOMSAMAI [2018] HKCFI 96; HCMA 313/2017 (24 January 2018),"15.  Before me, Mr. McGowan has fairly and properly conceded that he was unable to find an authority which can support his argument that
a defendant’s somewhat lower intellectual capacity can ever form a valid basis for discount in sentences as opposed to ill or retarded
mental conditions in the other authorities. 16.  For the above reasons, I disagree with Mr. McGowan when he submitted that there was sufficient basis before the Magistrate for her
to further reduce the sentence on account of the Appellant’s lower intellectual ability.   17.  Accordingly, there is no merit on each ground of appeal advanced by the Appellant and the sentences imposed by the Magistrate were
neither excessive nor wrong in principle.  The appeal against her sentence is therefore dismissed.","LAKTHONG SOMSAMAI

HK$2.02m to the Account on 18 March 2011.  There is no evidence of anything wrongful or unlawful done by the plaintiff to procure
that payment.  In any event, given his liability to the plaintiff on the guarantee, it would be circuitous to set aside the credit
of HK$2.02m only for the Account’s debit balance to be increased by the same amount. 75.  For the above reasons, the defences raised all fail.  The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.  Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff
against both defendants jointly and severally in the sum of HK$24,466,180.31 together with interest from the date of the Writ of

SPRUCE AUSTRALIA PTY LTD v. NEW SENJIA TRADE LTD [2018] HKCFI 101; HCA 2292/2018 (20 December 2018),"17.  In so far as the continuation of the Mareva Injunction is concerned, I repeat what I have said in China Citic Bank Corporation Limited (Quanzhou Branch) v Li Kwai Chun & others [2018] HKCFI 1800 at paragraph 32, that: 18.  In the present case, having considered all the circumstances, the fraudulent nature of the conduct in particular, and the clear
risk of dissipation in the absence of any Mareva relief, I am of the view that the continuation of the Mareva Injunction post-judgment is justified.  I am however not prepared to
leave it open-ended in the manner as sought.  I impose a time limit of 30 June 2019, after which the Mareva Injunction willlapse.
 That will give the plaintiff sufficient time to take out any execution process deemed necessary.  This is however without prejudice
to any application in the future for further continuation should the circumstances justify it. 19.  For the above reasons, and subject to paragraph 18 above, I grant the Orders in terms of the Summons, together with costs of the

HKSAR v. JALLOW PATEH AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 144; HCMA 81/2017 (26 January 2018),"39.  Mr. Sean referred me to HKSAR v DARBOE LANSANA and another HCMA 153/2017 (unreported, 25 July 2017), a magistracy appeal case involving other appellants from Gambia arrested in the same police
operation.  The ground of appeal was that the sentence was excessive by reference to comparable cases in the magistrates’ courts.
In dismissing the appeal, M Poon J refused to have regards to such results in other magistrates’ courts supplied to her ladyship
by the appellants’ counsel, though such were case results of other Gambians arrested in the same police operation.  M Poon J said
she would only have authorities,not case results from magistracies.  Her Ladyship also brought to counsel’s attention to the case
of HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai HCMA 410/2008 (unreported, 26 June 2008).  It is noted that in that case, at para 11, for very small amount of heroin (less than
1 gramme), Saw J adopted the starting point of 2 years.  In the end, M Poon J dismissed the appeal (HCMA 153/2017) as the starting
point adopted by the sentencing magistrate was in line with R v Lau Tak Ming & anor [1990] 2 HKLR 370 and HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai (supra). 40.  In the present appeal, based on the above authorities, there is no doubt that the starting point of 24 months as enhanced by the
Magistrate was in line with the sentencing guidelines and was entirely proper in the circumstances.  As in the case of D1, there
were two separate offences and a partly consecutive sentence with an extra of 6 months’ sentence was therefore just and proper,
taking into account the principle of totality.  I entirely agree with the respondent that there is no merit in the appeal against
the sentences and they were neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive. 41.  Accordingly, the appeal against sentence by D1 and D3 is also dismissed.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 26 January 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/144.html,"

"HKSAR v. PILINOVICS, MARTIN ANTHONY [2018] HKCFI 147; HCMA 510/2018 (21 December 2018)","11.  The appellant has pleaded in this court that he suffers from a delusional disorder as he had been diagnosed in the UK and he said
that he had cut his wrist before coming to Hong Kong on his way to Taiwan to see his fiancée.  However, I do not see how that would
serve as proper mitigation in this case.  The fact is it was an opportunistic theft at the time he took the property from the lift.
 It was an opportunistic burglary when he climbed over the glass wall partition to steal the ticket and not only did he do it once,
he did it twice by climbing over that glass partition again and stealing the printer rolls. 12.  His second ground of appeal is that he asked for leniency to reduce the sentence so that he can go back to the UK to deal with matters
needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence. 13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There
is no merit to this appeal and so the appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

The question which the court will then ask is whether the order for sale would not be beneficial or would cause very great hardship
to the 2nd defendant.  The test is an objective one.  Mr Chan submitted that to determine this question, the Court would have to consider all
the relevant circumstances, including the comparative benefits to the plaintiffs.  Thus, he submitted, if the debts actually have
been paid off or very little, or can be paid off by some other means, the prejudice or the hardship caused to the co-owner would
be larger.  I disagree.  To approach the question, the Court is not required to consider the matter in a comparative approach.  What
the Court has to consider is objectively, whether to the co-owner, it would not be beneficial or would cause great hardship.  Recorder Fok SC did not summarise the test as whether compared with the benefit to be obtained by the applicant, the benefit to the co-owner would be great or not. 8.  It remains for me to add that the present action is not the appropriate forum for the defendants to vent out their grievance.  If
the 1st defendant or even the 2nd defendant has any complaints to make concerning the administration of the property of the 1st defendant, they still have redress.  In particular, there is nothing to prevent them from applying to the Court by appropriate procedure
to give appropriate directions or orders pursuant to its supervisory jurisdiction over the plaintiffs as trustees under sections 83 and 97 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 6).  In this regard, Mr Chan contended that the Court of First Instance, including this court, has the jurisdiction to deal with this
matter because section 2 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance defines “court” as “Court of First Instance sitting in its bankruptcy jurisdiction”.  While I agree that the Court of First
Instance has jurisdiction in general, the question still is whether those complaints raised by the defendants are relevant.  If they
were relevant, they would be considered whether or not certain procedure is complied with under the Bankruptcy Ordinance.  However, since I have ruled that they are irrelevant, I do not need to labour on this point further. 9.

raised. 33.  Having regard to all the matters identified in paragraphs 25 to 32 above, I have come to the inevitable conclusion that Hong Kong
is not the appropriate forum for the trial of this action, and that the judges in the Mainland courts, with their in-depth understanding
and knowledge of the relevant PRC laws, the policy considerations and the practices of the Mainland authorities, would be more familiar
with and be better able to decide the issues in dispute in this case.  The Partners have identified the Shanghai No 1 Intermediate

which is the more appropriate forum, depending on the nature and size of the Plaintiffs’ claim against the Partners. 34.  I accordingly grant the orders sought in the Partners’ summons, to set aside the Order and to stay these proceedings, on the basis

indemnified by Man Lung out of its assets or, alternatively, be paid by Tam personally on an indemnity basis”. 28.  As far as costs of this application are concerned, this court is satisfied that Tang was acting in good faith and had reasonable
grounds for making the application.  Given Tam’s unjustified opposition, there seems no reason why such costs should be paid out
of Man Lung’s assets.  In this court’s view, ordering a company to bear the member’s costs of a proper leave application will
only serve to encourage unjustified opposition by the intended defendant to the proposed derivative action in future.  There shall
be an order nisi that costs of this application be borne by Tam, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel. 29.  As to whether the Court should grant an order that the costs of the derivative action be indemnified out of the assets of Man Lung
or be borne by Tam personally, even Mr Hon recognises, at paragraph 18 of his written submissions, that the Court very often would
defer such determination when the outcome of the statutory derivative action is known or when the position is clearer: Re Grand Field Group Holdings Ltd unrep, HCMP 1059/2008, Kwan J (as she then was) at [50].  I agree and will defer the matter to a subsequent occasion.  There will

CHEUNG PING SUM v. WONG CHI HANG [2018] HKCFI 212; HCA 289/2017 (31 January 2018),"2.  Messrs Tai, Tang & Chong, solicitors acting for the plaintiff, have since written in, seeking an order that either the costs
be summarily assessed in accordance with the statement of costs they provided, or that the costs of and incidental to the Summons
be taxed and paid forthwith.  Messrs Mandy Wan & Co, solicitors acting for the defendant, have also written in.  They opposed
the plaintiff’s application.  The plaintiff and the Court were further reminded of the fact that the defendant is on legal aid.
 They requested the addition to the nisi order words to the effect that the defendant’s own costs be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations. 3.  As the defendant has been on legal aid: 4.  In the circumstances, the application for a forthwith costs order has to be refused.   Given the forthcoming Estate Action trial,
the similarity in the nature of some of the factual issues involved, and the effect of Section 16C(1)(b)(ii), I also do not deem it appropriate to order summary assessment at this stage, but would leave the matter till the end.  I would therefore
simply modify the nisi order as follows, that the plaintiff shall have the costs of this application, to be taxed if not agreed, and the defendant’s own

in closure of account and legal action by the service provider.  Whilst it would not be a desirable situation, it cannot be equated
with diminution of assets.  The proper course was for Ma to negotiate a sensible solution with Hyundai Marine, failing which he might
apply to the court.  He was not entitled to take the matter into his own hands in the face of the Order.  70.  In the premises, there is no doubt that Ma had breached the Restriction on Disposal of Assets in respect of the payment of HK$916,950,

to the claims made by the plaintiff.  30.  As to the Order 14A application, I note that the three questions posed are based on hypothetical assumptions and are not based on

 If I had not considered tracing to be a significant factor, would the balance have tilted in favour of Hong Kong as the appropriate
forum?  The answeris “yes”.  I remain of the view that the other factors set out in paragraph 41are more significant factors
in the context of this case than those relied upon by the 2nd defendant.  I remain of the view that the 2nd defendant failed to establish that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum and that Singapore is clearly or distinctly more appropriate
than Hong Kong and I refer to paragraphs 40 to 44 of my Decision.  For this reason, I consider that the fourth ground of appeal does
not have a reasonable prospect of success. 31.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the defendants’ application for leave to appeal. 32.

In the ultimate analysis, where one is concerned, as here, with innumerable sale and purchase transactions in relation to Qunxing
shares and finite and limited resources for the payment of compensation, a robust approach has to be adopted.  As Deputy Judge Halpern
QC of the English High Court said in Financial Conduct Authority v Anderson [2014] EWHC 3630 (Ch) at §13: 68.  In all the circumstances, I consider that it is desirable, and would not cause unfair prejudice to any person, for the proposed
order to be made under s 213(2)(b).  It is unnecessary to deal with the alternative claim for an order for damages under s 213(8).
 There will accordingly be an order along the lines sought by the Commission as discussed above.  I give liberty to apply in relation
to the precise terms of the order to be made. 69.  For these reasons, there will be declarations and orders as stated above, with an order nisi that the Commission do have the costs of the action, with a certificate for two counsel, to be taxed if not agreed.","2011

andvexatious.  Mr Lau, on behalf of the defendants, contests this on the basis that the defendants were simply contesting and questioning
the Master’s approach.  13.  Appeals against costs orders made by Masters are not to be encouraged and, in appropriate circumstances, indemnity costs orders
should be made.  However, the Master here, in fact dismissed the plaintiff’s application and, in my view, it was not totally without
merit for the defendants to question the approach then adopted by the Master with regard to costs.  As such, I decline an order of
indemnity costs. The plaintiff will have its costs of and occasioned by this appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.  14.  So the order I make is that:",Date of Decision: 6 February 2018(Robert Whitehead SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2018/466.html,"

not have found him guilty. 9.  In relation to the sentence, he said that the sentence was too long and asked for a reduction in sentence.  I have read the learned
magistrate’s Statement of Findings in relation to the conviction, she is the best person to find the facts as she had observed

given reasons as to why she did not believe either the appellant or his witnesses.  I cannot find any error in her reasons for conviction
in law or in procedure and so there is no reason whatsoever to disturb her conviction in this case. 10.

RE THE JOINT LIQUIDATORS OF SUPREME TYCOON LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS) [2018] HKCFI 277; [2018] 1 HKLRD 1120; [2018] 2 HKC 485; HCMP 833/2017 (8 February 2018),"17.  Therefore the mere fact of a foreign liquidation being a voluntary liquidation is no bar to the Hong Kong court recognising and
assisting that liquidation under the principle of modified universalism.  However, if the foreign liquidation is a solvent liquidation
(for instance, a members’ voluntary liquidation), it would not fall within the principle of modified universalism.  A foreign solvent
liquidation is not a collective insolvency proceeding, and is more akin to the “private arrangement” the Privy Council was referring
to.  In this connection, with respect, I agree with Lord Neuberger’s dissenting observations in Singularis.[11] Accordingly, unlike the Singapore court, I would not rely on the US Bankruptcy Court’s decision in In re Betcorp Limited [12] which concerns an Australian members’ voluntary liquidation being recognised under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.  At any
rate, it appears that Betcorp is a controversial decision even from the perspective of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: see Look Chan Ho, Cross-Border Insolvency: A Commentary on the UNCITRAL Model Law,[13] pp 185–189; UNCITRAL Guide to Enactment and Interpretation of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross‑Border Insolvency (2013) at [73]. 18.  In the present case, if the Company’s liquidation in the BVI were a compulsory winding-up, there would be no question that this
Court could recognise the applicants as joint liquidators of the Company and assist them in carrying out their functions.  It follows
from above principles that there is no bar to this Court recognising and assisting the applicants as joint liquidators of the Company,
despite the fact that the Company’s liquidation was commenced by a shareholders’ resolution.  The Company’s liquidation in
the BVI is a collective insolvency proceeding.  In any event, as the applicants are officers of the Supreme Court, though not appointed
as such by the Supreme Court, they probably could be recognised even under the Privy Council’s more restrictive approach in Singularis.[14] 19.  For the reasons I have given, I consider that there is no impediment to granting the recognition order the applicants seek and I
shall so order.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/277.html,"

necessary for the originating summons to be issued.  It is clear to me that the successful party in this case must be the applicant,
and there is no reason why the losing party should not bear the costs incurred on a party and party basis.  7.  I need to mention that the current agreement has come about because the defendant finally decided that she was prepared to agree
to three of the four resolutions passed on 27 November 2014.  Those resolutions dealt with the appointment of auditors, the approval
of audited financial statements, the election of certain individuals to the board and declaring that the defendant was not re-elected
and would cease to act as director effective 27 November 2014.  8.  Having agreed to those resolutions, the originating summons has now been rendered unnecessary but the agreement did not come about

YS v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 201; HCAL 407/2017 (9 February 2018),"37.  COI information is updated from time to time but normally not too drastically or materially.  However, in the case of Sri Lanka,
there must have been obviously reasons for the updates to be material and significant.  I am sure it is unusual for so much COI information
to be updated but it would be prejudicial to the applicant who was in person if the adjudicator did not ensure the information she
relied upon was the most recent.  A check online would ensure this was the case and an up-to-date list of COI information in the
appeal bundle should be endeavoured to be provided to both the applicant and the adjudicator. 38.  In light of the number of publications updated and in light of the material updates themselves, the second ground is reasonably
arguable and has merit. 39.  As a result of my finding above, it is not necessary to go into the merits of ground 3 which essentially was an alternative ground
to the second.  There is a reasonably arguable case on the first two grounds.  Therefore, as there is a realistic prospect of success

review are disposed of on an ex parte basis is the assumption that the applications are properly formulated and presented, with the proposed grounds of judicial review
being clearly, logically and succinctly set out in the Form 86 and properly supported by relevant evidence in the affidavit required
to be filed under Order 53, rule 3(2) of the Rules of the High Court.  Increasingly, however, the court is faced with applications for leave to apply for judicial review which are not properly formulated
or presented, and where the proposed grounds of judicial review are obscure or unintelligible.  The result is that the court cannot
properly deal with the leave applications on an ex parte basis, but has to direct an oral hearing to determine the matter with the assistance of evidence and/or submissions from the putative
respondent in order to do justice to both parties.  The present is such a case. 21.  Ultimately, the principle remains that costs lie in the discretion of the court which must retain the flexibility to make or refuse
to make an award of costs as the particular circumstances of the case and justice warrant.   In determining the question of costs
in this case, I also take into account the following matters:- 22.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the Applicant should pay the EAC’s costs of resisting the two applications, to be taxed

charges  it claimed to be payable under the Agreement.  The institution of 44 was totally contrary to the objectives of the CJR,
with its emphases on promoting procedural economy, cost-effectiveness and fair distribution of the resources of the Court. It was
a waste of legal costs to have 2 separate proceedings on the same subject matter, to seek identical relief to that which was sought
or could have been sought in 3446.  The proclaimed excuse, of avoiding delay, does not justify the institution of separate proceedings,
when Octo’s claims could have been raised by counterclaim, and there is more than ample armory under the Rules of the High Court
for Octo to proceed with its counterclaim expeditiously if it so wished to do.  Octo’s application on 15 August 2017, for the trial
of 3446 and 44 to be heard at the same time or immediately after the other, further contradicts its assertion of a desire to expedite
the trial of 44 without it being delayed by the alleged complexities in 3446. 60.  Octo’s claims for its professional fees on quantum meruit basis are disputed by NTT, but on the evidence available, it cannot be plainly seen that Octo has no arguable cause of action.  Since
Octo chose not to file a counterclaim in 3446, but to institute 44 separately, and as I have granted summary judgment on NTT’s
claims in 3446, I will strike out Octo’s claims in 44 for the balance of the Licence Fee, but will not strike out its claims for
professional fees on quantum meruit.  Judgment will be entered in NTT’s favor on its counterclaim in 44, with the order that the costs of the judgment on the counterclaim
and striking out (of the claim for the Licence Fee) are to be paid by Octo on an indemnity basis, with certificate for counsel. 61.  I further order that the costs of the action in 3446 and of NTT’s summons of 25 July 2017 in 3446 are to be paid by Octo to NTT,
on the usual party and party basis, with certificate for counsel.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/325.html,"

HYUNDAI MERCHANT MARINE (HONG KONG) LTD v. MA CHUN KIT [2018] HKCFI 328; HCMP 1115/2017 (9 February 2018),"26.  Taking the most lenient view for Ma’s benefit, I order that he be committed to prison for 4 months.  He must therefore surrender
himself to the bailiffs who are in court as soon as this hearing is concluded. 27.  There is no dispute that costs should follow the event and that such costs are normally awarded on indemnity basis.  I do not believe

the special issue carefully and made the ruling that the answers were provided by the appellant voluntarily.  In my view, the magistrate,
after detailed assessment of the evidence before him, rightly had properly rejected the evidence of the appellant both on the special
and general issue.  He had seen and heard the witnesses and was entitled to form the view as he did.  Once that interview was admitted,
a conviction is simply inevitable. 13.  The appellant has raised the issue of D2’s interview.  At first, I failed to comprehend why D2’s cautioned interviews were exhibited
at the appellant’s trial.  I accepted explanation by counsel for the respondent at the appeal hearing that those interviews were
left as exhibits after D2’s case was withdrawn on completion of the evidence of two prosecution witnesses.  She conceded that the
better practice was to apply to withdraw D2’s two cautioned interviews immediately upon D2’s discharge since D2 was no longer
on trial and there was no basis for the admission of such as exhibits in the appellant’s trial.  In fact, to the contrary of the
appellant’s submission, answers 14 and 27 in the first of those interviews simply lent no support to the Defence case.  Instead,
they are prejudicial and could implicate the appellant.  The magistrate was correct in paying no heed to the contents of those interviews
in reaching his findings, and had clearly demonstrated such in his Statement of Findings. 14.  I would not have come to a different conclusion had I been the trial magistrate.  There is ample evidence to find that the appellant
did make the representation which was false in a material particular and that the appellant knew the statement to be false.",(M Poon)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/330.html,"

DEVONPORT LTD v. THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 326; HCMP 2775/2017 (15 February 2018),"44.  As is noted in HSBC’s letter of 22 January 2018, a letter from Kennedys to HSBC dated 28 December 2017 threatened proceedings

the following day without giving HSBC an opportunity to respond.  Had the seven day ‘grace period’ been allowed, it is possible
that these proceedings would not have been necessary. 45.  As I have observed, and while it may have taken longer than Murray would have liked, a certain amount of information and documents
have already been obtained from HSBC over several months.  HSBC has also already indicated in correspondence, most recently to the
court on 22 January 2018, that it will not oppose the making of an order requiring that it produce any remaining information and
documents (and has stated that it is already taking steps in this regard).  Accordingly, I order that Devonport pay HSBC the costs
of this action and the costs of compliance with any order made on an indemnity basis and further reimburse HSBC for all other reasonable
costs of compliance with the order, all such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  46.  Finally, I direct that this decision be published after the expiry of 30 days from the date of handing down the decision but I give

for the matter to be “adjourned sine die with liberty to restore on grounds of (1) (2) above”.  For reasons stated above, paragraphs
1 and 2 of the Summons have no merits.  It follows that there is no good reason to grant any extension of time for the Applicant
to serve the notice of appeal based on the matters mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Summons. 7.  Lastly, in paragraph 4 of the Summons, the Applicant seeks an order that there be no order as to the costs of the proceedings. 
The Applicant argues that the court could not deal with the interim relief application prior to the grant of leave to apply for judicial
review.  It should be noted that the hearing on 2 February 2018 was a combined hearing of both the application for leave to apply
judicial review and the application for interim relief.  It is clear from the Decision itself that the application for interim relief
was rejected because the court considered that the application for leave to apply for judicial review was not reasonably arguable
and the Applicant lacked standing in the matter.  The reasons for making the costs order were explained in paragraphs 19 to 21 of
the Decision.  Nothing has been said which convinces me that the costs order was wrongly made.  I should also mention that the costs
order made on 9 February 2018 was not an order nisi. For these reasons, I do not consider that there is any valid ground to vary the costs order previously made. 8.

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. CHEONG KAI TJIEH AUGUSTINE AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 437; HCA 2269/2012 (22 February 2018),"5.  Mr Cheong did raise a technical issue before me, namely, whether or not section 49 of the High Court Ordinance, Cap 4, applies at all to the order made on 13 March 2017, although he accepted that the consent summons necessarily provided that
the judgment rate of interest would be paid for at least the period specified in the summons.  It seems to me quite clear that section 49 does apply to the order.  This is dealt with in the commentary to the Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018: see paras 42/1/6 and 42/1/11.  It seems to me clear that the statutory rate of interest on a judgment applies to a registered order
of the Tribunal from the date on which the order contained in the report handed down by the Tribunal is made. 6.  It is clearly desirable that applications of this sort are dealt with promptly as they will not normally be controversial.  As I
have already indicated, it seems to me that it is not appropriate or necessarily efficient for the applications to be dealt with
in writing, although it is desirable that the parties agree the terms of the order that is sought from the court and that an application
for a short expedited hearing is made in order that the mechanism for implementing the orders of the Tribunal can be made promptly
and, if they involve the payment of money, that interest does not continue to run for an unnecessarily extended period.  7.  I will therefore make an order in the terms of the revised draft handed up by Mr Dawes which updates the interest calculation until
22 February 2018. Interest will, however, continue to accrue until the actual date of transfer, although I anticipate that the Commission
will be able to have the order perfected and the payment out of court made very promptly.",Date of Decision: 22 February 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/437.html,"

claim and settled the matter at the hearing before Master Leong such that allcosts which he was ordered to pay in this action would
not have been incurred and wasted.  This argument is disingenuous.  His challenge about the accuracy was only raised after Master
Leong had entered the Order 88 Judgment.  As Deputy Judge Poon held, his request for statements and records was just a delaying tactic
and that the calculations were correct.  These findings were all upheld on appeal.  His conduct throughout these proceedings indicated
that his sole intention behind his request for bank statements and records was to delay the legal process with his repeated unmeritorious
appeals and applications to stay.  He had no intention to pay.  His argument that had he been given the statements and records he
would have settled the action is artificial and disingenuous.  The legal costs he sought to recover under the wasted costs order
were costs he was ordered to pay for his losing the action. He only had himself to blame for taking such an obstinate course.  Those
costs fall outside the scope of the wasted costs.  25.  The defendant claims the difference between interest on the outstanding amount calculated at judgment rate and the contractual rate.
 He has not advanced any ground for this claim.  In any event, it is outside thescope of the wasted costs order provisions.  There
is no issue about Chan’s conduct which justifies the court’s exercise of its wasted costs jurisdiction. 26.  For the above reasons, there is no evidence that Chan acted improperly or was guilty of misconduct in the prosecution of the proceedings.
 The defendant has failed even to satisfy the court that he has passed first stage required for the court to consider exercising
the wasted costs order jurisdiction.  His wasted costs order application is bound to fail.  Suffice it is to say that to insist to
pursue a cause of action which is bound to fail is a clear abuse of proceedings.  The defendant’s summons should therefore be struck
out as an abuse of the process of the court and with costs to Chan Ning Chun Charles on indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 23 February 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/396.html,"

Having considered all relevant circumstances, including the original contested trial and guilty pleas at a relatively late stage,
it is open to the court to award a less than one‑third discount.  Indeed, the court could not be faulted for considering a discount
of 20% only.  However, I am also aware of the delay by the prosecution in serving the additional expert report.  As such, I intend
to give a 25% discount on plea respectively.  That means that Mr Ma and Mr Ha would serve a period of imprisonment of 45 months.
 I understand that they have already served a sentence of 30 months 12 days for D1 and 31 months 6 days for D2.  Given that they
would have received a full reduction for good behaviour whilst in prison of a further one‑third, the resultant mathematics should
be that neither defendant will return to custody.  If, for some reason, that is not the case, my intention in sentencing Mr Ma and
Mr Ha today is that neither should serve any further time in custody and that the sentence should reflect time served. 38.  I further order D1 to pay $6,391,758 to Deutsche Bank by way of restitution as Deutsche Bank was the employer of D1 at the relevant

with the value of the Property of which the 1st and 2nd Defendants now undertake not to dispose without prior notification.  More importantly, the Plaintiff would have to pay substantial
costs to the Defendants for the discharge application and the related appeal. 11.  The appeal against my judgment will certainly be heard in the near future.  It is unlikely that the Plaintiff will pay the taxed
costs before the appeal hearing.  Taking into account the Plaintiff’s liability for costs, I am of the view that in the event of
a successful appeal, the risk of the Defendants in not honouring the undertaking or to run away after the appeal is extremely small.

the parties agree that they have not referred this Court to Order 16 of the Rules of High Court, which I consider should be the main

MP v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 151; HCAL 367/2017 (28 February 2018),"45.  To invoke the protection of Article 3 or BOR 3 risk, the applicant has to meet two requirements.  The adjudicator here has stated
the test for assessing the persecution risk is virtually the same as that for assessing BOR 3.  He also says when assessing persecution
risk in para 40, I quote “the appellant has (not) suffered severe injury or serious harm which would place him within the criteria of persecution.”  This statement cannot be accurate; an applicant does not have
to have suffered severe injury or serious harm in the past in order to bring himself within the definition of persecution.  It is
true that the most recognised form of persecution is the infliction of physical harm including torture and kidnapping as best examples
but not the only form. 46.  The applicant must establish he has a well-founded fear at the time his claim is being assessed; good grounds for fearing persecution
in the future.  He must establish that he has a subjective fear of persecution and also that the fear is well-founded in an objective
sense.  Evidence of past persecution is one of the effective means of showing that a fear of future persecution is objectively well-founded.
 If there is a pattern of long-standing persecution, then there is a likelihood that the behaviour will continue.  However, severe
injury or serious harm is not a necessary factual element to establish persecution.  This ground is reasonably arguable on both limbs. 47.  Therefore, having heard this ex parte application and submissions, I find the three grounds are reasonably arguable and I give leave to the applicant to judicial review

PROMO INTERNATIONAL LTD v. CHAE MAN TOCK AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 284; HCA 1337/2010 (28 February 2018),"246.  As for costs, P sought indemnity costs of the trial to be paid by Ds and save for the trial, all other costs of this action, including
those previously reserved be paid by Ds to P on party and party basis to be taxed if not agreed.  Mr Leung submitted that Ds’ liability
is unarguable and further Mrs Townsend’s witness statement was provided to Ds back in 2015 and yet no action was taken by Ds to
attempt to agree to any items or to provide their own supporting evidence.  As a result, the trial was unnecessarily lengthened. 247.  Although Ds’ liability is unarguable, P did again rely on the Employment Contract and on the 04.05.07 Letter and did not succeed.
 Further, P had to prove its case on quantum.  The original estimated length of trial was 5 days.  The trial eventually lasted 9
days. 248.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I accept that the trial was unnecessarily lengthened by Ds’ conduct and/or
uncompromising attitude during the trial.  I am prepared to order Ds to jointly and severally pay P’s costs of the trial after
7 August 2017 until conclusion of trial on indemnity basis.  Save for this, Ds are to pay all other costs of this action including
any reserved costs to P and costs for written submissions on party and party basis to be taxed if not agreed.",Date of Judgment: 28 February 2018(Bebe Pui Ying Chu),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/284.html,"

Likewise, it would be efficient and sufficient for GR to peruse the skeleton submissions by Ng’s/Daughter’s counsel. I see no

"JEN KIT JOSEPHINE, THE ADMINISTRATRIX FOR THE ESTATE OF JEN FRANK CHIA HSIANG, DECEASED v. CHAN SAU WAI SHIRLEY [2018] HKCFI 429; HCA 346/2014 (28 February 2018)","36.  I am of the view that Shirley both delayed and did not follow the appropriate procedure as regards bringing forward the challenge
to Jennifer’s appointment and her conduct of the administration of the Father’s estate.  However, the HCMP Action having been
issued, Jennifer does not appear to have made substantial efforts to seek Shirley’s agreement that the action should proceed as
if begun by writ or that it be consolidated with the High Court Action.  As regards procedural matters, it would appear that both
parties were labouring under the same misconceptions. 37.  Therefore, I do not consider that there is any clear ‘winner’ as regards the three summonses before me.  Accordingly, I make
an order nisi that the costs of the three summonses, including the hearing before me, and the costs of the HCMP Action up to date
of consolidation be reserved. On the assumption that, by way of a ‘probate counterclaim’, Shirley renews her claim regarding
the revocation of Jennifer’s appointment, such costs will likely fall to be decided by the outcome of that claim but this will
be a matter for the judge who ultimately decides that issue.  I give leave to any party who seeks a varied costs order to apply in
writing with reasons within 14 days failing which the order will become absolute. 38.  As appears from my decision, the issue between Jennifer and Shirley underlying the hearing before me was which of their respective
claims should be dealt with first at a trial. Seemingly each of them, guided no doubt by their respective legal teams, had previously
seen the sequencing in which their completing claims are dealt with as a matter potentially giving one or the other significant tactical
advantage. However, in the circumstances of this matter, I view any perceived tactical advantage as largely illusory.  But, in any
event, as I made clear to Jennifer and Shirley’s respective counsel, I do not consider that this issue of sequencing is one the
court can and should decide far in advance of even properly particularised pleadings being filed and served.  In due course, the
two having been consolidated, after consolidated pleadings have been filed and served, after witness statements have been filed and
served, and thereby the issues, factual and legal, have been clearly identified, the court will be far better placed to form a view
as to how the issues should be addressed at trial.","FRANKLIN YUEN YUEN JEN

RE GOLDEN GATE INTERNATIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND NURSERY LTD [2018] HKCFI 641; HCCW 210/2017 (28 February 2018),"6.  A debt which is subject to a contingency which cannot arise if the company is insolvent in my view cannot be admitted to proof.
 The reasons for this are apparent from paras 68 to 71 of Lord Neuberger’s decision in Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (No 4) [2017] UKSC 38; [2017] 2 WLR 1497, the facts of which are to the extent relevant apparent from these paragraphs:  7.  If the contingency cannot arise in the event of the winding up and, therefore, cannot be admitted to proof, it is artificial to
characterise the creditor as a contingent creditor.  The correct analysis in my view is that for the purposes of section 179(1) he
is not a creditor at all.  A creditor must be somebody whose debts can properly be admitted to proof even if the debt is valued at
a nominal amount pending a final determination of its value, which may depend on the occurrence of a contingency.  If the claim cannot
properly be admitted to proof at all, the claim cannot sensibly be characterised as a contingent debt.  In order for the debt to
be contingent, there must be some possibility of the contingency occurring.  If necessarily it cannot if a winding-up order is made,
there is no longer a contingency and, therefore, no longer a contingent debt.  8.  For this reason, I conclude that the petitioner is not a contingent creditor or a creditor at all and, therefore, did not have locus to present the petition, which I will therefore dismiss and make a costs order nisi that the petitioner pays the Opposing Contributory’s costs of the petition, and that the Official Receiver’s costs are paid out

C v. S [2018] HKCFI 390; HCMP 929/2017 (1 March 2018),"52.  As set out in paragraph 14 of PDSL 6, the question of separate representation is a balance between the risk of potential harm to
the child if he has no voice in the proceedings, the risk of adverse effects on a child who is reluctant to be drawn into a parental
dispute and the cost and time burden to the courts which increased representation will bring.  Having weighed up the balance and
having considered the long history of intractable dispute between the parties, notwithstanding Mrs Lam’s recommendation, I have
come to the view that it is in N’s best interests to be separately represented by the OS.  In fact, in my view, the OS may also
be able to assist N in receiving mental health/psychiatric treatment. 53.  In light of the above, I will order N to be separately represented by the OS in these proceedings. 54.

On 23 August 2013, I made a further order which addressed an application by the 2nd respondent that there be an inquiry into the damages caused to the 1st and 2nd respondents by the continuation of the appointment of the provisional liquidators for the period from 2 January 2013 to 1 March 2013.
 The 2nd respondent has brought that application on before me today.  The petitioners have not attended.  3.  The only damages that are sought today are the provisional liquidators’ costs and disbursements for the period from 2 January

by the petitioners, as I accepted that at least from 2 January 2013 it was no longer necessary for there to be provisional liquidators
given certain undertakings that had been offered by the 2nd respondent. Essentially what I am being asked to do today is, for the same reasons, to direct that the costs that had been incurred
to the Company, the order appointing the provisional liquidators providing as is normal that in the first instance the provisional
liquidators’ costs and disbursements be paid out of the assets of the Company, now be paid by the petitioners. It seems to me that
that is the correct order to make in the circumstances and I will so order. 4.  So far as the costs of today’s application are concerned, it necessarily follows that the petitioners should pay the 2nd respondent’s costs. It seems to me that as the petitioners have made no effort to agree an order, and the 2nd respondent being put to the what should have been unnecessary time and expense of preparing what might have been a contested application,
those costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 1 March 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/492.html,"

the facts were such that he could not but to admit.  48.  Mr How asks for an unspecified term of imprisonment.  Recalcitrant as the Respondent is, this is not the worst type of case that
calls for such a draconian measure.  The applicant’s claim in the main action from which this contempt arose is about $3.5 million.
 It is not a proprietary claim and the applicant is not entitled to tracing.  There is nothing to suggest that the applicant would
suffer additional damage if the contempt is not purged.  Some disclosure has, somehow, been made and bank accounts identified, from
which some recourse could be made.  A fixed term imprisonment with liberty to apply for a review upon the contemnor’s purging the
contempt is appropriate. 49.  The contempt, as I have found, was willful and contumelious.  The Respondent’s conduct was recalcitrant.  I consider a starting
point of twelve months’ imprisonment appropriate.  The Respondent’s admission deserves some mitigation, but that is more than
wiped off by the aggravating factor I mentioned above.  Accordingly, I pass a sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment which shall
take into account the time he was remanded in custody pending sentence.  This sentence is to be served consecutively to the sentence
of 28 days’ imprisonment for common assault which he is currently serving.  I also order costs against the Respondent on indemnity

 The alternative is that the matter goes to taxation with the incurring of yet further expense. 35.  On the whole, I think that this is a case for a summary assessment but, as I have said, given that the court has declined to make

full arguments in Lai Shui Yin and Chow Heung Wing before I decided and confirmed respectively my view that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove the subjective element.  I
had given reasons why I was of the view that the HK situation is different from that of the UK.  I therefore did not follow the exact
wordings of the Specimen Directions for GNM in both Lai Shui Yin and Chow Heung Wing, but made adjustments to the Specimen Directions as required by the particular circumstances of both cases, incorporating the subjective
element. 40.  As to the defence submissions on the relevance of the defendant’s subjective state of mind in GNM cases generally, I do not think
there is any dispute that even in the English cases, the subjective state of mind, if present, can and should be taken into consideration
by the jury.  I have already ruled in Lai Shui Yin that a person who genuinely did not perceive an obvious and serious risk of death should not be exposed to conviction for a serious
crime as manslaughter on the strength of what someone else would have appreciated, therefore it was not enough for the prosecution
to simply rely on the objective reasonable man test, with the judge directing the jury to take into consideration the defendant’s
subjective state of mind both for and against him. 41.

HKSAR v. CHEUNG KA LUN [2018] HKCFI 538; HCCC 265/2017 (9 March 2018),"11.  In respect of the resisting a police officer offences, sentences obviously vary depending on the nature and degree of the offending
involved.  But whatever the circumstances, the courts take very seriously any form of disrespectful behaviour towards a police officer
lawfully carrying out his duties, particularly when such disrespectful behaviour involves acts of violence and aggression.  In such
circumstances, sentences in this kind of case carry a heavy deterrent element.  In the present case, the defendant was arrested by
the police officers and he violently struggled and resisted them, causing some injuries to the officers involved even though such
injuries were of a minor nature.  The approach the courts take in respect of such offences was explained in HKSAR v LIU Lin-feng, CACC 206/2011, 28 February 2012, unreported, at paragraph 55, where the following quoted passage from Secretary for Justice v Ko Wai Kit [2001] HKCA 3; [2001] 3 HKLRD 751, at 758, was relied upon. 12.  This quoted passage should be considered in light of other cases where shorter terms of imprisonment have been imposed where the
nature of the resistance or any resultant injury to the police officer is of a minor nature.  The Court in LIU Lin-feng considered a starting point of 4 ½ months’ imprisonment entirely appropriate where the applicant resisted several police officers
who sustained minor injuries, not dissimilar in nature to the injuries sustained by the police officers in the present case.  I will
adopt the same starting point of 4 ½ months’ imprisonment on each of Counts 2 and 3, which I reduce by one third for the defendant’s
guilty plea, thereby resulting in a sentence on each count of 3 months’ imprisonment.  13.  Taking into account the totality principle, I order that the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 be served concurrently and that 2 months
of the concurrent sentences of 3 months on Counts 2 and 3 be served consecutively to the term of imprisonment of 7 years and 8 months’
imprisonment on Count 1.  This results in a sentence of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/538.html,"

ACROPOLIS LIMITED SUING ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ALL OTHER SHAREHOLDERS IN AESO HOLDING LTD AND ANOTHER v. W&AMP;Q INVESTMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 510; HCA 1496/2017 (12 March 2018),"4.  The parties’ views on the length of the trial vary. These estimates are necessarily rough given the preliminary stage of the proceedings.
Acropolis thinks that seven weeks should be allowed excluding the Counterclaim it proposes is stayed.  As I understood Mr Tong, he
is of the view that this would be sufficient to address the Counterclaim and it might be possible to conclude all issues in a shorter
period.  5.  It is desirable that the Petition is determined promptly in order that the Company’s status can be resolved, because it seems
to me highly likely that if the listing was achieved through a fraudulent placement the Exchange will cancel it, if not I assume
that the Company’s shares can recommence trading.  I note in passing that determining what is the appropriate relief if the court
finds the placement was fraudulent will require some care and a consideration of the interests of innocent minority shareholders.
It seems to me that the quickest and most efficient manner for the proceedings to continue will be for the Petition and the HCA to
be tried together before the same judge, but that there be a split trial.  The issues other than the Counterclaim will be tried first
and in respect of those issues there should be a speedy trial.  The Counterclaim will be tried subsequently.  The timetable for the
Petition and the HCA should be synchronised.  There are already extensive directions in the HCA that were made by Chu J on 25 September
2017 and varied by Master Au-Yeung on 21 December 2017 dealing with all interlocutory stages up to and including witness statements
and experts reports.  They did not, I assume, take into account the Counterclaim.  I will direct that a further CMC takes place to
consider whether the directions already made need to be changed to reflect the introduction of the Counterclaim and my order that
there be a split trial. 6.  I will make the following further directions largely directed to the Petition, which are substantially agreed by the parties:",Date of Decision: 1 February 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/510.html,"

The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 34.  In the case, it took the police a substantial period of time to gather evidence, particularly the CCTV footage at various locations.
 Apparently, it also took them considerable time and effort to scrutinise such CCTV footage to reconstruct the entire process of
how the appellants and the other defendants tailed Mr Chu.  Such evidence provided great assistance to the court and was a manifestation
of the high degree of professionalism and impartiality with which the police investigated the case.  The appellant and his accomplices,
whether for political or other reasons, tailed Mr Chu.  Because of their foolish conduct, the police had to mobilise substantial
manpower and material resources to carry out an investigation at the expense of considerable public funds, and the appellant now
has a conviction at a young age.  The appellant and the public should learn a lesson from this case.",Date of Judgment: 12 March 2018(Joseph Yau),Judge of the Court of First Instance,/2018/546.html,"

"
HKSAR v. YAN SIN MAN [2018] HKCFI 582; HCCC 19/2018 (12 March 2018),"10.  It may well be that the assertion that the defendant had been engaged in drug trafficking at the time of her arrest is implicit from the fact that she had in her possession at that time a notebook and a mobile phone containing the relevant entries
and photographs—on the assumption, of course, that the jury is satisfied that the defendant knew of the entries and the photographs.  But the difficulty for the prosecution is that the truth of that assertion is dependent on the
transactions referred to in the entries in the notebook and the photographs in the mobile phone having taken place—in just the
same way as the betting slips in Or Suen Hong could only have been evidence that the defendant had engaged in bookmaking if the bets purportedly recorded as having taken place had taken place.  They had to have been real transactions
if they were to be evidence of anything other than that the room in which the drugs were found had been the venue at which drug trafficking
had taken place, or as in Or Suen Hong that the room in which the betting slips were found had been the venue at which bookmaking had taken place.  Evidence that these
had been real transactions could not have been given without the prosecution calling the “maker” of the entries or the photographs,
and without such evidence the entries and the photographs are inadmissible for the purpose for which the prosecution proposes to
rely on them on the basis that they contravene the rule against hearsay.  It follows that the entries in the notebook and the photographs
in the mobile phone may not be admitted in the course of the trial. 11.  I have not overlooked what McWalters JA said on this topic at [91] in his separate judgment.  He said: 12.  In the interests of completeness, I should add two things.  First, the Court of Appeal referred to the “maker” of the photographs—as
if the photographs had been taken by someone using the mobile phone.  That is true of the photograph of the receipt, but the prosecution’s
case in fact is that all the other photographs were sent via WhatsApp from the mobile phone to someone who the prosecution is not able to identify.  However, that does not help on how they got onto the mobile
phone in the first place—whether they were sent to the mobile phone by someone or whether they were taken on the mobile phone.  If they had been sent to the mobile phone rather than taken on it, that might have been another reason for holding that the photographs were hearsay.  Secondly,
everything I have said so far about the photographs in the mobile phone does not include the photograph of the receipt for the rent.
However, Mr Andrew Raffell for the prosecution has acknowledged that the prosecution cannot rely on that photograph.  That is because
the Court of Appeal held at [76] that the trial judge should have “directed the jury to disregard entirely the evidence of the
photograph of the receipt” on the basis that it “had no probative value”.",Date of Ruling: 12 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/582.html,"

by way of an affirmation from Ng Ka Man Carmen, an executor officer of the TCAB dated 10 January 2018 that a committee is in the

 It would appear that the issue is being addressed and does not require the courts to consider a declaration. 19.  I agree with Mr McCoy that the tone of the adjudicator and the failure of the adjudicator to acknowledge what the applicant had
said and deal with it properly and fairly means the adjudicator did not adhere to a high standard of fairness and there was not only
an error of law made but procedural irregularity.  The adjudicator dealt with the applicant’s well‑being in a most perfunctory

I will reluctantly grant a stay pending appeal conditional upon Otto3’s payment into court within 14 days from today of 50% of

agree with the submission by the respondent that the complaint was unfounded and in my view, it was just a matter of expression and
interpretation by the Magistrate.  There is no doubt that all the Magistrate was trying to say was that the only possible inference
he can draw was employment as there was not even an iota of evidence which indicated any other alternative relationship.  The Magistrate
has not reversed the burden of proof as contended by the appellants.  Accordingly, this ground also fails. 40.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that the there is no substance nor any merit in any ground of appeal advance on behalf of the
two appellants.  The inference that the two appellants were taking employments at the material times was one the Magistrate was fully
entitled to draw in light of the circumstantial evidence in this case.  Despite the able submissions made on the appellants’ behalf,
I find no basis to interfere with the Magistrate’s finding of facts and the conclusion that he has reached.  41.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed. ",Date of Judgment: 14 March 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/534.html,"

said that the challenge was improperly mounted.  The defence was in fact successful in obtaining a ruling that Mr William Chui was
not permitted to give opinion on the law.  With the concession made by the Prosecution during the hearing of the submissions, it
then became clear on what basis the Prosecution intended to rely on the GMP guidelines.  As a result of this Court’s ruling on
the limited use of these guidelines, D1 and D2 produced documents relating to GMP guidelines in their defence. 66.  In these circumstances, I do not agree that D1 and D2 had unjustifiably challenged the relevance of the GMP.  D1 and D2 will not

LAM KIN CHUNG v. SOKA GAKKAI INTERNATIONAL OF HONG KONG LTD [2018] HKCFI 747; [2018] 2 HKLRD 769; [2018] 4 HKC 489; HCMP 1002/2017 (15 March 2018),"19.  The originating summons seeks as is conventional an order that the applicant be indemnified his costs of the proceedings to be commenced
on behalf of the Company.  This application I will adjourn until I have information about the likely costs and the ability of the
Company to indemnify the applicant.  The parties should agree directions for the determination of this issue.  20.  So far as the costs of the originating summons are concerned in my view the applicant has been substantially successful.  I determined
the application in November 2017 in his favour and he has obtained leave to continue with the proceedings in respect of the two major
claims.  The two claims in respect of which I have refused leave would have added little to the costs of the action.  I will make
an order nisi that 95% of the costs of the originating summons be paid by the Company to the applicant with a certificate for two counsel. 21.  The Company wishes to appeal my decision of 2 November 2017 and an issue has arisen as to whether leave to appeal is required and,
if so, whether time for making the application has expired.  The issue that I decided is one of some general importance and on the
assumption that it is necessary I will grant leave and extend the time for appealing until 12 clear days after the handing down of

TIGER RESORT ASIA LTD v. KAZUO OKADA AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 472; HCA 3017/2017 (16 March 2018),"29.  The authorities mentioned above have stated that the power for inspection under section 21 should be exercised with great caution.
 I agree.  The privacy of the account holder, and banker/customer confidence have to be respected.  I have indeed approached the
application with great caution. I have taken into account the fact that neither the 4th defendant norSkyrise has been served at this stage.  I have on the other hand considered carefully the evidence as set out above,
which included an Investigation Report prepared by the Special Investigation Committee set out by UE.  I have considered the directions
of the remittances or transfers involved, the amounts of those sums, and their time proximity.  On the face of pleadings and as supported
by the affirmatory evidence before me, there is a clear prima facie case of breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the 1st defendant, and knowing receipt or assistance by the other defendants (including Skyrise).  The allegations are serious, and the total
amount involved was substantial. The records which the plaintiff are seeking to inspect are highly relevant.  The scope of the order
which the plaintiff is now seeking has been narrowed down and specifically defined. I have also taken into account the neutral stance
adopted by 1st defendant.  There is no evidence suggesting that the 1st defendant, the 4th defendant or Skyrise would suffer any damage on top of the limited infringement of their banker / client confidence.  I am in all
the circumstances satisfied that an order in terms of the summons as has been narrowed down ought to be made.  30.  The discussions above are confined to the limb of the application under section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance.  Given my conclusion expressed above, there is no need for me to consider the other limb of the application under the inherent jurisdiction
of the court.  I will just add this.  That jurisdiction to order disclosure by a third party is well established.  It is both wider
than section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance (in the sense that it is not confined to banker’s records), and at the same time narrower (in the sense that it is a power developed
in aid of proprietary or tracing claims) - see Norwich Pharmacal Company v Customs & Excise Commissioners [1973] UKHL 6;  [1974] AC 133 and Bankers Trust Company v Shapira [1980] 1 WLR 124.  Some specific limits on that jurisdiction have also been developed—see Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim (No 5) [1992] 2 All ER 911, A Co v B Co [2002] HKCFI 1080; [2002] 3 HKLRD 111, and CTO (HK) Ltd v Li Man Chiu  [2002] HKCFI 591; [2002] 2 HKLRD 875.  In the present case, the plaintiff’s claim is a proprietary one involving tracing.  The evidence in my view demonstrates a real
prospect that the information sought may lead to the location or preservation of assets to the claim.  The order sought is specific.
 The balance tips in favour of me exercising my discretion granting the order.  If required, I would also have granted the application
pursuant this common law jurisdiction which the courts possess. 31.  I grant the application as narrowed down.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 16 March 2018(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/472.html,"

on the Internet except for section 161 of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap 200, and the established criminal offences that are normally available. Section 161 concerns “access” to a computer with criminal or dishonest intent. More particularly, there does not seem to be any statutory,
regulatory, or administrative provisions delineating legal obligations and responsibilities on owners and operators of social mediums
and social networking sites. 46.  The owners and operators of social mediums and social networking sites in which criminal activities take place bear greater responsibility
for the enforcement of the law in its most fundamental terms.  From what I have been told, it seems that they are not doing enough
to prevent and report crime or protect the young and vulnerable.  Improper and criminal conduct on the Internet should not be the
sole responsibility of the law enforcement agencies or relevant government departments or bodies concerned with the protection and
welfare of the public.  The operators and owners of social mediums and social networking sites also have an important role to play.
 47.  As we have warning signs on our streets and products alerting us to potential hazards or dangers, or reminding us of the law or
of our legal responsibilities, it would seem that at the very least we should have such warning signs in cyberspace where required.
 This is but one of many measures that may be available to address the problem.  Solving this problem will not be easy but it needs
to be addressed, and by appropriate persons and bodies that can make an informed and constructive set of recommendations that hopefully
will deal with and arrest the increasing victimisation of the young and vulnerable on the Internet.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/604.html,"

was on them to prove Ds’ contempt beyond reasonable doubt, bearing in mind Ps’ case throughout was that the Gift was a sham and
that Mr Chun was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Chung Shing HK and the 2 Mainland subsidiaries.  Although the Fung Report was
deficient and Ds did not provide confirmation of any matters as required under the 17.08.15 Order, Ps should have been aware that
committal should be a last resort.  They should have considered other alternatives rather than proceeding with the contempt proceedings
against Ds which turned out to be fruitless.  In fact, in the 18.11.16 Judgment, this Court found that in light of the Receivership
Order, there was an alternative way or a viable alternative for Ps to procure the necessary information through the Receivers appointed

Mr Richard Millet QC’s opinion is that, as a matter of BVI law and under the BVI Court Order:- 34.  Even I were to admit the Plaintiff’s expert evidence and accept the above propositions as a matter of BVI law, it would not affect
my conclusion on the Third Disclosure Application, because the question that I have to decide is not whether the 5th Defendant is acting within the powers conferred by the BVI Court Order, or its directors have actual or ostensible authority, to
oppose the application, but whether I should exercise my discretion to order RSRB to disclose the information and documents sought
by the Plaintiff.  I would have come to the same conclusion with or without the participation of the 5th Defendant.  I would only add that, as stated by the Court of Appeal, the 5th Defendant is not bound, at least as a matter of Hong Kong law, to adopt a neutral stance in respect of interlocutory applications
that may directly concern or affect its interest (see paragraph 24 above).  I do not consider the 5th Defendant to be acting improperly in resisting the present application by the Plaintiff. 35.

If an appellant appeals pursuant to section 113, section 114 states that the appellant shall give his notice of appeal in writing to the magistrates’ clerk within 14 days after his conviction,

it appears even for an appeal against order or determination, Form 101 and 102 are the proper forms under the Magistrates Ordinance. 77.  I am aware that under section 80 of the CPO, of Part IV of the CPO, the term “sentence” includes any court order in dealing with an offender, including a hospital
order.  Also, section 83M & 83N are specifically provided for an appeal against a section 75 finding of disability.  However, the section does not apply to a magistrate’s section 75 determination (section 83M(4)).

HUNING IMPORT &AMP; EXPORT CO LTD v. HUNING LTD [2018] HKCFI 611; HCA 1228/2014 (20 March 2018),"140.  Throughout the years, HL’s very substantial debt of about $8 million was gradually reduced to $1,227,013 by accounting manipulations.
 In 2004, a very profitable logistic business was created forto serve HIECL which HIECL could have operated on its own.  By consciousdecision,
HIECL passed a resolution to pay HL exorbitant handling charges of $280,000 per year for the use of its banking facilities which
it could also have obtained by mortgaging the two car parking spaces and use of trust receipts facilities.  A very substantial debt
of $4,704,868.64 was treated as having been repaid by accounting manoeuvre without HL or any of its four directors contributing funds
to make the payment.  These accounting manoeuvres only brought about internal reallocation of assets within two companies.  They
served no commercial purpose except to reduce HL’s debtowed to HIECL.  141.  Despite the substantial debt, HL with its banking facilitieswas used as the treasury of the family business. The assets of HL were
used freely for the purpose of HIECL, including funds and trading-in of HL’s Toyota Alphard.  The logistic business was then transferred
to HIECL in 2007 for no consideration, shortly before the split, to insulate that asset from possible execution in a pending litigation.
 This shows that the assets of the two companies are treated as common or mutual assets.  Though the two companies were separate
legal entities, all these indicate that they formed an integral part of the same family business.  If they were truly separate entities,
HIECL could have allowed HL to be wound up in 1998 on failing to pay compensation to the property developer.  From the accounting
treatment of the accounts of these two companies and Chui’s own evidence, I find that until the split, these two companies were
operated as integral parts of one family business.  The debt incurred in 1998 was also the debt of the family business.  142.  When HL’s debt owing to HIECL is viewed against the above background, I have no difficulties to draw the inference that from the
time it was created in 1998, there was no intention that it shall be repaid as if it were a debt contracted at arms’ length.  All
repayments since the creation ofthe debt were just accounting manipulations or internal asset redistribution for business purposes,
such as bookkeeping or tax avoidance.  In the course of discussion about the split, Joe readily agreed to HIECL waiving the debt.
 His agreement is another confirmation of this common intention.  As for HL’s acknowledgment of the debt in its audited report
for the year ended 31 March 2009, Chung Yee explained that he was bound to make the acknowledgement because the debt could not be
removed save by synchronized act of both companies.  Obviously, HIECL was not prepared to take synchronized action.  Indeed, it even
sought to enforce the debt.  I accept his explanation.  Accordingly, I find that the common intention of HL and HIECL was and has
always been that the debt need not be repaid.  For the above reason, HIECL’s claim is dismissed with costs.","Total:

it or in the course of consulting and giving instructions to his lawyers.  It is even more unlikely that he would not have been given
some explanation by his lawyers as to what a statutory demand was, what its legal significance was and what he should do about it.
 Yet, Mr Xiao told this court he did not look at the statutory demand nor did anyone explain it to him.  He also told this court
he could not remember whether he and his secretary brought the statutory demand to see his lawyers or whether his lawyers told him
what the statutory demand was.  In so far as Mr Xiao wishes to bolster up his counsel’s alternative case that, in any event, he
did not understand what Mr Cheng meant when he said “係statutory demand” and that he had no knowledge of the nature of the document
that Mr Cheng handed to him, he fails. 28.  To conclude, this court is satisfied that on 18 November 2016, Mr Xiao was personally served with the statutory demand.  His opposition

TOHKOH JUSHI CO LTD v. THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 656; HCMP 184/2018 (21 March 2018),"1.  In proceedings HCA 2014/2017, the applicant, a company incorporated in Japan, claims that a Japanese businessman fraudulently misrepresented
to it that an order had been placed for the purchase of equipment, when in truth no such order had been placed. That had induced
the applicant to pay sums in excess of 400 million Japanese yen, which is about HK$28 million, to another company in Japan, and those
sums were eventually paid into the bank accounts in Hong Kong of two companies incorporated in Hong Kong. By this application for
a Norwich Pharmacal order, the applicant applies for an order requiring the bank in which the two accounts are maintained to produce various documents
relating to those accounts, so that it can discover whether the funds are still in those accounts, and if not, to whom they have
been transferred. 2.  So far as I can tell, and Ms Jacqueline Chan for the applicant agrees, what is sought is a Norwich Pharmacal order in the standard form, though unusually perhaps, judgment has already been given, admittedly by default, against one of the
two companies for the whole sum which the applicant claims to have been defrauded of.  The bank does not contest the application.
    3.  I am satisfied that the requirements for the making of a Norwich Pharmacal order have been met in this case. There is cogent and compelling evidence which demonstrates that serious tortious conduct has taken
place.  The order is very likely to reap substantial and worthwhile benefits for the applicant, in that it will be in a much better
position to trace its funds.  And the order is drafted in such a way as to make the production sought no more than is reasonably
necessary to assist the applicant in discovering the whereabouts of its funds.  I therefore make the order sought in paragraphs 1-6
of the originating summons, with the minor drafting amendments I have made to it and to the schedule to it. ",Date of Decision: 21 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/656.html,"

XU BEI v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 636; HCMP 1200/2017 (22 March 2018),"18.  Under such circumstances, there could be no question about rectification of the Companies Register in relation to these matters.
 The only question is about removal of the documents filed by SIL and SRML.  Section 42(4) provides that the court must not order the removal of any information unless it is satisfied that: 19.  If a document showing the rectification is filed in the Companies Register, the continuing presence of the documents filed by the
Unauthorized Directors as such would not cause material damage to the Company.  However, I accept the applicant’s argument that
these documents should be viewed against the scheme as a whole.  They were filed pursuant to an elaborate scheme to extinguish the
shares of the lawful owners and to exclude the Original Directors from management of the Company.  The continuing presence of these
documents might cause intangible damage to the Company.  Investors, lenders and people dealing with the Company might view the propriety
of the conduct of the Company and its directors with suspect and might be weary of their authority as its directors and officers
representing the Company.  People intending to deal with the Company might be deterred bythe sight of these documents and might speculate
if there is anything untowardgoing on in the Company or within its management.  There is a real risk that material damage to the
Company might result by keeping these documents in the Companies Register.  The documents are fraudulent and created with intent
to deceive.  They should never have been registered and kept in the Companies Register and should cease to continue to be kept there.
 On the other hand, I cannot see how SIL, SRML or any other person could arguably have any interest in the continuing appearance
of these inaccurate or forged documents and the inaccurate information contained therein in the Companies Register.  The balance
is in favour of their removal than rectification of the information in the Register. 20.  Accordingly, I make an order that the Registrar of Companies do remove the nine documents stated in paragraph 1 of the originating
summons.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision: 22 March 2018( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/636.html,"

CLA ENGINEERING LTD v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 626; HCMP 273/2018 (23 March 2018),"30.  I am prepared to abridge CLA’s time for serving its inter partes summons, because there is no reason to suppose that it was not just overlooked.  I assume that CLA’s legal team thought that the
issue of the originating summons returnable on 16 March was sufficient.  In any event, no prejudice was suffered by Leighton.  Mr
Zimmern was able to marshal all his arguments despite having insufficient notice of the filing of the summons.  The same applies
to the amendment of the summons.  I give leave for the summons to be amended.  I imagine that the desirability of claiming the alternative
relief was only appreciated when Mr Kat joined CLA’s legal team, and again Mr Zimmern was able to deal with the amendment. 31.  However, for the reasons I have endeavoured to give, I discharge the order made by Deputy Judge To, and I dismiss CLA’s applications
for (a) a new order in the terms of the previous one or (b) an order in the terms of the alternative relief sought by CLA.  At the
conclusion of the hearing, I continued the order of Deputy Judge To until judgment on the summonses before me was handed down in
order to maintain the status quo for the time being.  It goes without saying that the continuation of the order for these few days does not affect the dismissal of
CLA’s applications. 32.  I turn to costs.  At present I see no reason why CLA should not pay to Leighton its costs of and occasioned by both summonses, to
be taxed if not agreed, and I make an order nisi to that effect. However, I am not inclined to order that those costs be taxed on the indemnity basis.  There is no reason to think
that this was a deliberate attempt to steal an unfair march on Leighton.  On the contrary: there is every reason to suppose that
there was here a genuinely, albeit misguided, belief that there was nothing more to disclose than what was being disclosed. ",Date of Judgment: 23 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/626.html,"

"CHINA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (IN LIQUIDATION) v. KPMG (A FIRM) [2018] HKCFI 655; HCA 2276/2016 (23 March 2018)","68.  Be that as it may, as I have found above, KPMG is largely responsible for the present state of affairs by reason of their obstructive
and uncooperative conduct, in particular, their refusal to comply with the Section 221 Orders.  The Liquidators are forced to accept
the unlawful restriction in their investigation imposed on them and to progress at snail pace.  KPMG’s conduct is inviting the
multiple extensions.  KPMG now wishes to take advantage of its own wrong to seek to abridge the current validity period of the protective
writs and force service of the protective writs seven months before their expiry.  The net result would be to force CMED into litigation
before the Liquidators are satisfied that it is the proper course to take and to stand the risk of losing the actions or to abandon
them altogether.  I can in no way find it would be just to abridge the validity of the protective writs.  69.  Mr Hollander also criticised the Liquidators’ change of stance.  He said that initially the Liquidators were receptive to KPMG’s
suggestion for the parties to invoke the Mutual Arrangement mechanism, but later rejected the suggestion and insisted on enforcing
the Section 221 Orders.  I can see nothing wrong with the change of stance.  The express purpose of KPMG’s invoking the Mutual
Arrangement mechanism, as the Liquidators now appreciate, is to circumvent the Section 221 Orders and Lok J’s Extension Order.
 Given the history in this case, particularly that the Liquidators are investigating into potential claims against KPMG and KPMG’s
attitude in obstructing the investigation, it is not unreasonable to surmise that the real purpose of the exercise is to cause or
force service of the protective writs and then filing of statements of claim before the Liquidators are able to present a proper
case and then strike them out altogether.   There are good reasons for the Liquidators to be cautious. 70.  For the above reasons, I dismiss KPMG’s application with costs to CMED and to be paid forthwith.",Date of Decision: 23 March 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/655.html,"

of all statements, records and reports made as a consequence of police activity between 8/9 October 2008 to the point when the police
were ultimately forced to release the containers.  Up to the fifth day of this seven-day trial that had not taken place.  When the
plaintiff’s solicitors gave notice by letter dated 26 February 2018 — almost a decade after the material events — that the
police were to provide copies of all reports, statements etc and produce the originals at trial, they were met with the following
reply from the Department of Justice, which I set out verbatim, in a letter also dated 26 February 2018: 102.  The department’s comment about the lateness of the request is irrelevant.  Its obligation dated from the discovery stage of this
action, years ago.  True it is that a suspicious, mistrustful legal representative of the plaintiff might have been alerted to the
serious deficiency on the defendants’ part — and in my judgment entitled to be so, especially in the light of the subsequent
behaviour of the police and the Department of Justice — but it might equally have been the case that the police failed abysmally
to do things properly and in accordance with regulations and proper practice, as part of a cover-up, or, equally to be condemned,
total disregard for individual rights and common-sense.  I had cause to call in question the department’s sense of what is fair
and good sense in a decision I made in Chan Chuen Ping v Commissioner of Police [2013] HKCFI 1915; [2014] 1 HKLRD 142 (19 November 2013), as yet unreported. 103.  This current instance demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the requirements of litigation as well as individual entitlements
and nothing has been learnt from my decision referred to, or even the basic requirements of civil procedure.  The consequence was
that two whole days were lost whilst the documents were supplied and copied.  Even the defendants’ own counsel was unaware of their
existence.[1] As it transpired none of the documents made any difference to the nature and substance of the case against the defendants, but simply
recorded the consistent and persistent steps to keep the containers away from the plaintiff until eventually and belatedly all of
them were handed over to the plaintiff, though not without intervening traumas and further obstruction.","Containers 5, 6, 7 and 8:

KWOK SIN HO v. WA KWOK ALSO KNOWN AS KWOK WA [2018] HKCFI 612; HCA 903/2014 (28 March 2018),"179.  To conclude, it is my finding that more probable than not that D had paid for the Purchase Costs, namely a sum totaling HK$28,688
and this is the extent of his payments, and I find all other amounts, whether monthly mortgage instalments, early repayments towards
principal of the Mortgage Loan, Discharge, or Ongoing Expenses were made by P.  Ms Leong and Mr Chan agreed that the total purchase
price plus the miscellaneous expenses was HK$268,563.15 and thus the amount of HK$28,688 paid by P was about 10.68%. 180.  I therefore find that the Property has been held by P and D in joint names on trust as to 89.32% for P, and 10.68% for D.  D should
bear 10.68% the expenses of the rates and government rent since date of completion of the purchase of the Property and should continue
to bear 10.68% of such expenses and any future maintenance expenses relating to the Property but excluding management fees and utilities
which should be borne by the occupier, and in this case P. 181.  As P is largely the successful party, D should pay P’s costs of this action, to be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations, if not agreed.

in an appropriate case, and that (on the basis that I was assured that all three counsel previously engaged would continue to be
instructed for the appeal) there is no reason to think that the strength and development of the local bar would be adversely affected

May 2017 decision of refusing to commence criminal investigation on the applicant’s complaint; and (2) 6 June 2017 decision of
refusing to explain the 10 May 2017 decision.  46.  I find on the information and material submitted to me that the decision of 10 May 2017 followed the established procedures, and
that the decision of 6 June 2017 did not constitute a refusal to explain the decision of 10 May 2017, but rather that the details
of the legal advice not recommending a criminal investigation could not be disclosed, and an invitation had been extended to the
applicant in a letter dated 21 July 2017 to contact the relevant ICAC officer should he have any queries, which he did not do.  47.  In light of the foregoing, I am of the view that the grounds for judicial review are not reasonably arguable and leave is therefore

DCB v. AB [2018] HKCFI 717; HCMP 2173/2014 (9 April 2018),"37.  This Court directed on 12 March 2018 that the Father should provide evidence of having to leave Hong Kong on 27 March 2018.  There
was no response from the Father.  Thereafter, this Court further directed on 15 March 2018, amongst other things, that unless he
was to produce to the Court sufficient evidence on or before 26 March 2018 that he received notice to travel from his employer after
8 January 2018, the hearing on 28 March 2018 would stand.  There was again no response to this direction.  The Father simply did
not turn up at the hearing on 28 March 2018. 38.  The above in fact would have justified this Court in dismissing his summons outright at the hearing. Unless there is a reasonable
explanation from the Father, this Court will regard his attitude as one of disrespect to the Court. 39.  The Father is also reminded to seek legal advice as soon as possible on the consequences of failing to comply with this order, namely

CHINACULTURE.COM LTD v. LAM TING BALL AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 742; HCA 2902/2017 (11 April 2018),"9.  In my view, although this response to the complaint of an undervaluation is pleaded in general terms, it raises the matters which
the evidence I have referred to above addresses.  The amendments proposed to be made to [15] flesh out the averment in sub-para (3)
and describe the advice the Board received and, which it appears largely determined the offer price.  It is hardly a surprise that
the Board took advice from investment bankers on an appropriate offer price and that the Board was largely guided by what it was
told.  Excluding evidence about this would leave the court with an incomplete picture of what took place.  What seems to have happened
is that neither party has properly understood the other sides’s case and that the sooner it is clear from the pleadings what each
party contend and evidence is prepared to address the arguments and counter-arguments the better.  If, as may be the case, the real
issues are (a) whether the method of pricing the shares was wrong and resulted in an underpricing and (b) the Board was negligent
in not recognising this; the sooner this becomes clear and relevant evidence adduced the better. 10.  I will, therefore, allow the amendments and dismiss the summons to strike out the contentious evidence.  The costs of and occasioned
by the amendments be to the Plaintiff in any event.  So far as the costs of the two summonses are concerned I will make an order
nisi that the costs of both be in the cause with a certificate for two counsel.  I consider that this is an appropriate order given that
the applications have been contentious because in my view of a degree of confusion to which both parties have to some degree contributed. 11.  If further directions are required for the conduct of the Action or the current directions require amendment the parties should
approach my Clerk to fix an early case management conference.","CNT GROUP LIMITED

SHIN KIN MAN v. CONVOY CHINA FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD [2018] HKCFI 860; HCMP 42/2018 (13 April 2018),"2.  The application, I must say, is a little bizarre.  The Company has already been convicted by the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts of
breaches of the Ordinance for the years 2014 and 2015.  The time for prosecution has already expired for the earlier years and therefore
an extension of time is not necessary for those years in order to avoid the risk of prosecution.  The remaining year is 2016. 3.  However, it is quite clear from the evidence that has been filed by Mr Shin, who is a director of the Company, that he knew of the
requirements of the Ordinance and must have understood them by 15 February 2017 at the very latest.  By that date not only had the
Company received letters from the Companies Registry asking questions about the apparent non-compliance, but on that date Mr Shin
attended a meeting with the Companies Registry to discuss the matter.  It will be appreciated that the Company had until 30 September
2017 in order to prepare its financial statement for the calendar year 2016 and lay the financial statement before the Company in
general meeting.  There is no explanation in the evidence of why despite being aware of the requirements of the Ordinance by the
15 February 2017 at latest, the Company failed in the following seven and a half months to prepare financial statements and lay them
before the Company at an AGM.  4.  It seems to me clear in those circumstances that there is no basis for the court to exercise its discretion to extend time in respect
of the 2016 accounts and I therefore dismiss the originating summons.  No order as to costs was sought in the originating summons
and none is necessary.","CONVOY CHINA FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED

 Even if Mr. Chan found it difficult to locate the 3 co‑workers, as his main defence must be that he and the plaintiff were some

a business agreement. In any case, the prejudice against the plaintiff of not being able to claim against a potential employer far
outweighs any prejudice against Chan. 31.  Accordingly, I would grant order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 10 of the Summons. 32.  As for costs:",Date of Decision: 16 April 2018(Harold Leong),Master of the High Court,/2018/762.html,"

CHAN KON FUNG v. GALLOP PIONEER LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 766; HCA 1357/2011 (17 April 2018),"157.  Mr Li SC made a final complaint that the terms of the 19/12/17 Order looked quite different from the Proposed Directions. I note
PRC Yunnan Tin was the only party who proactively made proposals for disposal of the joinder applications, and it invited alternative
proposals by P and/or Ds (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). In my view, there was nothing in Mr Li SC’s contention. The 19/12/17
Order took into account the state of progress of and other outstanding matters in the present litigation, and weaved a case management
timetable to fit in those matters (including the Expert Summons). But this did not detract from the fact that PRC Yunnan Tin achieved
substantial success in respect of the PRCYT Summons. 158.  Having considered all the circumstances and for all the above reasons, I consider that costs should follow the event save that a
discount is made to reflect the matters in paragraphs 155-156 above. I therefore order that P shall pay PRC Yunnan Tin 80% of the
costs of and occasioned by the PRCYT Summons (including costs of the 3rd Hearing on 19 December 2017 and all costs reserved if any) to be taxed forthwith if not agreed with certificate for two counsel. 159.  Although Mr Li SC suggested it might not be appropriate to have certificate for two counsel, the complexity of the matter as explained
in this decision spoke to the propriety of having two counsel. I also note P also engaged two counsel to resist Ds’ and PRC Yunnan
Tin’s applications for costs.","(b)            
the PRCYT Summons overlapped with Ds’ Joinder and Amended Joinder Summonses which were disclosed to PRC Yunnan Tin on 7 March 2017
(see paragraph 13 above) well before PRC Yunnan Tin issued the PRCYT Summons on 10 April 2017, so PRC Yunnan Tin as “putative party”
could have simply filed evidence in support of Ds’ joinder application and asked to be heard at the 3rd Hearing without making any separate application.(Marlene Ng)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/766.html,"

It would in my view given the very unique circumstances of the facts of this case be unjust to the 2nd appellant if I were to shut my eyes to the “extra time” of 148 days in judicial detention.  This effective ‘loss’ of time
suffered by the appellant was because he was in judicial detention and then released without conviction.  The time spent in judicial
detention was not for a short period.  39.  That said I am not saying that those detained for long periods should be entitled to a more favourable consideration by the court

of my discretion to take that into account so as to reduce the sentence.   40.  In all the circumstances of this case, I consider justice demands that the appeal be allowed.  The sentence of 22 months and 2 weeks’

magistrate’s finding that the appellant was acquitted as she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s
judgment was not affected by her eye-diseases as exactly disclosed and supported by those three medical reports which were already
within the knowledge of the prosecution even before the trial.  During the trial, neither was the medical evidence of DW2 challenged
by the prosecution nor did the prosecution call upon their own expert to testify in reply.  Based on the reason of the acquittal,
despite the adverse findings against the appellant by the magistrate, the prosecution case was inherently weak and the prosecution
has not discharged the burden and failed to prove whether the appellant knew or believed she was making a false claim and thereby
misleading the police. Based on the reasons of the acquittal, it would also seem that the whole trial was unnecessary and the costs
occasioned by the defence could have be avoided if the prosecution took the same view of the magistrate on the medical reports submitted
and accepted the offer by the defence to dispose the matter without a trial. 24.  For the above reasons, I disagree with the respondent who submitted that there was clear evidence before the magistrate for her
to conclude that the appellant had in fact brought suspicion upon herself.   25.  Accordingly, I will allow this appeal to award costs of the trial to the appellant to be taxed, and I also award the appellant her

SZETO KWOK HUNG ROQUE v. SZETO KWOK KWONG BERNARD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1069; HCMP 2596/2017 (18 April 2018),"11.  I have considered the various affidavits filed by and on behalf of the parties.  I have also considered the submissions of Mr Remedios
and the plaintiff.  There are indeed factual matters which are in dispute, and potentially hotly.  They include whether the defendants
had caused Madam Tang to have been discharged from hospital prematurely, whether the plaintiff had made threats to Madam Tang and
the 1st defendant, whether the plaintiff had been denied access to Madam Tang whilst she was at her residence, whether the plaintiff had
been refused access to Madam Tang’s medical records, and whether the defendants had otherwise provided adequate care to Madam Tang.
 These are all issues which cannot be appropriately adjudicated upon summarily on affidavit evidence only.  I further note that in
his written submissions, the plaintiff was still trying to offer evidence which has not been covered by his previous affidavits.
 All these will have to be tidied up so as to make the action trial ready. 12.  I have considered the appropriate procedural options ahead.  One alternative to ordering that the action be proceeded with as if
commenced by writ is to order the attendance of witnesses for cross-examination.  The action will become ready for trial earlier.
 Time is important, given the age of Madam Tang.  On the other hand, given the imposition and continuation of the inter partes Injunction Order, and that the status quo appears to have been satisfactorily maintained, time pressure is slightly off.  Given the extent of the dispute on facts, and the
fact that the action was only commenced in late November last year, I am of the view on balance that I should accede to the defendants’
application and order that the action should be continued as if commenced by writ.  I also made the directions sought in the Directions

 More particularly, she seems to think that the Presiding Officer has decided against her on the Settlement Agreement or that she
could obtain a determination avoiding the Settlement Agreement by appealing against the Order.  I say so because: 12.  The Presiding Officer has not made any determination regarding the validity of the Settlement Agreement either way.  She has simply
decided, correctly, that the claimant has to go to another court for adjudication on the Settlement Agreement.  That other court
is not the CFI hearing an application for leave to appeal against the Order.  On an application for leave to appeal under s 32 of
the LTO, the CFI is confined to investigating if the award, order or determination under challenge is erroneous in point of law or
outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  It cannot do anything about the Settlement Agreement.  If the claimant wishes to pursue
the matter, she has to commence fresh proceedings. 13.  For these reasons, I dismiss the claimant’s application for leave to appeal against the Order.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision: 20 April 2018(Lisa Wong),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/852.html,"

be that there should be a variation of the Consent Order in this respect, to make it a more flexible arrangement.  Also, I think
the time has come to review the frequency of Monthly Reports, namely whether it can be reduced in frequency.  I hope the parties
can come to an agreement on these matters and submit a consent summons to reflect any necessary variation.  223.

The credibility of these witnesses would be an important issue in the trial.  If the court were to find that Mr Tung is not a credible

 The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant has committed acts of passing-off in that the Defendant’s use of the marks as specified
above, which are either identical or confusingly similar to the Plaintiff’s trade names and trade marks on goods which are identical
or similar to the Plaintiff’s products, willlikely mislead the public into believing that the goods sold by the Defendantwere goods

MA WAI WAH v. NEWAY KARAOKE BOX LTD [2018] HKCFI 842; HCA 669/2013 (25 April 2018),"125.  I have found that $50 million of the loan advanced to Ma were dividends declared and paid by the Company in August 2007, out of
which $4 million representing Ma’s share were handed over to Ma.  Suek might have dishonestly represented or treated the dividend
as his.  That does not change the nature of the payment.  The dividend had been duly paid to Ma.  I have accordingly reduced the
actual amount of loan.  The claim for dividend against the Company therefore fails. The overall result would not have been any different
had I ruled otherwise. The Company would be liable in paying the wrong person and had to pay the dividend to Ma again, but Ma’s
liability under Suek’s counterclaim would be increased by the same amount.  The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is dismissed. 126.  In view of the above conclusion, there is no need to consider the counterclaim by the defendant, which, as Mr Mak submits, would
only arise if I were to find in favour of the plaintiff in the claim. 127.  In conclusion, I make the following orders:",Date of Judgment: 25 April 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/842.html,"

RE RBC INVESTOR SERVICES TRUST HONG KONG LTD [2018] HKCFI 890; [2018] 5 HKC 80; HCMP 2740/2017 (27 April 2018),"36.  One of the reasons the applicant advanced for the application is that the existence of unclaimed assets in the applicant’s system
“represents an unnecessary expenditure of time and resources to continue to maintain records and to ring-fence the unclaimed assets”.
 Given the nature of the applicant’s business and the services it provides outlined, continuing costs to ring-fence such assets
would be part of its ordinary business costs and nothing out of the ordinary.  But funds and securities lodged in the High Court
are held subject to the Suitors’ Funds Rules (“the Suitors’ Funds Rules”) with the consequence that the cost of administering
such assets would be defrayed out of the general revenue of Hong Kong.  The order would effectively transfer the costs burden from
the applicant to the taxpayer and needs justification. 37.  In the present case, the fact that the bulk of unclaimed assets were in a sense ‘inherited’ by RBC in that those assets were
already unclaimed by the time RBC acquired a majority interest in the applicant in 2012 and, as such, was not of the applicant’s
own making.  While adequate due diligence in 2012 might have brought the current problems to light earlier, it is highly unlikely
that it would have made any difference to the state of affairs.  38.  Rule 23(1) of the Suitors’ Funds Rules provides that where a sum of money remains unclaimed in the court for a period of 5 years,
the Chief Justice may, on application by the Registrar, order such sum to be transferred to the general revenue of Hong Kong.  Were
this court to make an order under section 62, at the end of the five years, it would be open to the Registrar to apply for an order
that the unclaimed assets be dealt with pursuant to rule 23.  The amount likely to be added to general revenue in that event would
far exceed any administration costs. In any case little purpose would be served in continuing the status quo.","8.

HKSAR v. WALSH KENT ANDREW [2018] HKCFI 921; HCCC 368/2015 (27 April 2018),"6.  A similar decision was given in Secretary for Security v Sakthevel Prabakar [2003] HKCFA 37;  (2003) 6 HKCFAR 397.  The Appeal Committee of the Court of Final Appeal held that even in the field of public law, the fact that an appeal would be academic
as between the parties was a strong factor against granting leave to appeal, but it was not an absolute bar.  The Committee stated
that granting of appeal could be appropriate if there was a sufficiently great public interest to be served by having a question
of public law decided by the Court of Final Appeal.[3] 7.  The final case on which Mr McCoy relies is a decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in R v Gordon – Smith [2008] NZSC 56;  [2009] 1 NZLR 721, where it was held that mootness was not a matter that deprived accorded jurisdiction to hear an appeal, but like the other cases
to which I have referred, emphasising that there were important reasons for caution in exercising discretion to hear an appeal when
there were no live issues between the parties.  These included the importance of the adversary system, the need for economy and the
use of court resources and the proper role of the courts.[4]  The Court analysed these reasons, emphasising that a cautious approach should be taken to leave applications where there are no
live issues between the parties.[5]  It would seem to me that given the nature of the application and the issues that have to be considered, that this is an exercise
of discretion by the relevant appellate court.  8.  I therefore refused the application, although I note in passing that the applicant may proceed to apply for a certificate and leave
to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal pursuant to section 32(3) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance.",Date of Ruling: 27 April 2018(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/921.html,"

the Petitioner and Yuen, who were equal partners, seem to me to suggest that a winding-up petition in respect of Grandview was not
surprising and was perhaps foreseeable if not even inevitable.  Nor can I conclude that the change in circumstances was brought about
by some unreasonable conduct on the part of the Petitioner: see Brookes, supra, at §6(6).  In any event, Yuen did not insist that Grandview be wound up as a condition for withdrawing his strike-out summons against
the petition for winding up the Company. 13.  Furthermore, although the petition to wind up Grandview was issued on 27 January 2017, the summons to withdraw the strike-out summons
was not issued until 15 March 2017, a mere 6 days before the hearing. In fact, the Petitioner’s affirmation of 1 August 2016 already
stated that because of the deadlock, Grandview might go into default and he anticipated that an application to wind it up was imminent. 14.  In these circumstances I do not think the strike‑out summons was rendered academic by subsequent developments.  I was not impressed
by its merits to start with, and it seems to me it was simply withdrawn by Yuen for his own strategic or other reasons.  For these
reasons the costs must be paid by Yuen to the Petitioner, including the costs of the argument on costs.",IN THE MATTER of SMART LAND INVESTMENT LIMITED (Company No. 1003073)(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First Instance High Court,/2018/901.html,"

I should mention there was a question, which I confess was first raised by me, as to whether s 42 of the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4), which empowers the court to make orders for discovery by third parties, applies in relation to the removal application at
all because under the section the power is conferred on the court “[o]n the application … of a party to any proceedings in which
a claim is made”.  It was not clear to me what kind of “claim” was envisaged and whether the removal application qualifies
as proceedings “in which a claim is made”. 27.  Prior to the Civil Justice Reform in 2009, s 42 was confined to “proceedings in which a claim in respect of personal injuries to a person or in respect of a person’s death is made” (italics added).  As a result of the recommendation in the reform to make non‑party discovery applicable to “all types
of cases (and not merely to personal injury and death claims)”[7], the words italicised in the quotation above were removed.  The section was therefore not enacted with a view to distinguishing between
proceedings in which a claim is made and proceedings in which no claim is made.  Rather, it was amended with the object of extending
its scope from proceedings in which claims for damages for personal injury and death are made to all types of proceedings.  With
this object in mind I think there is no reason not to attach a wide meaning to the word “claim” which ought to encompass any
case in which relief is sought from the court. 28.  For these reasons both summonses for discovery are dismissed, with costs on a nisi basis.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/939.html,"

GENG HUA ZHONG AND ANOTHER v. LI SHU HON AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1041; HCCW 403/2017 (30 April 2018),"5.  Ms Law’s basis for suggesting that further financial information should be required demonstrating the current financial state
of the Company was that the onus was upon it to demonstrate its solvency and justify the application.  I accept that as a very general
statement, that would appear to be correct.  However, as I have sought to emphasise in Emagist [6]and on other occasions, applications for validation of expenses incurred in the normal course of business by a company, which the
petitioner itself says is solvent and acknowledges has an ongoing business, need to be considered in a practical manner.  If the
petitioner itself has in its petition acknowledged that a company is solvent and carrying on a business, one would not expect the
evidence that the company files to support a validation order to be particularly extensive as its financial state, or its general
financial state, should not be contentious.  It is only if the petitioner has particular concerns that it can substantiate about
the possible adverse impact on its economic interest in the company that the court should, in practice, be concerned to look in any
detail at its financial position.  The application is not an opportunity for the petitioner to obtain financial information not otherwise
available to it, or an opportunity to criticise or query the current management’s business decisions.  I would expect it only to
be in unusual cases for validation order applications arising from just and equitable winding‑up petitions issued by shareholders
to be contentious.  If both parties are being sensible, it should be possible for them to agree the terms of the validation order
which, it is now common practice, will contain a term requiring a schedule of payments to be provided on a monthly basis to the petitioner. 6.  I will make a validation order in the terms discussed with counsel which I will append to these reasons.  7.  I will make an order that the 1st respondent’s costs of the application are paid out of the assets of the Company.  Mr Maurellet SC sought no other costs order.
 Ms Law sought an order that the petitioners’ costs of the application be paid by the 1st respondent.  Although the application came on at short notice, it still seems to me that the petitioners should have been able to
have agreed an order with the 1st respondent as it is the petitioners’ principal position that no order should be made today.  I will, therefore, deal with costs
as Mr Maurellet SC proposes and make no costs order as between the 1st respondent and the petitioners.",Date of Decision: 30 April 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1041.html,"

RE THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHINA POINT STOCK BROKERS LTD [2018] HKCFI 1106; HCMP 297/2018 (3 May 2018),"3.  In these circumstances, it is necessary for the liquidators to be empowered to deal with the assets in such a way as to allow them
to bring the liquidation to an end.  That requires them to have the ability where possible to sell the securities and then to pay
the proceeds of the sale along with the cash that they also hold into court.  In the event that the liquidators are unable to sell
the securities, they will lodge the relevant share certificates with the Registrar of the High Court.  The mechanisms for achieving
these results are contained in sections 56 and 62 of the Trustee Ordinance, Cap 29.  4.  The approach of the court in these circumstances is broadly as I have just described and the principles are explained a little more

HEITKAMP &AMP; THUMANN KG v. LIVING PROFIT TRADING DEVELOP LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1006; HCA 151/2017 (8 May 2018),"104.  In the circumstances, D2’s 1st and 3rd Summonses are dismissed. I grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P costs of and occasioned by such summonses, including all costs reserved if any, to be taxed forthwith if not
agreed. 105.  As regards the D2 2nd Summons, once HSBC disclosed the bank statements of the D2 Account pursuant to the HSBC Disclosure Order in February 2017, P should
have realised the available balance in D2 Account exceeded US$500,000 (or even US$520,000), so there was no point in pursuing the
Disclosure Order in aid of the Injunction Order. Steps could have been taken then (or at least when D2 served the D2 1st Summons) to abandon or withdraw the Disclosure Order. The fact P did not do so until just before or at the Hearing meant P should
pay D2’s costs of the D2 2nd Summons. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that P shall pay D2’s costs of and occasioned by such summons, including all costs reserved if any, to be taxed forthwith if not
agreed. 106.  As for the P Summons, the relief sought in paragraph 28(a) above asked for continuation of Injunction Order, which was unnecessary
given the Inter Partes Order. The relief sought in paragraph 28(d) above asking for dismissal of the D 1st and 2nd Summonses was unnecessary since the determination of such summonses would have resolved the matter. As for the abandoned reliefs
in paragraph 28(b)-(c) above and the consequential relief in paragraph 28(e) above, on 28 July 2017 D2’s solicitors proposed payment
of US$520,000 into court.[79] When P’s solicitors wrote to D2’s solicitors on 7 November 2017 to confirm P’s agreement to such proposal with slight variation
that HSBC shall be directed to pay US$500,000 (or HK$ equivalent) (instead of US$520,000) out of the D2 Account into court as security
for P’s claim with costs reserved to enable the Injunction Order to be discontinued and the Hearing to be vacated, D2’s solicitors
replied on 13 November 2017 to say such belated response did not reflect any sincerity on P’s part, and in any event the offer
was “water under the bridge”. By then D2 was not willing to make payment into court as she believed the Injunction Order would
not have survived the Hearing, and she asked P to consent to immediate discharge of the Injunction Order with costs to her. As the
outcome of the D 1st and 3rd Summonses demonstrated, D2’s stance was inappropriate. But then the P Summons was also unnecessary. Since payment into court was
no better or different for P than the Injunction Order (with the amount to be frozen reduced to US$500,000), and as D2 unwilling
to make payment into court, there was no sensible reason for P to complicate matters by the proposal in the P Summons, especially
when instead of asking HSBC to pay US$500,000 out of the D2 Account into court P proposed an even more convoluted route by having
D2 utilise the funds in the D2 Account to buy a cashier order to give to P’s solicitors for payment into court. In my view, the
proper order (which I now make) is no order on the P Summons with costs order nisi that there be no order as to costs of such summons.","(b)            
The focus for P’s claim in knowing receipt and money had and received was on D2’s enrichment (US$500,000). Since D2’s liability
is restitutionary, it is fixed at the value of the property when she first received it.[77] 

     As for P’s proprietary claim, it was not necessarily inconsistent with the personal claim and recoveries from Haiyun and Welly
Smart. P had cumulative remedies and could go after the trustee or recipient, so the default judgment and recoveries against Haiyun
and Welly Smart would not necessarily debar P from suing D2. As explained in Serious Fraud Office v Lexi Holdings Plc,[78]
 “39. As made clear by Lord Millett in Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29;  [2001] 1 AC 102, an in personam claim against a defaulting trustee may be supplemented in addition by a claim to enforce an equitable charge or lien over the proceeds
in which the misappropriated assets have been mixed. That is an available remedy to secure compliance by the trustee with his personal
obligation to account. In this context Mr Marshall appositely cited the decision of the Privy Council in Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd [1996] 1 AC 514, 521 where Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said:


‘Faced with alternative and inconsistent remedies a plaintiff must choose between them. Faced with cumulative remedies a plaintiff
is not required to choose. He may have both remedies. He may pursue one remedy or the other remedy or both remedies, just as he wishes.
It is a matter for him. He may obtain judgment for both remedies and enforce both judgments. When the remedies are against two different
people, he may sue both persons. He may do so concurrently, and obtain judgment against both. Damages to the full value of goods
which have been converted may be awarded against two persons for successive conversions of the same goods. Or the plaintiff may sue
the two persons successively. He may obtain judgment against one, and take steps to enforce the judgment. This does not preclude
him from then suing the other.’            

      40. In the present case, Lexi by the form of the judgment it obtained on 19 March 2007 had elected to pursue its equitable
claim against M in personam. But that is not of itself inconsistent with a claim to an equitable charge, as Foskett v McKeown makes clear: it is a cumulative remedy in aid of an equitable in personam claim, not an alternative remedy. On the whole we do not think that, by electing to enter judgment in the form that it did, Lexi
is to be taken as having conclusively and for all purposes abandoned any further claim it might have for an equitable charge, sought
by way of further legal proceedings or steps. ……” 
But this is subject to prevention of double recovery, so it was necessary to turn to the amounts received by Haiyun and Welly Smart
from Pengshunyi.      

        Haiyun received US$790,000 from Pengshunyi, and P recovered HK$1,604,036.46 (ie about US$205,645.70 at the exchange rate
of HK$7.8 : US$1) from Haiyun. So P was entitled to sue D2 for the whole Haiyun Sum after giving credit.

Welly Smart received US$250,000 from Pengshunyi, and P recovered HK$1,455,887 (ie about US$186,652.18) from Welly Smart, so full
recovery of US$230,000 from D2 on its face may give rise to double recovery. Mr Ng suggested it was unclear whether the other sums
received by Welly Smart on 13-14 July 2016 were also traceable to P, but he conceded at the Hearing that at this stage there was
no evidence to support his contentions. But this was neither here nor there in light of (a) above.(Marlene Ng)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1006.html,"

been paid.  The circumstances warrant such a view of the facts.  At the hearing before me, the Appellant’s rerepresentative, Mr
Massink, told me that it is possible that the fixed penalty ticket had not been paid because he had many other tickets; and in fact,
he more or less accepted that that fixed penalty ticket had not been paid.  4.  In all the circumstances, there is no proper basis for reversing the Special Magistrate’s dismissal of the application for a review. 5.

HKSAR v. BUTT MUHAMMAD ATEEQ [2018] HKCFI 1258; HCMA 13/2018 (14 May 2018),"6.  The final paragraph of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings consists of a single sentence which reads “Court finds the prosecution
has proved their case beyond all reasonable doubts and the defendant is convicted.”  Why the Magistrate so found appears in the
last two sentences of the penultimate paragraph of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings.  Those two sentences read: “Although
I have doubt regarding the missing tools and have excluded the verbal admission, I accept [PC 5018’s] evidence that he actually
found P1 in a wallet (P4) defendant was carrying.  I find the defendant has no lawful authority or reasonable excuse to have P1 in
his possession.” 7.  Albeit on the papers, appeals of this kind from the Magistrates’Court to the High Court are by way of rehearing.  While due weight
is to be attached to a magistrate’s advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses,the appellate judge will not affirm a conviction
if not satisfied that it is safe.  The Magistrate tried the case conscientiously of course, but has offered noexplanation why PC
5018’s evidence that he found P1 on the Appellant can be safely relied upon even though his evidence that the Appellant made a
verbal admission to him cannot be safely relied upon.  Neither of those twopieces of evidence is materially more susceptible to honest
mistake than the other.  In fairness to PC 5018, it should be stressed that neither anything said by the Magistrate nor anything
said by me involves finding that he had not been honest.  But the Magistrate not having felt it safe to rely upon PC 5018’s evidence
that the Appellant had made an oral admission to him, I am not satisfied that the reliance which the Magistrate placed on PC 5018’sevidence
of finding P1 on the Appellant is safe.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the conviction is safe. 8.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed.",Date of Judgment: 14 May 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1258.html,"

HKSAR v. APARECIDA RODRIGUES GRAZZIELE [2018] HKCFI 571; HCCC 55/2016 (15 May 2018),"35.  As I have indicated, the sentencing of the defendant has been adjourned on a number of occasions to allow the authorities to make
certain overseas inquiries as a result of assistance provided by her.  As a result of dealing with authorities abroad and through
official channels, the inquiries have been delayed or without response.  36.  I have had submitted to me a detailed account of the assistance that the defendant has provided to the relevant authorities thus
far, which appears to be an earnest effort on her part to assist the authorities.  A chronology has been prepared by the prosecution
which was submitted on 11 May 2018 which details the inquiries and the results in relation to the defendant’s assistance to the
authorities.  However, I am informed that at this stage, the assistance provided by the defendant has not been appropriately confirmed
and evaluated and therefore cannot be taken into account in the sentence to be passed on the defendant.  If anything is to arise
in the future, there is the procedure of making an application to the executive for any valuable assistance provided to the authorities
that could properly be taken into account in adjusting a sentence that has already been imposed. 37.  According to the tariff guidelines, a starting point of 23 years and 9 months’ imprisonment is suggested by way of arithmetical
calculation which I will adopt.  I will enhance the starting point for the international element by 2 years.  Accordingly, the enhanced
starting point for sentence is 25 years and 9 months’ imprisonment, which I will reduce by one year for the genuine and positive
participation by the defendant in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign to 24 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.  This term will be reduced
by one-third for the defendant’s guilty plea, thus resulting in a sentence of 16 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/571.html,"

or inconsistencies even at the substantive hearing, there was no finding that this case was brought by Ps with an ulterior motive
or for an improper purpose or that there had been some deception or underhand conduct on the part of Ps.  There were only unexplained
inconsistencies and this was the main basis why this Court was of the view that the central part of P’s pleadings were so defective
that it was not a matter of simple amendment but of reconstituting the claim.  On such basis, the SOC and the action were struck
out as an abuse of process. 27.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case including time was spent by P on an unnecessary issue, even though there were
unexplained inconsistencies, I have come to the view that there were no special or unusual features in this matter to justify an
order of costs on indemnity basis.  I therefore dismiss Ds’ application for variation of the Order Nisi. 28.  Costs of the application should follow the event and be paid by Ds.  However, I am of the view that this matter can be dealt with

WADDINGTON LTD v. CHAN CHUN HOO THOMAS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1113; HCA 3291/2003 (17 May 2018),"22.  On behalf of the Plaintiff, Mr Lam applied, belatedly at the hearing on 14 May 2018, for relief from sanction under Order 2, rule
5.  That rule provides as follows:- 23.  No prior notice of intention to apply for relief from sanction was given by Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that it was plainly
aware, from Mr Law’s Skeleton Argument dated 10 May 2018, that the 5th Defendant would rely on Order 2, rule 4 to resist the Summons.  Further, it is clear from Order 2, rule 5 that a range of matters
mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) thereof have to be considered before the court may grant relief from sanction under that rule.
 Quite apart from the requirement in rule 5(2) that the application must be supported by evidence, it seems to me to be clear, as
a matter of procedural fairness, that a party intending to apply for relief from sanction must give proper notice of the application
to the other side so that it will have an opportunity, if so advised, to file evidence which may be relevant to the matters mentioned
in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) to resist the application.  This was not done.  I am therefore not prepared to entertain the Plaintiff’s
oral application made at the hearing for relief from sanction under Order 2, rule 5. 24.  There is, I consider, no answer to Mr Law’s submission that the Plaintiff’s application for an extension of time to comply with
paragraph 2 of the March 2018 Order is misconceived.  Accordingly, the Summons is dismissed with costs to the 5th Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.","PROFIT POINT LIMITED

I wish to make an observation on the procedure for leave application in a matter of the present type. 84.  There was in this case an inter parte leave application which was heard in January 2017.  Following the judgment where DHCJ Lee
gave leave to appeal, there was an application by Bauer for leave to appeal against that judgment.  That resulted in another hearing
on 16 May 2017 and a Ruling by the learned Deputy Judge dated 26 May 2017.  Dissatisfied with the Ruling, Bauer then sought leave
from the Court of Appeal.  That application was heard and dismissed on 24 August 2017 with Reasons for Judgment and Decision on Costs
given on 4 September 2017.  85.  Speaking for myself, I would have found it quite difficult to determine the application for leave to appeal against Award (1) without
getting into much details and a great deal of assistance by counsel on both sides.  I believe that there is scope for a roll-up hearing
for the leave application, which is sometimes adopted in judicial review proceedings, in an usually difficult case.  The decision
whether to adopt such a procedure is of course that of the judge seized of the matter.  This procedure has the attractions of speed
and saving of costs.  It will be in line with the underlying objectives embodied in O1A, r 1.",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1057.html,"

CITIBANK N.A. v. THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1102; HCMP 624/2018 (18 May 2018),"13.  Further, it should have been apparent to the defendant banks that the scope of discovery sought by Citibank is far too wide and
unnecessary for the stated purpose of the application.  Yet, neither of them appeared at the hearing on 17 May 2018 or otherwise
rendered assistance to the court.  According to Citibank’s solicitors, HSBC has not responded at all since being served with the
originating summons and the evidence in support of the same while HSB has by a letter dated 7 May 2018 to Citibank’s solicitors
indicated neutrality towards the present application and merely asked for more time to comply with the order. 14.  The individuals and companies whose documents and information are sought by Citibank are not before the court (or even given notice)
to speak for themselves or protect their own interests.  They are however customers of HSBC and HSB.  The banks owe each such customer
a duty of confidentiality in respect of the documents and information applied for.  Any order for disclosure, whether wide or narrow,
would involve a breach of confidentiality by the banks (though condoned by the court order).   15.  That being the case, a respondent to a Norwich Pharmacal application in the position of the defendant banks here should not just sit back and wait and see how the court would dispose of
the application.  Rather, I would expect it to fulfil its duty to the customer affected by scrutinising the application with care
and, where there is a reasonable/proper ground of objection, to protect its customer’s interest and to render assistance to the court by raising and arguing such objection.
 Needless to say, any costs reasonably incurred for such purposes would be recoverable from the applicant.",Date of Handing Down of Reasons for Decision: 18 May 2018(Lisa Wong),Judge of the Court of First Instance,/2018/1102.html,"

CHOW STEEL INDUSTRIES PUBLIC CO LTD AND OTHERS v. KO SUNG AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1622; HCMP 2711/2017 (18 May 2018),"24.  The only other issue which arose as a result of this adjournment is whether the current position in terms of security for costs
and fortification is appropriate.  I note what was stated at the hearing before Madam Justice Lisa Wong where this was first considered.
 It seems to me that this is a matter which the Court can always revisit.  I do not consider that the only reason why fortification
should now be considered is because of a delay as a result of filing of late evidence.  At the end of the day even if the Court had
proceeded to hear the argument, unless judgment was to be delivered immediately there would be a time gap between the hearing and
delivery of the judgment.  And during that period a loss could conceivably arise by reason of the defendants having suffered by reason
of the injunction, which later transpired should not have been granted. 25.  I have regard to the financial statements which were in the evidence produced by the 1st plaintiff and some of the criticisms which were made by the defendants as regards the financial situation of the plaintiffs and their
debt position.  I do not intend to conduct a scientific exercise.  Suffice to say that the 1st plaintiff is out of the jurisdiction and there is no suggestion that it has assets, whether of a fixed or liquid nature, within the
jurisdiction. 26.  Having considered that there might be an adjournment of a matter of weeks or perhaps a couple of months, it seems to me that having
regard to the amounts which have been disclosed by the defendants currently subject to a Mareva injunction, that the amount of HK$1 million being interim fortification would be appropriate.","PREMIER SOLUTIONS CONSULTANCY LIMITED

with and/or risk of harm arising from the perpetrators of harm (Geoff and George and their associates) in this case.”  This evidence
would not have taken ground 1 any further.  Also, the adjudicator essentially accepted what had happened to the applicant when he
was young until he was about 16 living with Geoff and accepted how he came to be employed by George and how that employment came
to an end. 71.  After a careful examination of the grounds and submissions, I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the
adjudicator.  I see no evidence of procedural unfairness nor a failure to adhere to the high standard of fairness required.  The
substantive decision did satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was not Wednesbury unreasonable. 72.

The purpose of the adjournment, as I understand it, is that Romail will not have to return to Pakistan pending considering of the
DV Application.  However, his physical presence in Hong Kong is not required for the Director’s consideration of the DV Application.
 There is, I consider, no proper legal grounds to justify adjourning the present applications.  As to whether Romail should be required
to leave Hong Kong in the meantime, that is a matter for the Director and not for the court to decide. 29.  For the foregoing reasons, the two applications are not reasonably arguable and are dismissed.

廣東省廣業環保產業集團有限公司 (FORMALLY KNOWN AS 廣東省廣業工業建設集團有限公司) v. PO ON CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LTD [2018] HKCFI 1380; HCA 362/2015 (24 May 2018),"12.  There is no evidence in support of the defendant’s counterclaim.  It has been provisionally struck out.  The three-month period
for the defendant to make application for restoration of the same has not expired (which will soon do on 28 May 2018).  The trial
has however taken place.  Rather than to wait for the expiry of the three-month period, I now formally dismiss the counterclaim. 13.  In the circumstances, and having heard the evidence, I allow the plaintiff’s claim and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim.
 I give judgment to the plaintiff in the said sum of HK$5,322,020.  I further order that costs of both the claim and counterclaim
be to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed. 14.  As to interest, I note that there was a substantial time gap between the accrual of the cause of action and the commencement of
the present action.  I do not deem it fair to order pre-judgment interest for the entire period.  I note that on 19 August 2013,
the plaintiff through a firm of lawyers in the Mainland formally issued a letter of demand to the defendant for payment of the outstanding
sums.  That date appears to me to be a fair starting point for pre-judgment interest to run.  Having heard Mr Chow, I award pre-judgment
interest on that sum of HK$5,322,020 at the rate of prime plus 1% from 19 August 2013 to the date of this judgment, and thereafter
until payment at the judgment rate.","PO ON CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING LIMITED

TOP CATERING DEVELOPMENT LTD v. CHAN SZE NGA FIONA T/A TASTY [2018] HKCFI 979; HCA 1817/2015 (30 May 2018),"60.  It follows that Tasty is liable to pay to Top Catering a net sum of: 61.  I therefore order that Tasty shall pay the sum of $480,862.20 to Top Catering with interest at 1% over the prevailing prime lending
rate of HSBC from the date of writ until the date of this judgment, and therefore at the judgment rate until payment. 62.  As to costs, Top Catering is, overall speaking, the successful party because Tasty is liable to pay a net sum to it.  Top Catering
succeeds on most of its claims whereas Tasty fails on most of its counterclaims (save those which Top Catering has already admitted).
 In the circumstances, Tasty should pay the costs of this action (including both Top Catering’s claims and Tasty’s counterclaims)
to Top Catering.  However, the amount that Top Catering can recover from Tasty is substantially less than the amount of its primary
claim; and it has failed on some items.  Adopting a broad-brush approach, I shall only allow Top Catering to recover 90% of the costs
that it has incurred in this action.  I shall make a costs order nisi that Tasty shall pay 90% of Top Catering’s costs in this action to be taxed if not agreed. If any party intends to apply to vary

LI MING AND OTHERS v. ZHANG CAIKUI AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1184; HCA 1282/2017 (30 May 2018),"23.  In Chong’s affirmation much was said about the damage that would be caused if Zhang Snr and the so‑called “Mi camp” were
permitted to gain control of the board of CSI.  Mr Westbrook submitted that it would be unreal to suggest CSCG could simply “scupper”
extant proceedings brought in its name without Tianrui complaining, and that the board proposed for the EGM of CSCG on 23 May included
representatives from all major shareholders including Tianrui.  In any event the short answer is that the point had already been
considered by DHCJ Keith Yeung SC: see his decision of 3 May 2018 at §§58‑66.  The learned Deputy Judge rejected the contention
that there would be irreparable damage if the CSI EGM was to be permitted to proceed, saying (at §64): 24.  As to the injunction sought by Dong and Wang, if the proxies were not rejected by Chong acting in the way he did, on the evidence
the resolutions proposed would clearly have been passed at the 8 May EGM with the result that the then directors of CSI would no
longer have been directors.  In these circumstances there was clearly available power by the grant of an interlocutory injunction
in Dong’s and Wang’s petition to prevent the board of directors (consisting of only two remaining directors at the time of hearing,
namely, Chong and Zhao YK) from continuing to act as such pending the meeting ordered: King Pacific International Holdings Ltd v Chun Kam Chiu & Others [2002] HKCFI 1101; [2002] 3 HKLRD 49.  Considering the strength of the case against them and the balance of convenience, I so ordered accordingly. 25.  For these reasons I granted an order under s 570 for an EGM of CSI to be held on 20 May 2018 and gave ancillary directions, and an injunction to prevent Chong and Zhao YK from acting

urgency for the receivership to be discharged pending the publication of the award and no prejudice for the BDO Receivers to remain
in place.  I was not persuaded by this argument.  First, the date of publication of the award had been extended before, and one did
not know that it would not be extended again.  Secondly, as Mr Chan SC submitted for ACC, the true question is whether there was
any further present need for the receivership to continue.  If not, the fact that it would in any event come to an end in due course
was not a reason against immediate discharge.  To say that there would be no harm for the BDO Receivers to continue was to put the
cart before the horse.  Thirdly, the arbitration was not for enforcement of the security such as the sale of pledged shares and the
application of the proceeds for repayment of the loans.  In the arbitration request as finally varied on 21 September 2017, Chen
HQ asked the arbitral tribunal: 31.  Mr Mok also submitted there had been delay on the part of the defendants in taking out the present application.  While it is true
that some of the developments relied upon had emerged some time ago, judgment in the Trust Actions was only given on 31 January 2018,
as a result of which the purchase of shares by Chen HQ could no longer be said to be “conditional” even on his original case.
 Further, Chen HQ’s case that he had irrevocably purchased the employee-plaintiffs’ interests in CSI did not emerge publicly
until the joinder application in the Trust Actions which was heard only on 10 November 2017.  Even if there was delay, there was
no suggestion of any prejudice caused to Chen HQ and I do not consider it should be a bar to relief. 32.

CHAN LUEN YAN AND OTHERS v. GOLDSFINE DEVELOPMENT LTD [2018] HKCFI 1212; HCA 3021/2016 (31 May 2018),"27.  I disagree with Mr Leung’s interpretation of the provision in the shareholder’s agreement.  I cannot see how the reasonableness
or otherwise of a demand for repayment can be determined by the defendant’s board.  It is something to be decided objectively.
 I agreement with Mr Lam.  Therefore, I would give summary judgment to the plaintiffs on this further ground that the demands are
reasonable and not arbitrary and the approval from the defendant’s board is not required. 28.  Though the unjust enrichment claim is defective, it could have been made good by a simple amendment to the effect that it was unjust
for the defendant to hold on to the loans which are interest free and without fixed term of repayment as the plaintiffs are no longer
shareholders of the defendant and have no interest in it.  To allow the defendant to keep the loans at the plaintiffs’ expense
is unjust to the plaintiffs and to enrich the defendant unjustly.  But even if the unjust enrichment claim is defective, it was not
necessary to have it struck out as summary judgment should have been given under the claim for repayment.  29.  In the premises, I allow the appeal and give summary judgment to the plaintiffs for the sums of HKD862,848.72, HKD647,136.55 and

that was required for dealing with costs of the 3 summonses before me, and the different basis for taxation for the Hau 2nd Wasted Costs Summons, I consider it more appropriate for costs in favour of the plaintiff under the above nisi orders to be taxed if not agreed. 139.

SURE WIN INC. LTD v. GP MOTORS LTD [2018] HKCFI 1211; HCA 861/2016 (1 June 2018),"10.  In the present case, I accept the Loss Adjustor’s evidence that the market value of the Vehicle was between $1.1 million to $1.2
million as at November 2014 and that the Vehicle had become a complete a write-off rendering its reinstatement wholly uneconomic.
 I am also satisfied the sum of $900 claimed for engaging the Loss Adjustor has been reasonably incurred. 11.  Proceeding on the basis that the market value of the Vehicle was $1.15 million (being the average of the range provided by the Loss
Adjustor), I award damages in the total sum of $1,125,900, with interest thereon at the rate of 8% from the date of the Writ to the
date of judgment, and thereafter at judgment rate until payment. This is calculated as follows: 12.  I make an order that the defendant do pay the costs of this assessment to the plaintiff, summarily assessed at $145,500.","Net Award:

factual averments have been added.  I agree that the adding of a legal conclusion when the plaintiff has already alleged wilful neglect
and wilful default cannot give rise to any prejudice.  14.  Further, the plaintiff is only relying on the existing pleaded particulars in support of their case on gross negligence. 15.  I disagree with the defendant that the pleading of gross negligence should not be allowed because it is demurrable.  In my view,
it is arguable, as indeed it is argued by the plaintiff, that the difference between negligence and gross negligence is one of degree
and not kind.","HSBC INTERNATIONAL TRUSTEE	LIMITED

INVEST GAIN LTD v. NOVEL GOOD LTD [2018] HKCFI 1226; HCA 939/2013 (4 June 2018),"34.  I accept what was submitted by Mr Wong. 35.  As set out by DHCJ Yee in Toyota Tsucho(HK) Corporation Limited and Chimei Innolus Corporation and anor HCA 1173/2011, (unreported) 25.02.15 Decision, the court has to embark on a balancing exercise having particular regard to the reason
for lateness (if any), the relevance and necessity of the new evidence to be adduced and any prejudice that the other side would
suffer if such new evidence is to be allowed to be included, and all the matters have to be considered in light of the specific circumstances
of the case. 36.  In my view, as the trial was set down for 10 days, there should be sufficient time for D to take instructions on the emails. I accept
that there would be prejudice to D due to the lateness but there was no sufficient evidence that there needed to be an adjournment
of the trial or there would be any serious disruption to the trial.  As I have said, the emails were contemporaneous documents and
on the face of it, they would be relevant and necessary in relation to 3 of the disputed issues in the Scott Schedule. Having weighed

been filed on behalf of the Company by Mr Zhang Lei, in my view, clearly does not explain why at least a sum of US$12,905,000 is
not payable.  It does not seem to me that the payment of at least that sum is an issue in dispute in the arbitration.  5.  That being the case, there is no evidence before the court which demonstrate a bona fide defence on substantial grounds to the claim for that sum and I can see no justification for requiring the arbitration to be completed
before allowing the petitioners to petition to wind up the Company for the significant debt which, on the basis of the evidence before

 Mr Ho argued that the interest entitlement should be reduced by reason of the delay in launching this action.  On balance, I am

 Maintenance of his father ought to be a shared burden amongst himself and his two sisters.  This is not unreasonable, quite irrespective
of whether any inference may be drawn from the trustees’ suggestion that the sisters have claimed parents’ dependency allowance
for taxation purpose (which the bankrupt indeed disputed).  The trustees mentioned the possibility of application for old age living
allowance, but that would really be subject to test of eligibility.  So I would say no more about its possible relevance in the balancing
exercise. 8.  The bankrupt has failed to show, either by evidence or his representation to the court, that the trustees have erred or failed to

on 6 June 2018, to be taxed if not agreed. 35.  In so far as the Petitioner’s own costs are concerned, I am not minded to allow legal aid taxation, because those costs have been
incurred as a result of what I regard to be elementary mistakes on the part of the Petitioner’s legal adviser(s) who have acted
well below the standard that could reasonably be expected of reasonably competent lawyers.  In this regard, in addition to the mistake
in using the incorrect form of application originally, there was a failure to apply for directions promptly on 17 May 2018 even though
they had been alerted by the court of the mistake, and also a failure to apply for an extension of time to issue the Inter Partes
Directions Summons until the hearing on 6 June 2018 notwithstanding the Department of Justice’s letters dated 24 and 29 May 2018
respectively.  In my view, the mistakes and shortcomings are quite inexcusable, and costs have been unnecessarily incurred and wasted.
 However, in case there should be some other relevant matters which I am not aware of or which I ought to have taken into account

HKSAR v. LEUNG TIN KEI AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1329; HCCC 408/2016 (11 June 2018),"70.  For the offence of assaulting a police officer which D1 admitted, the principles laid down in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] HKCA 397; [2016] 5 HKLRD 1 concerning the discount given on a guilty plea are applicable.  As the prosecution only added this charge after the committal proceedings
and after the listing of this case, D1 did not have the chance to plead guilty at any earlier stage.  As such, I would regard D1
as having pleaded guilty to this charge at the earliest opportunity and I am going to give him the full one-third discount.  18 months
being the starting point, the sentence is 12 months’ imprisonment after a one-third reduction. 71.  Since the offence of riot and the offence of assaulting a police officer arose from the same set of facts, and having considered
the totality principle, I order the sentences of these two offences to run concurrently.  D1 is therefore sentenced to imprisonment
for 6 years in total for these two offences. 72.  As for the offence of riot admitted by D5, Ngo Van Nam is also applicable.  Since D5 only pleaded guilty after the listing of the case, he is not entitled to the full one-third discount.
 However, I would give him a discount of about 23%.  Apart from this, his personal background does not constitute a mitigating factor
in offences as serious as this.  Therefore, I order that D5 be sentenced to imprisonment for 3½ years for the offence of riot at
Argyle Street, which he admitted.",(Anthea Pang)Judge of the Court of First Instance of,the High Court,/2018/1329.html,"

LAW PO LIN v. HAU KWAI FAT AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1345; HCA 1443/2014 (14 June 2018),"46.  Enclosing land is strong evidence of manifestation of possession.  Mr Sherry argues that there is no evidence who erected the fence
enclosing the relevant part of the Land and there is a possibility that it was erected by the previous owners.  It is not the defendants’
evidence that the fence was erected by them or the Tong or their predecessor in title. It does not matter who erected the fence.
 What matters is who put the lock on the gate.  The undisputed evidence is that the lock was installed by the Father in his lifetime
and then the Mother.  That is strong evidence of manifestation of possession to the exclusion of the whole world including the defendants. 47.  There are other trivial arguments raised by Mr Sherry. I do not find it necessary to deal with them other than to say that I do
not agreewith those arguments.  Accordingly, I find that with effect from the date of LK&Co’s letter of 19 April 1995, the
Mother started to be in joint adverse possession of the Land with the Father.  Upon the Father’s death on 19 December 2005, the
Mother assumed sole adverse possession of the Land against the defendants.  The defendants and their predecessor in title had been
dispossessed of the Land for 57 years.  The Mother started joint adverse possession of the Land with the Father since 1995 and was
in such possession until her death on 15 May 2015.  The defendants’ right to recover the Land has long been lost and their title
extinguished by virtue of sections 7 and 17 of the Limitation Ordinance.  The defendants are absentee landlords.  They only have themselves to blame for not following through with their actions in 1995.
 48.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a case of adverse possession over the relevant part of the Land against the defendants.
 Accordingly, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants and grant her the order sought subject to the minor
amendments to be made to Annexure I of the Statement of Claim as to the precise boundary of the relevant part.  The defendants’
counterclaim is dismissed.  I also make a costs order that the plaintiff shall have costs of the action against the defendants.","(By Original Writ and by Order of Master R. Yu of the High Court to carry on proceedings dated the 1 September

the HP Agreement.  It apparently carries no other business.  It has been involvedon multiple occasions in the use of the underground
foreign exchange system to transfer funds.  He submitted, and I agree, that the evidence supports a real risk of dissipation. 64.  For the reasons set out above, I allow the plaintiff’s application for the continuation of the Injunction Order.  I dismiss its
application for variation of the same.  I also dismiss the defendant’s summons for the discharge of the Injunction Order. 65.  The plaintiff has not pursued its application for variation, which I have dismissed.  Despite its pleaded case, it for the purposes
of this application focused only upon the cause of action of restitution, which stance Mr Pao only made clear in his written submissions.

THE LIQUIDATOR OF WING FAI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. YIP KWONG ROBERT AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1369; HCCW 735/2002 (15 June 2018),"24.  The parties have in addition drawn attention to certain separate matters but I think they are not sufficiently relevant to affect
the outcome on costs.  For example, Ms Chow submitted that the 2nd Respondent brought contempt proceedings against Mr Kennedy for disclosing the transcripts of her private examination without leave
of the court.  These are separate proceedings the costs of which have been separately dealt with.  They were simply part of the highly
acrimonious battles between the parties. I do not see that the 2nd Respondent’s ultimate failure (having won in the Court of Appeal) in the contempt proceedings should affect the costs position in
the present proceedings. 25.  For the 2nd Respondent’s part, Mr Barlow referred to certain evidence and alleged that the Applicant had tried to use the criminal proceedings
against the 2nd Respondent to force or induce her to settle the misfeasance claim.  As I stated in my reasons for ruling handed down on 27 October
2016, the Applicant had not had an opportunity of responding to or refuting this allegation.  No finding has been made against him
in this respect.  It would not be right for present purposes to proceed on the basis that there was such wrongdoing on his part. 26.  It is not easy to put the above considerations individually into numerical terms and I do not think it is necessary to put a “value”
on each factor.  In exercising its discretion the court has to take a broad brush rather than an accountant’s pen.  Having regard
to all the circumstances, the order of costs I make is as follows:","KAM SHING

HKSAR v. LAM KIN [2018] HKCFI 1389; HCMA 438/2017 (15 June 2018),"8.  In so finding, the Magistrate accepted Alice’s description of the contact between the Appellant and her.  The correct approach
would then have been an objective consideration of whether the only reasonable inference to draw from that description was that all
the elements of indecent assault were duly proved.  But the Magistrate did not confine himself to such an approach.  Complaint is
made on the Appellant’s behalf against the passage in the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings in which he said as follows: 9.  Even an able and experienced Magistrate might occasionally fall into error.  It is submitted on the Appellant’s behalf that the
Magistrate had relied on, and had erred in law in relying on, Alice’s subjective belief that the contact between the Appellant
and her was intentional rather than accidental and was indecent rather than harmless.  From what the Magistrate said, the inescapable
conclusion is that he did indeed, to at least a material extent even if not exclusively, rely on that subjective belief in finding
that such contact was intentional rather accidental and was indecent rather than harmless. For that reason, and even without reference
to the other grounds of appeal, I am of the view that the conviction should be quashed on the basis of an error of law made in arriving
at it and also on the basis that it is neither safe nor satisfactory. 10.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to quash the conviction.",Date of Delivery of Judgment: 15 June 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1389.html,"

PD v. LTY [2018] HKCFI 1359; HCMP 455/2017 (20 June 2018),"24.  Although the Father originally sought video access to be increased to twice daily at 9:30 am and 9:00 pm Hong Kong time, he is now
prepared to forego the additional morning access (or to arrange earlier access) up to 3 mornings a week, in other words, I understand
that he is seeking access on 4 mornings a week, which the Mother agrees but wants to cancel the night access.  Her reason is that
access at 9 pm is too late and the Child would be tired by then.  However, the time was changed from 8 pm to 9 pm to accommodate
the Mother’s work hours and the time for her to get home to arrange for the access.  The time was agreed to by her on 31 October
2017. There has been no summons taken out by her to vary such access. 25.  Having considered the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the Father should be entitled to additional access, and
I am prepared to vary the 31.10.17 Order and make an order for the Father to have in addition to his access at 9 pm every night,

provides, the Hong Kong Court should not undertake any inquiry into the merits of the conviction in the underlying case.  That task

neither be contrary to the interests of justice nor cause any unfairness to the 1st Applicant. 47.  Given the above, the challenges raised by the 1st Applicant are devoid of merit and his application must be dismissed with costs

HKSAR v. SUM HO WAH HOWARD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1391; HCMA 187/2017 (22 June 2018),"41.  I have already quoted paragraphs 37 and 38 of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings in which he said (i) that he wholly rejected
the exculpatory parts of the 2nd Defendant’s video-recorded interview because he had “grave doubts whether the 2nd Defendant had told the whole truth” during that interview and (ii) that he “likewise” rejected the exculpatory things which
the 2nd Defendant had said upon arrest.  The exculpatory things which the 2nd Defendant said ought not to have been rejected unless the Magistrate felt sure, on the whole of the evidence, that there was no truth
in them.  On the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings as a whole, that may have been the basis on which the Magistrate actually proceeded.
 There is, however, no getting away from the fact the Magistrate had said in terms that he rejected the exculpatory parts of the
2nd Defendant’s video-recorded interview because he had “grave doubts” as to their truth and that he had “likewise” rejected
the exculpatory things which she had said upon arrest.  That being so, I am, all things considered, unable to regard any of the 2nd Defendant’s convictions as safe or satisfactory.  42.

JOE ZHIXIONG ZHOU v. SAIF PARTNERS II L.P. AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1448; HCCL 16/2016 (26 June 2018),"8.  The entitlement to recover any profit made by P from the investment made by CPCB-CF under the Xinrui investment agreement of 24
August 2007 conferred by the Court’s judgment is an entitlement conferred on D1 alone. That said, D2 will be well aware of the
contents of P’s affirmation and it is inevitable that D2 will become privy to further information and documents provided by P pursuant
to the order that I make herein. I have therefore concluded that both Defendants should be required to provide an express written
undertaking that any further information provided by P pursuant to the said order will be kept confidential save for its use in these
proceedings, which use shall be the sole use to which the information will be put. 9.  In my judgment, given P’s untruthful account of when he began to discuss a possible investment in Xinrui and the relative scarcity
of the discovery he provided for the trial, D1 is entitled to an order that goes wider than might have been conventionally appropriate
in setting the modalities for an account of secret profits to be given by a fiduciary. It is also the case that, since P did not
himself provide the alleged US$ 8million invested in Xinrui, the absence of any profit for CPCB-CF on the US$ 8 million investment
does not necessarily mean that P personally did not benefit financially in one way or another from the investment. 10.  With the considerations identified in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, I order as follows:",Date of Ruling: 26 June 2018(Sir Richard Field),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1448.html,"

AFFLUENT CONSTRUCTION CO LTD T/A PO LAM CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CO v. YU CHEUNG YIN [2018] HKCFI 1452; HCA 329/2016 (27 June 2018),"113.  A finding that the contractor was 46 days ahead in a 120 working days’ contract may appear impossible.  This result was reached
primarily because of the plaintiff’s foresight and efforts in mitigating the defendant’s mistake.  The plaintiff used extra strong
Type II sheet piles atextra costs in anticipation that approval for the use of this sheet piles would be given and carried on work
at its own risk before the suspension was ordered.  If approval were not given, the plaintiff would suffer double loss.  The use
of Type II sheet piles was approved.  The plaintiff’s foresight turned out to be correct and the extra costs well spent.  By assuming
the risk, the plaintiff gained time before suspension was ordered.  It deserves the credit for its foresight and assumption of risk.
 Even if I were to count the delay from 15 November 2012 instead of from 18 October 2012 (which will result in a reduction of 19
working days)[14], the plaintiff would still be comfortably within time by being 27 days ahead. Another reason was because the defendant took 26 days
to come up with a decision on the installation of the starter bars.  Accordingly, the defendant’s counterclaim must be dismissed. 114.  For the above reasons, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff on its claim for outstanding contract sum in the amount of $241,400

information from third parties such as banks and go to professionals such as accountants for assistance.  Despite the passage of

contract itself. Termination and discharge of the underlying agreement does not affect the validity and operation of the arbitration
agreement. There is accordingly no basis to argue that the arbitration agreement between the parties in this case has been terminated,
or is inoperable, by reason only of the abandonment or discharge of the Subcontract by breach. 8.  Plainly, there is a prima facie case of an arbitration agreement which covers the dispute which has arisen between the parties.
I am not satisfied that the arbitration agreement is inoperative. 9.  For these reasons, the Defendant’s application for stay of the action to arbitration is granted. The costs are to be paid by the

I proceeded on the basis that those two states of mind were distinct, separate and
inconsistent.  The convictions were not affirmed on the basis that such convictions can be based on both of those two states of mind.
 I treated the more serious state of mind as not having been found proved.  As to the less serious state of mind, I found no proper
basis on which to say that the Magistrate was not entitled to come to the conclusion the 1st Defendant was dealing with the sums concerned with at least reasonable grounds to believe that they in whole or in part represented

frivolous or vexatious, or otherwise an abuse of process.  If necessary, I would find that it is.  What the plaintiff has said, whether
in her affirmation filed in opposition of D3’s Summons or during the appeal hearing to me, do not assist her.  The fact that she
met D1 inside his office within the offices of D3 does not mean that D3 was a party to any agreement she might have reached with
D1. D1’s employment history with D3 equally does not of itself lead to any liability on D3’s part.  Then it was alleged and asserted
that D1 had said that somehow D3 would be involved as the lawyers to the deal.  Quite apart from the hopelessly vague nature of the
allegations, there is no elucidation from the plaintiff as to what D3’s alleged breaches were.  Those allegations and assertions
are incapable of reasoned argument, without foundation and cannot possibly succeed.  29.  By reasons of the above, and principally on the basis that the plaintiff’s proposed appeal lacks merits, I refuse to grant her
leave to appeal against Master J Wong’s Order out of time 30.  In respect of the costs of the present appeal, Mr D’Souza sought summary assessment.  I have considered the Statement of Costs
submitted to me.  The sum of HK$111,752 is claimed.  I have considered the particulars set out therein.  I am of the view that both

magistrate has the benefit of seeing and listening to the evidence.  Apart from the observation done by PW2 the policeman, the evidence
of PW1 (that he noticed a non‑local coming to collect the tablecloths at around 3:30 pm on the date in question) was important.
 The story given by the appellant and DW1 was indeed too incredible.  I am also of the view that their story was contrived in order
to explain why the appellant went to the restaurant with Cheung on board the MGV and why he was inside the restaurant and was seen
pushing a cage by PW2. 17.  I am also of the view that on the facts found by the magistrate, the only and irresistible inference to be drawn was that the appellant
was working there.  The evidence also points to the only and irresistible inference that the appellant was “employed” by someone
to work there. 18.  For these reasons, the conviction was not unsafe and I dismiss the appeal.",Date of Hearing and Judgment: 3 July 2018(Judianna Barnes),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1526.html,"

 No agreement was reached between the parties—hence this application. 7.  Having considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I am of the view that the litigation conduct on the part of R2, and the
total lack of utility and basis of her objection after sight of the OS and A’s affirmation in support constitute “special and
unusual feature” which justify the ordering of indemnity costs in respect of those incurred after A’s first affirmation in support. 8.  I will proceed to hear parties on the exact terms of the Order.","CHOW YUEN SHA (周婉莎)

if he was willing to conduct the interview.  He said he was.  At no time was it suggested that he told the officers that he did not
wish to take part in the interview—for whatever reason. 25.  The jury should be directed as they will be to consider the reliability of this interview and any admissions in it.  If they thought

ZHANG LAN AND OTHERS v. HERBERT SMITH FREEHILLS (A FIRM) [2018] HKCFI 1531; HCMP 285/2016 (4 July 2018),"8.  For the Appeal, I allow Mr Julian Copeman to claim an hourly rate of $4,000.  However, taking into account such seniority, the time
claimed by the Respondent is certainly excessive, in particular the Appeal was a rehearing of the Applicants’ application for taxation.
 The times involved in the perusal of documents and the preparation for the rehearing are excessive, and I doubt whether the Appeal
justifies the involvement of so many fee earners.   Having considered the nature of the Appeal, I summarily assess 75% of the Respondent’s
costs in the sum of $130,000. 9.  For the Stay Summons, I also agree that the costs claimed by the Respondent are excessive.  The summons is not a particularly complicated
one.   I only allow a sum of $70,000. 10.  For the Lifting of Stay Summons, by specifying no certificate for counsel, I expressly took the view that it was not necessary to
engage counsel to deal with the summons.  However, by not engaging counsel, the court should allow the Applicants’ solicitors to
charge more time for the preparation of the hearing.  Items D2 (communication with counsel) and G1 (counsel’s fees) are totally
disallowed.    However, I allow an additional sum of $10,000 for the preparation of the application.  The deductions for the other
items should not be substantial.  Overall, I summarily assess the Applicants’ costs in the sum of $45,000.","andHERBERT SMITH FREEHILLS (A FIRM)

In Universal Capital Bank v Hongkong Heya Co Ltd [2016] HKCFI 438; [2016] 2 HKLRD 757, in rejecting the defendant’s opposition on the basis that the plaintiff’s application was caught by the “fraud” exception,
Deputy High Court Judge Burrell said at [18(1)]: 15.  I find the latter observation equally apt in this instance.  Although a fraud perpetrated by unknown fraudster(s) is the underlying
reason why the plaintiff has suffered loss and commenced these proceedings, the plaintiff stresses that it does not have evidence,
and is not suggesting, that the 3rd defendant or those behind it were involved in such fraud.  The plaintiff has expressly confined its claim against the 3rd defendant to restitution based on unjust enrichment, to be approached in accordance with the framework set out by the Court of Final
Appeal in Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited [2004] HKCFA 21;  (2004) 7 HKCFAR 79 at  [67].  That is to say, all that the plaintiff has to say and prove is (1) that the 3rd defendant was enriched by having funds belonging to the plaintiff transferred into its account without having provided any consideration
therefor; (2) that such enrichment was at the expense of the plaintiff who did not intend the 3rd defendant to have, and who had no reason to pay the 3rd defendant, the funds; (3) that such enrichment was unjust as there was no legitimate reason for the 3rd defendant to have received the funds; and (4) that the 3rd defendant has not raised any defence that justifies it to keep the funds.  It is unnecessary for the plaintiff to, and it did not,
assert that the 3rd defendant received the funds in question fraudulently or dishonestly.  See paragraphs 33b, 35a, 37a, 40, 43, 44, 59c, 60c and 61c
of the amended statement of claim.  See also paragraph 8 of the 2nd affidavit of David Michael Wertheim. 16.  For these reasons, I make an order in terms of the draft judgment at pages 192-197 of the hearing bundle save that the words “when
it is no longer necessary” in the second preamble should be replaced by “once the plaintiff has recovered the sum of US$3,300,002

Tsang Tsang.  The summons and the documents in support have been served upon the defendant and ICBC.  The defendant has failed to
appear.  ICBC has also failed to respond. 5.  I have considered Order 32, rule 5 of the Rules of the High Court.  I bear in mind the fact that the defendant has all alone ignored
the legal proceedings against it.  I also bear in mind the fraudulent conduct alleged (and now taken to have been substantiated in
the light of the default judgment) against it.  I deem it expedient to proceed with this application in the absence of the defendant. 6.  I have considered the evidence filed before this Court.  I have considered the submissions made by Ms Fiona Chong.  I have considered
the authorities cited in support.  I have previously, echoing the warning made in previous authorities, observed that the powers
which the Court is now being invited to invoke have to be exercised with great caution.  It is important to maintain banker/customer
confidence.  I have on the other hand in Akbank TAS v Mainford Limited & Ors [2018] HKCFI 363 (unreported, HCA 3264/2016, 22 February 2018) observed that Hong Kong being an international city, the law should
be facilitative but not obstructive when a victim of a cybercrime comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the true culprits.
 It is a balancing exercise which the Court has to undertake.  In the present case, I note that the defendant has ignored all the
legal proceedings that have been brought against it.  In particular, it has failed to comply with the discovery order contained in
the Injunction, which specifically requires it to make certain disclosure in respect of the Account.  Such failure on the part of
the defendant to do so is in my mind an important consideration.  On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that an order in terms
of the Summons as briefly amended should be made.  I so order.","BRIGHT MOON INTERNATIONAL TRADE CO. LIMITED

no longer possible.  In my view, quite apart from the lateness of the application, and the distinct possibility of the trial dates
being upset (18 days having been reserved from 9 October 2018), allowing the application will cause prejudice and unfairness to the
defendants, and in particular to the estate of the Deceased and D2, which cannot be put right by costs. 12.  In all the circumstances, and having balanced them, I refuse the application. 13.

materials such as wafer substrates, chemicals and back-metal gold, which led to severe decline in production volume, and to carry
on its business generally. Whilst I accept RCL’s finances were tight (which was already a known fact at the time of the Sales Commitment)
and gold was at times short for a day or so, it was not the case there were no monies to buy materials, and plainly the decline in
production was attributable largely to the problems with the Marketing Department as outlined above. 335.  I therefore dismiss EB’s claim against RCL in HCA1459/2012, and grant judgment in favour of RCL on its counterclaim against EB
for (a) a declaration that the 20/5/11 Document was not legally binding on RCL and (b) a declaration that D was not indebted to EB

so form part of a broader strategy, which the relief if granted will advance, presentation of a petition under section 740 is an impermissible use of the jurisdiction.  The guileless admission of the purpose for presenting the petition in Re Astec[7] perhaps made the issue of principle seem rather simpler to Jonathan Parker J than, with respect, it seems to me to be.  For example,
I ask rhetorically, does it make a difference if Elliott as sophisticated investors anticipate that a desirable consequence of obtaining
the order they seek would probably be the Bank becoming a takeover target, as opposed to Elliott being motivated to some degree in
deciding to issue the Petition by a desire that the Bank becomes a takeover target?  Again asked rhetorically, what if the members
of the board of the relevant members of the Elliott Group, whilst all agreeing to a resolution that the Petition should be presented,
had varying views on why this should be done? 11.  Mr Yu submitted that if I were to find against him I should not deal with the factual and legal arguments advanced before me other
than in general terms as it might unhelpfully influence the way in which the parties prepared their cases if the matter proceeds

in the case of the collateral purpose issue Mr Sussex invited me to do, and I agree with Mr Yu that to produce a detailed reasoned

AMUSE PEACE LTD v. CHINA CITY CONSTRUCTION (INTERNATIONAL) CO. LTD [2018] HKCFI 1644; HCA 2913/2016 (16 July 2018),"28.  It is not disputed that the Loan was advanced, and was not repaid. The assertion of the Security Agreement is rejected as unbelievable.
There is no defence to the claim made under the Cheque, on the alleged basis of total failure of consideration. The cases relied
upon by Leading Counsel for CCC International are totally distinguishable and are inapplicable to the facts of the present case.
In Tan Khay Chuen v Ko Ping Shun Benson CACV 238/2015, 8 July 2016, the consideration relied upon to support the claim under the cheque issued to the 2nd plaintiff was the guarantee, and there was a genuine triable issue as to whether the guarantee issued by the defendant to the 1st plaintiff had been discharged. In Lomax Leisure Ltd (in liq) v Miller [2007] EWHC 2508 (Ch), the court held, on the peculiar facts of the case, that there was no consideration for the cheques issued for dividends, since there
was no antecedent debt, or liability of the liquidators sued, to be absolved. In our present case, the consideration for the Cheque
is clearly the Loan, and there is no dispute that the Loan was advanced by Amuse, received by CCC International, and remains unpaid. 29.  Whether the evidence of Zhang - that he did not know Zhong nor the wider transactions involving the RMB Loan - is in fact believable,
is not in my view material to the consideration of whether CCC International has shown a bona fide defence, when the nature of the
claims made in the SOC and the disputed issues raised in the Defence are borne in mind. 30.  For all the above reasons, summary judgment should be entered in favor of Amuse, for the outstanding Loan of HK$540 million, interest
thereon at 1.5% per month from 17 June 2016 to the date of judgment, and further interest from the date of judgment, at judgment
rate, until payment, together with the costs of the action (including the costs of and incidental to the application for summary

under paragraph 5 of the amended defence and counterclaim.  The supporting affirmation has not really added much to the matter. 46.  Had the plaintiff indicated consent (or no opposition) to the Amendment Summons at the CMC, any dispute over costs could and would
have been dealt with there and then without the need for another hearing.  So analysed, if one gets to the root of the matter, the
view can be legitimately taken that the Hearing was ultimately necessitated by the plaintiff’s failure to consent to the Amendment
Summons at the CMC.  Consequently, the Master did not act unreasonable or err in law in awarding the costs of the Hearing to the
defendants. 47.  For these reasons, I dismiss the Appeal. I also make an order nisi that the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs of and occasioned by the Appeal, to be taxed on a party and party basis if
not agreed with a certificate for counsel for the hearing before me.",(Lisa Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1657.html,"

ACROPOLIS LTD v. THE HONGKONG &AMP; SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 1670; HCMP 1031/2018 (16 July 2018),"10.  As far as I can see, the Summons serves no substantive purpose.  The orders applied for thereunder overlap completely with the orders sought under the OS.  The inference that I draw is
that the plaintiff took out the Summons solely to squeeze its application onto the list of the summons judge on the next available
summons day so as to get a quick disposal.  It did so by indorsing the margin of the Summons with a reference to Order 29 rule 1 when none of the orders applied for is within the scope of Order 29.  The citation of Order 29 rule 1 is misleading, and I say, deliberately so. 11.  Such procedural manoeuvre is inexcusable.  There is no urgency in the application.  The availability of the information / documents
sought by the plaintiff is not going to be prejudiced by the normal waiting time for a hearing.  The petition in HCCW 218/2017 has
not yet been set down for trial. 12.  No doubt the plaintiff has anticipated the Banks to adopt a neutral stance and hoped that the court would somehow overlook the procedural
irregularities.  This kind of mentality should be discouraged. That the plaintiff may eventually obtain the information / documents
it desires is neither here nor there.  It is wrong as a matter of principle to allow a party to retain, or benefit from, an advantage
that it has obtained solely through abusing the process of the court, especially where the abuse appears to be intentional.",(Lisa Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1670.html,"

gear covered by regulation 18A.  The argument that a sling used in raising or lowering a load is not regulated by the regulation
because it is made of fibre cannot hold water. 55.  Accordingly, I find all the grounds of appeal fail. 56.  The Magistrate’s interpretation that the fibre slings used in this case fall within the ambit of regulation 18A(a) is plainly
correct.  The conviction is neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory.  The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.",Date of Judgment: 17 July 2018(C P Pang),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1640.html,"

and that P had to come to this Court before obtaining some documents.  I am prepared to reconsider the matter of costs.  Having said
this, I am still of the view that Ds are largely successful in resisting a greater part of the Discovery Summons and I am only prepared
to vary the Order Nisi to the extent that P is to pay 80% of Ds’ costs.  As for the costs of this application, I will similarly

BAOSTEEL ENGINEERING &AMP; TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO LTD v. CHINA ZENITH CHEMICAL GROUP LTD [2018] HKCFI 1678; HCCT 7/2018 (18 July 2018),"10.  In my view, BS as the judgment creditor under the Award will be unfairly prejudiced if enforcement of the Award in Hong Kong is
delayed by reason of some claim made by another party, HH, on the Mainland, on the basis that it may result in a Mainland judgment
in the indefinite future, and which may give rise to BS’ liability to pay to HH an amount which exceeds the sum payable by CZ to
BS under the Award.  There is no evidence that BS will not be in a position to pay under any Mainland judgment, if and when such
judgment is issued.  At most, CZ claims that even if HH can recover the PRC Judgment Debt from BS on the Mainland, due to foreign
exchange controls on the Mainland, HH would not be able to reimburse CZ in Hong Kong. 11.  Although CZ is a company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Exchange, BS claims that there are concerns about CZ as a going
concern, and this is evidenced by CZ’s own 2017 Annual Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements, its directors’ views
on the future liquidity and financial position of CZ and its group, and by its qualified 2017-2018 Report and the Consolidated Financial
Statement.  12.  Balancing all the foregoing matters, I was only prepared, with some reluctance, to order a temporary stay of enforcement on the
Award for a period of 6 months from 11 July 2018, conditional upon CZ’s provision of security in Hong Kong, by payment into court
of the full amount of the Award, calculated to be RMB 19,818,046, or the provision of a bank guarantee for such sum.  If security
could not be duly provided within 14 days, the application for stay of execution is discharged.  Liberty was given to both parties
to apply to vary, lift or continue the stay, if the status of the Mainland proceedings is rendered more certain after the end of
July 2018 and if the Mainland proceedings can be seen to progress without prejudice to CZ’s interests in the timely enforcement
of the Award in Hong Kong.  Costs were ordered to be paid by CZ to BS.","CHINA ZENITH CHEMICAL GROUP LIMITED

valuation and purchase without at least some evidence from the Li parties (as Petitioners) as to the current state of the business

on the other’s case.  However, I consider that the overall costs in the Ownership Action and on the Petition are likely to have

MORAL LUCK FINANCE LTD v. CHEUNG KWAI YIN [2018] HKCFI 1795; HCMP 1306/2017 (20 July 2018),"8.  On 13 July 2018, with her 2nd affirmation of 10 July 2018 in support, the applicant applied for and obtained before Wong J what is in effect a re-grant of the
23/6/17 Mareva Injunction (the “13-7-18 Mareva Injunction”). The ceiling of the restrained amount was, in accordance with the amount of the costs allowed, adjusted to HK$2,967,105.60. 
I note that on 7 June 2018, the applicant applied for Legal Aid.  That accounts for the slight delay in the making of the application
before Wong J. 9.  I have read the 2nd affirmation of the applicant.  I have read the authorities cited to me, which include Menno Leendert Vos v Global Fair Industrial Ltd & others HCA 4200/1995(unreported, 25 March 2010).  I have heard counsel for the applicant.  I note that this is in effect an application
for a post-judgment Mareva injunction.  The existence of a good arguable case is not in doubt.  Given the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the plaintiff
as outlined above, including the failure on the part of the plaintiff to make disclosure in aid as ordered by the 23/6/17 Mareva
Injunction, and in the absence of any evidence in opposition from the plaintiff, a serious risk of dissipation can in my view be
inferred.  The balance of convenience is also in favour of the continuation of the 13-7-18 Mareva Injunction.  However, whilst I
am prepared to continue the 13‑7‑18 Mareva Injunction pending initiation of execution process, I am not prepared to order it
to be continued indefinitely.  In my view, it is not appropriate to do so—see Republic of Haiti v Duvalier [1990] 1 QB 202, per Staughton LJ at 214G–H.  While the applicant will need some protection in terms of the 13-7-18 Mareva Injunction at this stage,
she should avail herself of the usual execution mechanism in due course.  I will proceed to hear Mr Ma on the duration. 10.  The Injunction granted by Wong J on 17 July 2018 be continued until 16 July 2019 unless before then it is varied or discharged by

petition, the board could then resolve to apply to appoint provisional liquidators.  I do not think that that application would run
into the Emmadart problem.  8.  I am satisfied that, subject to the issue that I have discussed, this is a proper case to appoint provisional liquidators.  It also
seems to me that as the board of the Company is presently involved in a restructuring exercise it is probable that any order appointing
provisional liquidators could at its inception legitimately include restructuring powers. Generally, the present practice of the
Company’s Court is that orders appointing provisional liquidators do not initially contain restructuring powers; those are only
introduced after the provisional liquidators have familiarised themselves with the affairs of the Company and if they make an application
to extend their powers. 9.  I will, therefore, adjourn the application.  It may be that any further application has to be heard by another judge.",Date of Decision: 24 July 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1755.html,"

 However, parties’ submissions have not been focused on that issue.  I have not had any submissions on what differences the adoption
of the two Approaches would bring about, and the relevance of such differences.  I note further the non-committing stance Mr Chong
took at paragraphs 38 and 39 of his written submissions, that: 42.  The Court is requested to rule on the application before it.  It is an application for specific performance.  It is not an application
for any declaratory relief on the meaning of any terms of the Settlement Agreement (if one can be made).  It was not prepared and
presented as such.  The Court is cautious that it should not be, and should not be perceived to be, rewriting the Settlement Agreement
for want of clarity.  In the circumstances, I form the view that I should merely dismiss the application for the reasons explained
above.  43.  I consider that this is an appropriate case to adopt the approach of costs to follow the event.  I made an order nisi that the costs of and incidental to this application, including that of the adjourned hearing of 18 January 2018, should be paid
by D1 to P1 and P2, to be taxed if not agreed.","CHEUNG SIU LING

to the additional evidence with its own.  Given the difficulties in identifying a suitable witness who can speak to the banking practice

the Joint Account. She could have kept the remaining monies of $7,244,594.19 (ie $17,244,594.19 (Sole Account Monies) - $10,000,000.00
(Per Capita Shares for the Siblings)) in the Sole Account and asked the Son to “manage” the same as before. The fact the Mother
took the step to close the Sole Account and open the Joint Account clearly indicated a different intention and a change from the
previous arrangement. Alternatively, the Mother could have transferred the entire sum of $7,244,594.19 to the Son for him to “manage”
the same on her behalf without the trouble of opening the Joint Account in the name of Vicky and the Son. Alternatively, the Mother
could have placed such sum in the Joint Account and let the Son and Vicky to manage such monies on her behalf. In my view and as
Mr Wong submitted, the deliberate split of the sum of $7,244,594.19 into 2 parts (ie the Son Transfer and the Sole Account Balance)
with different treatment strongly suggested they were for different purposes and plainly supported my conclusion there was no trust
in respect of the Son Transfer. 239.  By reason of the above findings and conclusions, it is unnecessary for me to consider the interesting arguments raised by Mr Yau

effectively, they would have travelled an entire circle, after having wasted a good deal of time and costs.  Assuming that it is
within the power of this court to have these matters send back to the CA, I see no good reason so to do, not to mention further delay.
 This suggestion is therefore also rejected. 16.  Finally, it must be made clear that, with the resources at their disposal, the Defendants are in the position to obtain whatever
legal advice they desire.  No doubt they would conduct their case as they see fit, but they must accept the legal consequences which
flow from their conduct.  It is not the function of the court to preserve their options. 17.  I consider Aldi Stores to be inapplicable to this case.  In any case, it would not be possible or appropriate for this court to “manage” the case on

On behalf of the Receiver Ms Lam relied on certain passages in Palmer’s Company Law, paras 15.696 and 15.696.1 to suggest that a liquidator is deprived of his right of relief against the assets of the company only
if his conduct is in some way blameworthy.  I have to say it is not clear to me that those passages are intended to refer to the
expenses of litigation between the liquidator and the company itself.  In fact, in Re The Grande Holdings Ltd [2018] HKCFI 507, referred to at §37 of my decision dated 8 June 2018, I have ascertained from the court file of that case that
Harris J actually made an order that the provisional liquidators “shall personally pay” the investor’s and the company’s
costs of the appeal from the Master to be taxed if not agreed. 11.  It seems to me there is no usual rule in the present kind of case that the receiver should be indemnified as to all costs. Nor is
there a general rule that a fiduciary can litigate unsuccessfully against the beneficiary at the latter’s expense.  Contrary to
my initial impression, the point of principle is not entirely novel, having regard to the authorities referred to in my decision.
 In all the circumstances of this case I fail to see why costs should not follow the event.  Taking into account, however, that none
of the authorities relied upon in paras 28 to 33 and 35 to 38 of my decision nor Order 30 r 5 was cited by counsel or drawn to the
attention of the Receiver earlier by the Association, and the lateness of the Association’s application due to its own internal
problems, I consider that the Association should only have half of its costs.  12.  There will accordingly be an order that the Receiver do pay half of the Association’s costs of the application including the costs
of the argument on costs (without indemnity from the Association’s assets), with a certificate for junior counsel, to be taxed

CHINA REAL ESTATES INVESTMENT HOLDINGS LTD v. GOLD BLESS INTERNATIONAL INVEST LTD [2018] HKCFI 1868; HCCT 46/2017 (8 August 2018),"9.  Essentially, what Mr Yu is saying is: I want to find out if there was any possible wrongdoing by the director of the Respondent
which can be raised to constitute an arguable defence to the claims made by the Applicant under the agreement which is the subject
matter of the arbitration leading to the Award, which is now being enforced.  That is clearly impermissible fishing, and cannot be
the basis of a discovery order.  To borrow the phrase used in Lady Anne Tennant v Associated Newspapers Group Ltd which was in the context of O 14 proceedings, Mr Yu is only seeking to investigate alleged obscurities in the hope that something
will turn up on the investigation, and his case at this stage remains in the realm of mere surmise. 10.  Further, Mr Yu already obtained from the BVI court, the forum where the Respondent is incorporated, an order for documents to be
provided by Mr Yang, which covers the same scope of the documents sought in these proceedings.  Mr Yang has made disclosure of some
of the documents and has filed an affirmation to state that he is not in possession of any other documents.  As Mr Yang rightly pointed
out, if Mr Yu contends (and can establish) that there are further documents in existence and in Mr Yang’s possession, he can take
further action in the BVI court to compel discovery or for contempt. Bearing in mind the underlying objectives of the CJR, I am not
satisfied that an order for discovery of the type now sought is either necessary in these proceedings for disposing fairly of the
cause or matter, or for saving costs, or is in any way proportionate, or procedurally economical. 11.  I agree that the wide and unwarranted scope of the discovery sought, on suspicion and speculation, lacking in particulars of the

梁頌恆 v. 立法會主席 [2018] HKCFI 1869; [2018] 5 HKC 138; HCAL 1160/2018 (14 August 2018),"22.  There is one other problem in Mr Leung’s application in HCAL 1160/2018 for interim relief that I should mention. The Legco President
is named as the respondent to the application, and the relief sought is an order for a “stay of execution” of the Bill.  I am
given to understand that, by seeking a “stay of execution” (暫緩執行) of the Bill, Mr Leung is asking the court to grant
an order to restrain the coming into force of the Ordinance.  That being the application, it seems obvious that the proper respondent
to the application should be the Secretary for Transport and Housing, who is empowered by Section 1(2) of the Ordinance to appoint
a day for the coming into operation of that Ordinance by notice, or the Government of the HKSAR.  In this regard, it should be recognised
that the Secretary for Transport and Housing is not a subordinate of the Legco President, and does not act under his order or direction.
 Once the Bill has been passed by the Legco, the Legco President has no further role to play in relation to the coming into force
of the Ordinance.  In my view, it is clear the application for interim relief should not have been made against the Legco President.
 I should mention, to be fair to Mr Leung, that he made it clear, at the hearing as well as in a previous letter dated 2 August 2018,
that he was not seeking any order against the Legco President personally by the present application, although he maintained that
the Legco President was responsible for the passing of the Bill in the Legco. 23.  In all, I have reached the clear conclusion that the applications for interim relief should be refused. 24.  For the foregoing reasons, the Applicants’ two summonses dated 16 July 2018 are dismissed, with costs to the Chief Executive/Secretary
for Justice and the President of the Legislative Council respectively to be taxed if not agreed.  I do not consider the circumstances
of the present case are such as would justify an order for indemnity costs against Mr Leung as sought by Mr Tang for the Legco President.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1869.html,"

I also agree with Mr Tang that by the time of second decision, the learned judge was functus in relation to his first decision and as the Court of Appeal had noted the only avenue open to the applicant was through judicial
review.  Further, it is my view that the forfeiture of the entire bail money is not disproportionate as at the time when the first
decision was made.  It was clear that the applicant had voluntarily absented himself, not only from court but from Hong Kong. 29.  At the end of the day, I cannot say therefore that the learned judge was in error in forfeiting the bail money. I have therefore
no hesitation in dismissing this application to quash the first and second decisions of the learned judge and to dismiss the application

LCYP v. JEK [2018] HKCFI 1907; HCMC 3/2018 (16 August 2018),"153.  Having considered the above, I agree with the Wife, the Husband has so far failed to comply with his obligation to make a full,
frank and clear disclosure of his financial position.  His disclosures have been piecemeal and he provided information only when
asked.  His lack of clear disclosure as to his financial position, in particular the source of the payments for his legal costs in
the past of HK$23.5m and the source for payment of his future estimated costs of another HK$5m has led this Court to draw an inference
against him that he has undisclosed financial resources of at least some $20m in the past.      154.  In the above circumstances, I have come to the view that the Husband has the ability to pay the amount of HK$3.5m.  I thus order
the Husband to pay a sum of HK$3.5m to the Wife’s solicitors to be applied towards the Wife’s legal costs up to conclusion of
trial, payable by monthly instalments of HK$500,000 each, to be added to the Wife’s MPS over a period of 7 months commencing from
September 2018 until March 2018.  Any amounts paid by the Husband towards provision of the Wife’s legal costs shall be taken into
account by this Court in any final order for ancillary relief. 155.  The Wife has succeeded in her application. I order the Husband to pay her costs of and incidental to this application, such costs
to be summarily assessed and paid within 14 days of assessment by this Court.  The Wife is to lodge her statement of costs within
14 days, and the Husband to file his list of objections within 7 days thereafter.",(Bebe Pui Ying Chu)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1907.html,"

TSE FUNG CHIU v. KWOK CHEUNG HING AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1978; HCMP 3419/2016 (16 August 2018),"2.  The applicant in these circumstances predictably seeks his costs.  The underlying issue appears to be this:  There is no dispute
that the Company was required to convene an annual general meeting and lay before the Company audited financial statements for the
periods in respect of which orders were sought.  The sole director of the Company, who is the 1st respondent in both sets of proceedings and was a relatively newly appointed director, faced difficulties in providing the auditors
with all the financial documentation they required in order to complete the audit, in particular in relation to certain director’s
loans.  It seems to me that in the circumstances that the director faced, it was inevitable if the problems were going to be resolved
in accordance with the mechanisms contained in the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622) for the Company at some point to make an application to the court to extend the time for convening the annual general meeting
and laying audited financial statements before the Company at it.  It seems to me, in these circumstances, that the most equitable
way of dealing with costs is simply to provide that the costs of both the applicant and the 1st respondent are paid out of the assets of the 2nd respondent.  3.  Whilst one may, if one descends into the facts, be able to find matters which each party might suggest indicate that the other party
has some responsibilities for the practical problems that led to the delay in the annual general meeting being convened, it seems
to me that essentially all these relate to the affairs of the Company, which would appear not to have been conducted in accordance
with the statutory scheme or terribly efficiently, and that in these circumstances it is appropriate that the Company bears the costs
that both parties incurred in respect of both originating summonses. 4.  I will order that the 2nd respondent in each proceeding pays the applicant and the 1st respondent’s costs forthwith with a certificate for counsel.  I will make the same order in respect of the hearing before me today.",Date of Decision: 16 August 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1978.html,"

Second, I also do not accept that delay itself is a sufficient ground to deny Zhongtai’s application for summary judgment.[8]  It is certainly unsatisfactory for Zhongtai to make the summary judgment application nearly 16 months after the filing of the Defence
by China Kingstone, but this would not be a sufficient reason to deny summary judgment if the application has merit. Unfortunately,
there is none in the present case. 48.  For the above reasons, I dismiss Zhongtai’s application for summary judgment.  As China Kingstone has an arguable defence to Zhongtai’s
claim, there is no basis for the court to order China Kingstone to make any interim payment to Zhongtai before trial.  I therefore
dismiss the application for interim payment as well.   49.  I also make a costs order nisi that Zhongtai do pay to China Kingstone the costs of the applications, which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the

As Arden LJ (as she then was) in Buhr v Barclays Bank [2001] EWCA Civ 1223;  [2002] BPIR 25 observes in [50] of her judgment: 13.  It, therefore, follows that even if my construction of the charge is incorrect, as a matter of common law, the proceeds of the sale
would be treated as subject to the charge created over the underlying asset.  This being the case, it follows that the payment on
7 January 2016 was out of charged assets and, therefore, did not constitute a disposition of the property of the Company.  The application
in respect of the second payment, therefore, also fails. 14.  I will, therefore, dismiss the summons and hear counsel on costs.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2057.html,"

RE LEUNG LAI CHING MARGARET [2018] HKCFI 1910; HCB 771/2018 (23 August 2018),"15.  This cannot be what the statutory framework permits as a valid ground for not making the bankruptcy order in relation to a debt
which is payable immediately. 16.  Whilst a bankruptcy order, by operation of law, has its consequence on the transactions of the debtor, and thus the agreements she
has entered into with the Mainland third party, it is not apparent from the terms of those agreements that this per se must frustrate
the deal from the point of view of the debtor’s Mainland counterpart.  If the transaction is proved to be genuine and has the potential
as projected by the debtor, I am sure the trustee in bankruptcy will engage in the necessary investigation and take the necessary
step to ensure that this could benefit the creditors and the estate of the debtor in her bankruptcy. 17.  I therefore found it right to make the usual bankruptcy order with costs, including costs reserved, to be taxed if not agreed. 
For the avoidance of doubt, I put on record the undertaking of the petitioner to give up such security that he still holds in the
form of shares in a number of the debtor’s companies subject to the charging order obtained by the petitioner in 2016 and not covered
by the subsequent order for sale.  They were set out in the schedule to the amended petition.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 23 August 2018(Simon Leung),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1910.html,"

For this issue, I accept Ms Lau’s submission and I agree with what was said by DHCJ Leung in the Ye Jinxiang case, the wording of the 7 Scenarios ensures that there is no overlap. 104.

a counterclaim. There has been no cross-petition filed in the present case, and no appeals were involved.   Mr Cheng cannot be said
to fall within Subparagraph (ia). 105.  In light of what I have said, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Cheng’s application has to be dismissed.  Mr Cheng has succeeded

plant and materials incurred.  It would appear on the face of the Award that there was in fact evidence of that, in the evidence
reviewed by the experts.  At this stage, I consider that the Arbitrator’s decision, of allowing costs not incurred by the Defendant
in his valuation of the variation as “fair and reasonable”, to be at least open to serious doubt. 51.  I grant leave to the Plaintiffs to appeal on the questions identified as questions 2 and 4.  Since the matter will proceed to the
2nd stage of determination on the merits of the appeal, I have refrained from making further comments on the substance of the appeal,
save for stating the reasons why I considered that the threshold of “at least open to serious doubt” was met on the relevant
questions of law. 52.  The costs of the application for leave will be in the cause of the appeal.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2001.html,"

CARGO CHANNEL SERVICES LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. HANJIN SHIPPING CO LTD [2018] HKCFI 1879; HCA 1919/2016 (31 August 2018),"31.  I decline to accept the submissions of Ms. Gwilt.  As a matter of procedure, it appears that parties did not have the 2-stages test
clearly in mind in pursing and defending the application.  However, for the present purpose, it does not make much difference.  In
my view, parties were still in the first stage as appearing before me as there was no direction or order from the court that the
plaintiff had satisfied its burden at the 1st stage. In the present hearing, the plaintiff has failed to do so.  Alternatively, if it happened that parties had already entered
into the second stage, BCC also showed cause to my satisfaction that the wasted costs order should not be made in the circumstances.
 Apart from the finding of facts as in paragraph 28 above, I specifically decline to accept the submission that I could draw a bad
inference upon BCC from the conduct of Ms. Chark when she argued that she could sign the statement of truth for her client. Although
I did reject her argument and/or interpretation of O.41A r.3 RHC, it does not necessarily mean that she took it to delay the proceedings.
Without more, a simple rejection or non-acceptance of a legal argument put forward by a legal representative shall not be taken as
that he or she is advancing such argument with bad intention.          32.  As to costs, I do not have the benefit of the parties of their argument.  However, it appears to me that no order as to costs appear
to be the appropriate one in the circumstances.  The suspicion on the part of the plaintiff’s solicitors turns out to be true.
It has triggered the investigation on the part of BCC. The trustee did rectify, if necessary, the action of BCC. Without it, the
question whether BCC did act, at some point in time, with or without authority could become more complicated.    33.  To conclude, the summons is dismissed with an order nisi of no order as to costs.","Hanjin Shipping Company Limited

HAI KUO SHIPPING 1201 LTD v. EVERWIN SHIPPING (HONG KONG) CO LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1906; HCAJ 79/2014 (31 August 2018),"7.  The trial of this action took place on 11 July 2018.  A Notice of Trial was issued to the parties on 24 August 2017.  However, neither
the 2nd Defendant nor the 3rd Defendant appeared at the trial.  One Mr Zhu appeared in court and said that he was a director of and represented the 1st Defendant.  No leave from the court had been obtained by the 1st Defendant to be represented by a director.  Therefore, there was no proper representation of the 1st Defendant. 8.  The trial proceeded with the Plaintiff calling its evidence to prove its case.  The Plaintiff’s case was straightforward and based
on contractual documents.  Given the absence of the Defendants, no defence or counterclaim was made out.  The court was satisfied
that the Plaintiff had proved its case against each of the Defendants.  9.  Clarifications were sought with the Plaintiff’s counsel on the details of the calculations of its loss and on its interest and
costs entitlements.  In particular, the Agreement did not unequivocally provide for an obligation on the part of the 2nd Defendant for default interest from 25 April 2014, nor did it clearly provide for the 2nd Defendant’s obligation to indemnify the Plaintiff’s costs[2].

"RE SNG ALLAN, ALSO KNOWN AS SNG HOCK SENG [2018] HKCFI 2016; HCB 3651/2018 (31 August 2018)","5.  The petitioner had indeed put a nil value on the shares in the petition pursuant to s 6B(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 6).  The respondent did not argue that such estimates were a sham or that the statutory demand (which also estimated a nil value)
failed to comply with rule 44(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules, despite the fact that Cheng Hung Kit v Tsoi Chik Sang Lawrence [2018] HKCA 396, a recent decision concerning that rule, had been mentioned by Mr Oh on behalf of the petitioner to be distinguished.
 In any event it is well established that the petitioner is bound by the estimated value of the security put in a petition, and cannot
take any benefit in the administration of the bankruptcy except on the basis of that estimate. 6.  Mr Yim asserted that if the shares had been realised earlier at the time of the default, the proceeds of sale would have been sufficient
to meet the outstanding indebtedness. There was no evidence to support this, or even any numbers obtained from publicly available
sources. But this was in any event quite immaterial, as there was no arguable case that the petitioner breached any duty in not selling
the shares at that time.  So far as the statutory demand was concerned, rule 44(5) required the demand to state the value of the security as at the date of the demand.  As at that date (namely, 15 March 2018), the
shares had of course long been suspended from trading.  7.  For these reasons, I did not see any point in having expert evidence as submitted by the respondent.  The usual bankruptcy order
was accordingly made.","Ex-Parte:

 The fact that Mr Lou was permitted in standing on the elevated platform with the yellow banner and assisting in the dismantle of
the platform suggest to me that he could not have happened to be present in the Area by coincidence because he lived nearby as a
street sleeper.  Together with other protestors, wooden racks forming the elevated platform were taken away from the middle of Arygle
Street. Had Mr Lou wanted to leave the scene, he could have done so after removing the wooden racks.  Video footage however depicted
his return to the Area despite all the opportunities opened to him to do otherwise. 45.  At approximately 2:51 pm, Mr Lou was seen having a cake in the forefront of the police check line with his back facing the police.
 One can see the lady who distributed the cake to Mr Lou had no difficulty in manoeuvring herself through the crowd.  Even as late
as this juncture, Mr Lou could have left the Area with ease for in front of him was only a loose pack of protestors and journalists,

the length of time that Mr Lou chose to remain in the Area, the extensiveness of his involvement and his knowledge about the intended
clearance operation, I have no doubt that Mr Lou together with other fellow protestors decided deliberately to defy the request made
by the Plaintiff’s solicitors, the bailiffs and the police.  His presence and conducts with other fellow protestors made the job
of the clearing and removing the obstructions substantially more difficult, if not impossible.  His acts and conducts were not only
inherently likely to, but factually calculated to, delay if not to frustrate, the bailiffs and the Plaintiff’s agents’ efforts.

of assembly, demonstration and expression fails to meet the “prescribed by law” requirement.  As the Court of Appeal observed
(at §57 of their judgment), s 104C is not a free‑standing provision.  The power to remove bills or posters under s 104C(1) is
premised on their being displayed in contravention of s 104A(1).  Accordingly, the Decisions, which were all taken under s 104C(1),
cannot stand.  There will be an order for certiorari to quash the Decisions. 109.  In their Forms 86 the applicants sought a declaration that s 104A does not prohibit or require approval to be obtained for reasonable
display of banners or placards at moving or static demonstrations.  In his submissions Mr Harris said that the word “reasonable”
was not necessary.  He also proposed an alternative declaration that s 104A(1)(b) does not apply to any bill or poster displayed
and attended to at any demonstration.  I decline to grant any of these declarations, which seem to me geared towards the applicants’
construction argument which was rejected by the Court of Appeal. 110.  There will be an order nisi that the respondents pay the costs of the applicants with a certificate for two counsel, and that the applicants’ own costs be

SAT KAI CHUEN v. LAW CHI KUN AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2158; HCA 1827/2018 (31 August 2018),"9.  The basis for that is because the plaintiff’s case that a document recording the results of the election of the 2016 balloting
committee contained a signature of his which is forged.  The plaintiff does not seek to challenge the result of that election.  In
fact, he has signed that result record sheet as a member of the 2016 balloting committee but there was another space for him to sign
as the supervising member of that committee.  His allegation is that that signature is a forged one.  10.  Since he has signed as a member although not also as a supervising member, he must have been satisfied with the record of the result
as being accurate.  In any event, if the result of the election of the 2016 balloting committee is correct, then despite the record
of such result being tainted by a forged signature, which is contested, that tainted signature would not have tainted the actual
election result.  Therefore, I do not see any basis for saying that since the record of result has a tainted signature, therefore
the election result would become invalid ab initio.  It does not follow.  I therefore find that there is no serious question to be argued for relief No. 5.  11.  Since there is no serious question to be argued for relief No. 5, there is no basis to grant any interim relief to perpetrate that

of s 18 (4) of the Ordinance, in that it was promoted and well known to customers of the Plaintiffs who subscribe to the Plaintiffs’
home telephone line services.  These customers constitute a relevant sector of the public under s 1 (4) of Schedule 2 to the Ordinance.
 66.  However, in view of my findings that the Defendant’s use of the Marks in the Advertisements for comparative advertising do not
take unfair advantage of or is detrimental to the repute of the Marks, and constitute use in accordance with honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters under s 21, there is no infringement under s 18 (4) of the Ordinance. 67.  Having considered all relevant factors, including the fact that the Defendant’s use of the Marks in the Advertisements does not
take unfair advantage of the Marks, is not detrimental to the repute of the Marks, and is not such as to deceive the public, I find
that such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.  Since a defence under s 21 of the Ordinance

the two Petitions. 16.   The position is so crystal clear that I do not think that there is anyneed for me to deal with the allegations by the Debtor about
not being able to take out from the Baoan Court the judgment sum of RMB3,444,999.95 admittedly paid into that Court by Willwin SZ

SHUN HING ELECTRONIC HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER v. WONG PUI FAN [2018] HKCFI 2065; HCA 2417/2014 (10 September 2018),"55.  These Summonses are the two sides of the same coin.  Given the overlap between the 1st and the 2nd Actions, and the fact that Madam Wong and Perlie are carrying the burden of defending the 1st Action, I see no good reason not to have the Actions tried together.  Not doing so would inevitably result in further delay to the
resolution of these matters which go back many years.  I also agree with Mr Lam that to stay the 2nd Action would tantamount to having a split trial of liability and quantum, which is not justified.  56.  The breach of fiduciary duty claim in the 1st Action is struck out as indicated above.  The SOC Summons is dismissed.  No order is made in respect of the Stay Summons and Heard
Together Summonses.  I make an order nisi that the costs of and occasioned by the Strike Out Summons and the SOC Summons, including

For these reasons, I take the view that the Master was correct in striking out Mrs Michaels’ claims against all the defendants. 38.  The principles for Order 14 applications are, again, well established. The court will only grant summary judgment in a clear case
where there is no triable issue or arguable defence.  In view of my conclusion on the striking out applications, it must follow that
the Master was correct in dismissing the Order 14 application. 39.  Hence, I shall dismiss Mrs Michaels’ appeal against the Master’s Orders.  I shall also order that Mrs Michaels shall pay the
costs of and incidental to this appeal to be summarily assessed. Centaline, and Mr Chiu and Ms Pow, shall file their respective statements

On the other hand, as has been explained at paragraph 15/16/2 of Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018, Volume 1: 15.  I have considered the contents of the Statement of Claim.  The pleaded facts clearly support the plaintiff’s case that it is the
victim of an email fraud, and that it has suffered loss in the amount of the Sum.  It appears entitled to relief based on its proprietary
interest in the Sum.  I bear in mind the fact that declaratory relief is being sought.  I need to bear in mind the rules of practice
set out above and decide how I should exercise my discretion.  I take into account the fact that fraud is pleaded and deemed established.
 I take further into account the fact that nothing is known about the defendant, including whether it has any other creditors.  The
plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaratory relief sought, so as to avert any need for it to race against other creditors. 
Fairness justifies it.  I note further that the respondent is neutral to the application.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
that the facts of the present case are such that I should exercise my discretion in favour of granting the declaratory relief and
the vesting order sought. 16.  For the above reasons, I grant the Orders in terms of the Summons, as amended by me, together with costs of the action and this

to consider that my order made on 2 August 2018 should be reversed. The Applicant fails to show he has any reasonable ground to argue

TANG WING HUNG ALBERT FORMERLY KNOWN AS TANG SHUN TAI v. LAW CHAU FAT [2018] HKCFI 2127; HCA 929/2015 (21 September 2018),"31.  Mrs Chan next argued that even if the challenge to P’s locus standi in respect of his claim had been taken earlier, there would not have been much savings in costs since the proceedings in respect
of D’s counterclaim would mirror the parties’ respective contentions in P’s claim. However, at the stage, I am only concerned
with liability for costs, and not quantum of costs which is a matter for the taxing master. On the question of liability for costs,
I am unable to say that there would be no extra costs incurred at all for P’s claim that was outside the parameters of D’s counterclaim.
This is sufficient basis for the court to exercise its discretion to determine liability for costs in respect of P’s claim. However,
I hasten to add that the above observation does not in any way fetter the taxing master’s discretion and decision on assessing
taxed costs pursuant to any costs order that I make. 32.  Taking into account the above matters and all the circumstances of the case in respect of P’s claim, I consider that D should
be entitled to half of the costs of and occasioned by P’s claim. I therefore order P to pay half of D’s costs of and occasioned
by P’s claim in the present action, which costs included (a) costs of and occasioned by the 2nd PTR held on 31 August 2018, (b) half of the hearing time of the adjourned PTR held on 11 September 2018, and (c) all costs reserved
in respect of P’s claim, to be taxed if not agreed. 33.  Should P require translation of this judgment into punti language, he can contact my clerk to arrange an appointment for a court

existence of the customers concerned, or how those requests were generated.  Nor didhe attempt to explain the accounting system of
the defendant which recorded and generated the “history reports”.  I have reproduced above what PM&T said in their reply
dated 28 August 2018 concerning the “history reports”.  Not even those matters have been confirmed by affirmation. 18.  In paragraph 10 of Kan’s 7thAffirmation, Mr Kan talks about funds “which belong to the customers and held in the trust account”.  He has failed to explain
what “the trust account” is.  During a previous hearing, I enquired with Mr Chan, counsel for the defendant, as to whether all
clients’ monies were held in trust account or accounts.  If they were, the identification of those funds would have been straightforward.
 I was informed that they were unfortunately not.  If Mr Kan is now saying that they were, he ought to provide details. 19.  Given the state of the evidence, Mr Chan sensibly accepts that the Summons is not adequately supported by the evidence.  He seeks
leave to withdraw the same.  In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out above, I grant the defendant leave to withdraw the

TIME SQUARE LTD v. LEE KWUN KIT T/A JL MUSIC AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2296; HCA 2244/2018 (28 September 2018),"4.  The Court has power to grant an injunction against a defendant described not by name, but by reference to his conduct provided that
the description is sufficiently certain to identify those who are necessarily included and excludes those who are not: see Billion Star Development Ltd v Wong Tak Chuen [2012] HKCFI 142; [2012] 2 HKLRD 85, at paragraph 54 per Au J, and Bloomsbury Publishing plc v News Group Ltd [2003] EWHC 1205;  [2003] 1 WLR 1633 at paragraphs 15 – 22 per Sir Andrew Morritt VC. 5.  I have considered the description of the 2nd defendants.  On the Writ they are described as “Persons unlawfully occupying or remaining at the Open Piazza of Times Square, 1 Matheson Street, Causeway Bay by busking or any other form of street performance, or persons who cause,place or leave obstruction(s)
at the Open Piazza in connection with the carrying out of such performances”.  I am satisfied that the description is sufficiently
certain.  Given the fact that the 2nddefendants is a class of persons not described by names, it is obvious that it is impracticable to serve any process or court document
on them in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the High Court.  I am also satisfied that the proposed means ofsubstituted service
(namely (1) in so far as the Writ and the Order permitting substituted service are concerned, by (a) fixing the same securely at
a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza, (b) by advertisement in one local Chinese newspaper and one local English newspaper; and
(c) by posting the same advertisements on the Website of Times Square; (2) in so far as this Summons and all subsequent orders are
concerned (including those which the 1stdefendant is required to serve upon the 2nddefendants), by (a) fixing those court documents securely at a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza; and (b) posting notices of the
same on the website of Times Square) are appropriate and adequate.  I grant the Order sought as amended. 6.  I however make clear that this Order only permits substituted service of the Writ, the Summons and all subsequent documents which
require service.  No injunction against the 2nd defendants has been granted.  That remains to be considered as and when any application for one is made (if one is made).","Date of Decision:

COMPANY A AND OTHERS v. COMPANY D AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2240; HCCT 31/2018 (3 October 2018),"56.  In any event, I accept the submissions made on behalf of the 3rd Defendant, that the purported expert evidence on Thai law which is sought to be relied upon by the Plaintiffs is inadmissible.  There
is no declaration by the expert, as required under Order 38 rule 37C (1).  The requirements of Order 38 rule 37 should be observed
in all cases where expert evidence is to be relied upon (see China Medical v KPMG, HCCW 435/2012, 24 February 2016, at paras 51 to 54), and there is no justification for parties and their advisers to be cavalier
about compliance with the provisions of Order 37 on expert evidence. 57.  The above matters are in my view sufficient to dispose of the application for receivership, and there is no need to deal in detail
with the Defendants’ and the 3rd Defendant’s claims of the adverse effect which they may suffer as a result of a receivership order on the Thai Co Shares, which
I agree cannot be ignored. 58.  For all the above reasons, the application for the appointment of receivers was refused at the conclusion of the hearing on 2 August

of Service has been filed.  Nor any defence. 6.  I have considered Order 32, rule 5 of the Rules of the High Court.  The defendant and its shareholder/director have chosen to take
no step in the defence of the action.  I have also considered the nature of the application before me.  A default judgment is more
often than not sought in the absence of the defendant.  I find it expedient in the circumstances to proceed with the application
despite the absence of the defendant. 7.  I have considered the submissions of Ms Pang who appears for the plaintiffs.  I have considered the appropriate approach when deciding
whether a default judgment should be granted: Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018 §19/7/11.  I have considered the authorities cited to me, which include Re Ping An Securities Ltd [2009] HKCFA 48;  (2009) 12 HKCFAR 808, Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off (5thed) at §10-25 (in support of the propositions that where a claim for passing off is made out, a permanent injunction is, in practice,
normally granted as a matter of cause; and if an injunction is granted, it is normal to order delivery up or destruction upon oath
of items the disposal ofwhich would infringe the injunction), and Kabushiki Kaisha Yakult Honsha vYakudo Group Holdings Ltd (No 4)  [2004] HKCFI 156; [2004] 2 HKLRD 587 at §39 (as authority for the proposition that even if the defendant did not start trading under the infringing name, the court will
require the name to be changed).  I have alsoconsidered the pleaded facts in the present case.  The name of the defendant is practically
the same as the Tradename.  The field of business is the same.  In my view, a clear inference can be drawn that that was not the
result of any unhappy coincidence, but that of a deliberate decision to pass off the Tradename.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
that a default judgment in terms of the Summons is justified, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the same on their Statement
of Claim.  I so order.","Date of Decision:

SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE v. YIU CHUNG YIM [2018] HKCFI 2236; HCMP 3378/2016 (4 October 2018),"25.  As I have explained above, by reference to those previous and present rulings of the President, it was reasonably understandable
in those circumstances why Mr Yiu was led to mistakenly believe that, at the least, he should be allowed a second chance to retake
the LegCo Oath under the law.  This is particularly so given Mr Yiu’s relatively “milder” way in inserting the Extra Words
in taking the oath when compared with those previous cases.  It is therefore also not unreasonable why Mr Yiu was led to the mistaken
belief that he could successfully defend these actions by seeking effectively to uphold the President’s Ruling.  In this respect,
it is pertinent to note that the President had the benefit of legal advice in making the rulings, and that the Government had not in the past sought to challenge those previous rulings of the President and the Clerk. 26.  When all these are considered together, given the particular circumstances pertinent to Mr Yiu’s subject conduct, his understandable
mistaken belief that he should be at the least allowed to retake the LegCo Oath, the public interest perspective in these proceedings,
and the fact that the plaintiffs had not in the past sought to challenge the Clerk or the President’s similar previous rulings, I agree
that it would not be fair and just in all the circumstances to require him to bear the costs of these actions. 27.  For the above reasons, I would vary the costs order nisi to no order as to costs.

existence of the Agreement is the mother of the parties who is of an advanced age.  It is, therefore, in the parties’ interests

time and not at the address he had provided to the Immigration Department.  It was only when he went to sign on that he provided
a new address and thereafter the relevant documents were sent to him.  He had no other excuse. 8.  The applicant has now been in Hong Kong since 2009.  He has been interacting with various government agencies for the entirety of
that period and accepts he received all necessary documents and notifications.  He fully understood that they required an up to date
address in order to correspond with him.  The explanation he has offered to this court, whilst frank, was not the same as he suggested
in the letter appended to the summons, which was that he did not understand the procedure.  The reason this application is late is
to be put entirely at his own door.  He was notified promptly of the decision of this court and, had he been living at his registered
address, he would have been made aware of what was required of him should he wish to appeal that decision.  It was incumbent upon
him to do so promptly.  He put himself in a position where that could not happen.  In any event, his underlying application has no
merit as explained in the initial refusal of leave.  It would not be in the interest of justice to grant an extension of time in

in particular, the fact that it was DHCJ Seagroatt who de-linked the Amendment Application from the SDA Application (though, no doubt,
with the best will in the world) and the fact that the Notice to Act should really not have been filed (albeit that there was a subsequent
offer by LKH to withdraw it voluntarily or set it aside by consent), I have decided that justice will be done sufficiently if my
orders for costs are all on a party and party basis. 69.  I understand from the draft Decision of Harris J that the parties have agreed that the question of the applicants’ indemnification
for Leeloong’s costs in HCA570 be adjourned.  No doubt, in due course, the parties will also argue on the question of the indemnification

against D2, D3, D4 and D5 in this action. Although I have dismissed Ps’ such claim in paragraph 265(j) above, that was for the
purpose of finality. I note D2, D3, D4 and D5 were parties to the TCPSSA, and my findings above reflected that Ds’ camp acted reprehensibly
vis-à-vis Ps. In any event, I do not consider there would be significant costs incurred by D2, D3, D4 and D5 in the overall defence against
Ps’ claim which failed. I therefore consider a fair order for costs would be to make no order. 269.  By the order of Master S Kwang dated 28 May 2014, leave was granted for Ds to discontinue their counterclaim against Ps with costs
reserved to be argued before the trial judge. Thus, the issue of reserved costs was in respect of costs of and occasioned the abandoned
counterclaim (“1st Costs Issue”). In light of my findings in favour of Ps in respect of their claim which must impact on the vitality of their mirrored allegations
in the counterclaim, and given that Ds made a deliberate decision to abandon the counterclaim in the course of their security for
costs application which failed, there is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant an order that Ds do pay Ps’
costs of and occasioned by (a) Ds’ application for leave to discontinue the counterclaim against Ps and (b) Ds’ counterclaim,
including all costs reserved, if any, to be taxed if not agreed. 270.  The present action was scheduled for trial on 10 May 2016 to be heard by Au-Yeung J. On the 1st day of trial, Au-Yeung J adjourned the trial, and the present action came before this court for trial on 27 March 2017. At the pre-trial review on 26 February 2016, DHCJ Au-Yeung (as she then was) ordered that costs of such pre-trial review be reserved (“2nd Costs Issue”). Mr Hui fairly accepted it would be difficult for Ds to resist such costs as the costs for that wasted hearing arose out of matters
raised by Ds. I therefore order Ds to pay Ps costs of and occasioned by the pre-trial review on 26 February 2016 to be taxed if not agreed.","(d)

on the first question, I am not satisfied that the 3rd defendant has proved that he had suffered any loss as a result of the Injunction Order.  The reasons are simply the same as mentioned

WONG CHI FUNG v. SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE [2018] HKCFI 2318; HCSA 29/2018 (16 October 2018),"48.  The deputy adjudicator has carried out an objective assessment of the decision making process of the police officer in respect of
whether and, if yes, when and where it was safe and appropriate to free the claimant of the handcuffs, and he was entitled to conclude
that the decision of the police officer survives the objective test in the circumstances of the case.  Once this is established,
whether or not another tribunal may have come to a different conclusion does not afford an arguable ground of appeal. 49.  Leave to appeal is refused.  I make no order as to costs. 50.  I thank Mr Tam, with Mr Lau, for his assistance.","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

The Petitioners also seek a variation to the 2nd to 19th Respondent’s order, which currently requires discovery up to the date of judgment.  In paragraphs 106 and 107 of my judgment I
say this: 7.  The Petitioners argue that the reference to “up to the presentation of the Petition” must have been intended to qualify the
various paragraphs of the summons that I allowed, which seek discovery “to the date of judgment in this Petition”.  On rereading
my reasons, I agree that this was my intention.  It, follows, that in order to ensure that the order reflects my intention that it
should be amended so that in the current draft order the reference to judgment is replaced with “to the date of presentation of
the Petition”. 8.  There is one further matter, which was discussed at the hearing.  I will order that each of the parties files and serves an affirmation
verifying their respective lists of documents, which should comply with RHC O 24, r 5(1) and (2), in compliance with RHC O 25, r

LAU SHAK WAH AND ANOTHER v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES [2018] HKCFI 2397; HCMP 1433/2018 (16 October 2018),"6.  Recently, which is two years later, Mr Chiu (who was one of two directors of the company) has been informed by his former Dubai
agent that Trilogy was once again active and would like to reactivate the agreement with the company.  This agent still has access
to potential investors, so potentially substantial income could be generated for the company if it were revived.  The former liquidator
of the company and Mr Chiu confirm that there is no irregular matter or transaction in relation to the company that requires investigation
nor any misconduct on the part of the applicants or any former officers of the company. 7.  The applicable principles are helpfully summarised in paragraph 6 of the judgment of Her Ladyship Kwan J (as she then was) in Re Outboard Marine Corp Asia Limited [2002] HKCFI 213; [2003] 1 HKLRD 585.  I only need to mention the more significant of the considerations.  As the exercise of the discretionary power is involved, the
burden is on the applicant to make out a sufficient case for a stay that carries conviction. 8.  This is a case where there are sufficient assets to pay all the creditors and expenses of liquidation.  The overriding considerations
are whether the stay is conducive or detrimental to commercial morality and to the interest of the public at large.  I am satisfied
that the company is solvent and has genuine commercial reasons for seeking a stay of the winding up on a permanent basis and it would
be an appropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant.","andTHE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES

Z v. Y [2018] HKCFI 2342; HCMP 1771/2017 (18 October 2018),"27.  The Respondent’s failure to comply with the Rules in appointing her choice of arbitrator, whether by virtue of her own ignorance
or misunderstanding of the Rules, or as a result of the conscious decision of herself or her legal advisers, is no ground to complain
of the Commission’s appointment of the arbitrators in accordance with its powers under the Rules. 28.  By reason of the foregoing matters, I come to the conclusion that recognition of the Award should be refused under section 95 (3)
(b) of the Ordinance, as it would be contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong to enforce the Award, when there are valid grounds
to claim that the Guarantee was to secure the obligations under the HD Contracts and MD Contracts which are tainted by illegality,
but the tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons as to why it accepted the Guarantee to be valid and legally enforceable.  The
tribunal’s failure to explain adequately why it upheld the validity of the Guarantee also casts doubts on its acceptance of the
existence of a valid and binding arbitration agreement between the Applicant and the Respondent. 29.  The costs of and incidental to the application to set aside the Order granting leave to enforce the Award in Hong Kong should be
paid by the Applicant to the Respondent, with certificate for 2 Counsel.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2342.html,"

CHAU PUI NGAI v. CHAU YAU ZING AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2368; HCA 298/2017 (18 October 2018),"5.  As regards the fixing of time for compliance with the Order, in view of the fact that the Order has been made for over a year and
that D2 has so far shown no signs of compliance, I agree that a time-limit should now be imposed pursuant to Order 45 Rule 6, RHC.
 In my assessment, a 28-day time limit commencing from the date that the substituted service is effected would be a reasonable period
for D2 to comply with the Order.  6.  In the circumstances, I grant an order for substituted service in terms of the summons and that the personal service of the Order
and the Judgment dated 26 September 2017 be dispensed with.  I also impose a 28-day time period for D2 to comply with the Order as
aforesaid. 7.  I also order that the plaintiff shall have the costs of this summons and this application.  The plaintiff’s own costs are to be
taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid’s regulations.","CHAU PUI FUNG

failed to establish that interfering with the current management of the 2 companies “is absolutely essential”.  The Plaintiff
has also failed to establish that granting the Interim Relief sought “appears to carry a lower risk of injustice if [the court]

Chan J on 10 June 2016, is discharged. 83.  As for costs, the plaintiff is to pay the costs of the action against the 2nddefendant, including all reserved costs, to be taxed if not agreed.  As between the plaintiff and the 1stdefendant, I take into account the fact that the plaintiff only recovers nominal damages from the 1stdefendant, and the action in nuisance is dismissed.  An undertaking has been provided by the 1stdefendant on 18 September 2017 which would have served the plaintiff’s purposes.  In my judgment, the appropriate costs order between
the plaintiff and the 1stdefendant is that the 1stdefendant is to pay the costs of the action of the plaintiff up to and including 18 September 2017, including all reserved costs,
to be taxed if not agreed, and the plaintiff is to pay the costs of the action of the 1st defendant thereafter, including all reserved costs, to be taxed if not agreed.  The 1stdefendant is to pay the costs of the counterclaim to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed. 84.  The costs orders made at the preceding paragraph are on a provisional basis.

HKSAR v. KHAN ASIF ALI [2018] HKCFI 2359; HCCC 236/2017 (19 October 2018),"97.  Most inconceivable is the defendant’s allegation that despite him telling Mr Donald that he did not know there were drugs in the
packets, Mr Donald boldly and unethically in the presence of his instructing solicitor Mr Mohnani completely disregarded the defendant’s
instructions.  Furthermore that Mr Donald in his letter to the defendant of 25 October 2017[13] would confirm his indifference in writing to tell the defendant to not only tell the truth in his NPS but to state he was aware he
was trafficking in drugs but did not know what the actual drugs were.  98.  The defendant’s allegations against his two teams of legal representatives are wholly unfounded and implausible.  I am satisfied
that on all the evidence before me, the defendant’s plea of guilty was a deliberate, voluntary and a conscious considered decision.
 He was properly advised on the issue of knowledge and no pressure was applied on him to plead guilty. 99.  The defendant’s application to reverse his plea of guilty to not guilty is refused. ",(D’ Almada Remedios)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2359.html,"

applicationfor specific discovery in the present case) that their computer time recording system is not reliable, and was not relied on as an exhaustive record of time spent.  Where the reliability of the Further Bills is itself called
into serious question, the possibility of that consideration constituting “special circumstances” as would warrant the grant
of leave for taxation cannot be excluded. 53.  The prejudice point is not fanciful.  It reinforces the conclusion that the technical defences belatedly raised should not be allowed

RE SWARANJIT KAUR [2018] HKCFI 2183; HCAL 488/2017 (29 October 2018),"4.  The applicant is an Indian national who came to Hong Kong in April 2013 as a visitor and since overstayed, and the basis of her
non-‌refoulement claim was that upon return to India she would be harmed or killed by her father’s creditor for refusing to marry
his son in exchange for the discharge of her father’s debt.  5.  As set out in my judgment, her claim was rejected by the Director of Immigration on the basis, inter alia,  that the risk of harm to her was a localized one and that it was not unreasonable or unsafe for her to relocate to other part of
India and hence there was no justification to afford her with non-refoulement protection, while in her subsequent appeal the Board
upon hearing her in evidence went further to conclude that her evidence relating to her father’s debt, the proposal for marrying
her to his creditor’s son and the threats made by his creditor to her in connection with the debt were not credible, and found
that she had failed to establish a genuine or substantial risk of being subjected to harm, or a real risk to her life or risk of
torture or persecution. 6.  In her application now before me the applicant is merely repeating her claim as before without putting forward any ground with any
prospect of success in her intended appeal.  Her application is totally without merit, and accordingly I refuse her application for
leave to appeal.",Date of Decision: 29 October 2018(Bruno Chan),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2183.html,"

RE SULAKHAN SINGH [2018] HKCFI 2380; HCAL 897/2017 (29 October 2018),"3.  In his summons the applicant stated that he was not aware of my decision of 20 July 2018 until he went to the Immigration Department
to inquire about the progress of his case that he was informed of the decision when by then it was already beyond the 14-day period,
but in his supporting affirmation of the same date he also deposed that he did receive the letter from the High Court informing him
of my order and decision of 20 July 2018. 4.  Be that as it may and while the two weeks’ delay may not appear to me excessive, the phrase “may only be made” in Order 59,
rule 2B(1) is unequivocal, indicating that the application to the Court below may only be made within the stipulated 14-day period,
and that in the absence of express provision giving the court below power to grant extension of time to apply for leave to appeal,
it must necessarily follow that I do not have such power to do so : see Menno Leendert Vos v Global Fair Industrial Ltd & Ors (unreported) HCA 4200/1995, 23 April 2010, para 6).   5.

any errors in my decision.  In the premises and with no power to extend time, I accordingly dismiss his application.","Date of Decision:

more than six months of delay, or any good reason to extend time for such excessive delay, or any merits in his intended challenge,
and accordingly dismissed his application. 2.  The applicant now by a summons issued on 26 September 2018 applies for leave under Order 59, rule 2B of the Rules of the High Court,

which I can only surmise to mean as follows: 3.  These are however just broad and vague assertions of the applicant without any particulars or specifics or relevant elaboration
as to how I erred or failed to apply high standard of fairness in refusing to extend time for his late application, or how I failed
to find that the Board had erred as asserted.  In the premises I am not satisfied that there is any prospect of success in the applicant’s

NG SHING CHIT v. LEE KIN CHU BY HER GUARDIAN AD LITEM GO MAN YIN [2018] HKCFI 2395; HCA 1228/2015 (29 October 2018),"40.  I do not accept Mr Ng’s evidence that Madam Lee ever represented to him that (i) if he would repay the loans, or continue to repay
the loans after Chi Chiu stopped making repayment, she would give him the Property after her death, or (ii) whoever (meaning or including
Mr Ng) repaid the loans would be entitled to the Property after her death.  I also find that Mr Ng has failed to prove the case against
Madam Lee as advanced by him in the Statement of Claim. 41.  Before I end this judgment, I would add the following observation.  This is a case where the Property has been transferred to Madam
Ng’s sole name for nearly 30 years.  If Mr Ng’s claim in respect of the Property is true, he has been sitting on his rights for
many years.  He fully repaid the loans to Liu Chong Hing Bank Limited no later than early 2006. He did not, however, commence this
action until June 2015 when, on his own account, Madam Lee has been disregarding his rights since about mid-2006.  In the meantime,
Madam Lee has become mentally incapacitated, thereby preventing her from giving oral testimony at the trial.  Mr Ng’s delay is
of course not fatal to his case, but it makes the court’s task more difficult in determining the true arrangement or agreement
between the parties which was not fully documented.  In my view, when the court is being asked to find that the registered owner’s
title to a property is subject to some oral trust or arrangement in such circumstances, the court must act cautiously, and should
look for clear and convincing evidence before upholding the alleged trust or arrangement. 42.  For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff’s action against the Defendant is dismissed, with costs to the Defendant (including all
reserved costs) to be taxed if not agreed.  The Defendant’s own costs are to be taxed in accordance with legal aid regulations.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2395.html,"

RE EDWEAD JOHN ALSO KNOWN AS EDWEAD SHAIBU [2018] HKCFI 2390; HCAL 76/2017 (30 October 2018),"9.  Hence it follows, as pointed out by Lam VP in his propositions, that in an appeal the scope for admission of fresh evidence and
for new arguments to be run is limited, and the general rule is that the appellant has to satisfy the requirements in Ladd v Marshall [1954] EWCA Civ 1;  [1954] 1 WLR 1489: see Hounkpedji Messanh v Torture Claims Appeal Board [2018] HKCA 152; Re Romail [2018] HKCA 186; Fayomi v Chief Secretary for Administration [2018] HKCA 194. 10.  As explained in the Board’s decision, the applicant’s claim of risk of harms upon return to Ghana for having been involved in
a hunting group and/or land guards prior to his departure in 2003 was rejected on his credibility, whilst those new COI exhibited
to his affirmation mostly referred to the current situation of the land guards in Ghana and their arrests and prosecutions by the
police for their illegal activities which are not relevant to the applicant’s alleged involvement back in 2003 or earlier, and
would not in my judgment advance his case any further given the findings by the Board, nor would they be accepted by the Court of
Appeal which as noted above would only examine my decision in light of the grounds, if any, advanced bythe applicant, as it is not
their role to examine the decision of the Board afreshas if it is a fresh application for judicial review, otherwise an applicant
could flagrantly disregard, as did the applicant in the present case, the stringent time limit under Order 53, rule 4(1) of the Rules

In the premises and for these reasons I am not satisfied that the applicant has put forward any reasonably arguable ground for his

N v. W [2018] HKCFI 2405; HCCT 39/2018 (30 October 2018),"23.  In any event, the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate before this Court the serious prejudice it sustained as a result of the alleged
misconduct of the arbitrator.  If there was evidence of any actual misuse or wrongful disclosure of the Plaintiff’s confidential
information which had affected the Award, the Court might be more prepared to exercise its discretion in favor of the Plaintiff.
 On the face of the Award, it cannot be seen how the arbitrator’s findings on repudiation could have been affected.  The claims
of the Defendant’s alleged lies and credibility could have been made in the closing submissions to the arbitrator, irrespective
of whether he acceded to the Plaintiff’s request for adjournment. 24.  On the evidence, I reject the claim that the arbitrator had misconducted himself in the arbitral proceedings, or that there is any
defect or error patent on the face of the Award by virtue of his failure to address the existence of the Investigation and the issues
arising from the Investigation. 25.  It follows that the Plaintiff’s application is dismissed, with costs to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on indemnity

The crucial point is that these genuine disputes of fact should be resolved at trial, rather than on affidavit evidence. 30.  In light of the aforesaid, I am of the view that granting unconditional leave to defend to the defendant is the appropriate order
to make. 31.  There is no dispute that the plaintiff is a “foreign plaintiff” as he ordinarily resides in the PRC.  Although the plaintiff
referred to the fact that he has a bank account in Hong Kong, there is also no evidence suggesting that he has any meaningful assets
in this jurisdiction.  The only point taken by the plaintiff in respect of this application is on the merits of his claim but given
the conclusion I have reached in the summary judgment application, an order giving the defendant security is inevitable.  Mr Lau

CHAN MEI LIN AND OTHERS v. LEE HONG [2018] HKCFI 2441; HCA 2861/2001 (31 October 2018),"290.  Mr Li SC submitted that this is an appropriate case for awarding costs on indemnity basis.  P3 pleaded a defective case which is
bound to fail and advanced numerous unmeritorious arguments wasting D’s costs.  By pleading tenancy-in-common in equity without
pleading ouster, P3’s counterclaim is doomed to fail.  This pleading point aside, there was no evidence of ouster.  291.  Both actions are problematic.  The Father with the best of intention bequeathed his beneficial interest in the 2nd Land to the six children with the vision of creating an Eden Garden for all the eleven children, their spouse and their next generation
to use and enjoy as one parcel in common.  As the photographs I reviewed during the trial show, the plaintiffs and D were loving
siblings and loving cousins then.  But circumstances changed thirty years down in time with the Father’s demise.  They were no
longer loving and playful cubs but are now deadly tigers fighting fiercely for their territories and for a piece of meat fallen from
the neighbour’s door.  The Eden Garden has turned into a battlefield and an impasse.  The only way out is for the six children to mutually discharge their obligations under the 2nd 1982 Agreement and swap their lots and, better still, redefining the boundaries and entering into a mutual covenant to provide for
common area for vehicular access.  I pointed out, in particular, the disadvantageous position P3 was in and repeatedly gave judicial
encouragement to the parties for a settlement.  She ought to have discontinued her counterclaim just as D had discontinued his. 
But, my advice fell on death ears.  Being over confident of her chance of success, P3 obstinately pressed on with her counterclaim
which was doomed to fail.  I would not hide my sympathy for her.  A costs order against her is inevitable.  For one consideration,
I am not prepared to order indemnity costs without hearing full argument from both sides, that is, the action was commenced by D
rather unconscionably.  D had the benefit of the use of her land and yet turned around to claim its beneficial interest.  I shall
make a costs order nisi that P3 shall pay D’s costs on a party and party basis and leave it to D to consider if he would wish to engage in full argument
on costs than to make an indemnity costs order nisi and to give P3 the burden of resisting the order. 292.  Because of the unity of possession P3 is not entitled to demand D as a co-tenant to deliver vacant possession of Lot 809 to her
or to demand rent or mesne profits.  Furthermore, having regard to the investment incurred by D as result of the three understandings,
it would be unconscionable to allow P3 to withdraw her consent and to demand delivery of vacant possession of Lot 809 from D.  Accordingly,
P3’s counterclaim is dismissed with a costs order nisi that she shall pay D’s costs of her counterclaim on party and party basis.","1 January 2015 - 31 October 2018

I find no flaws in the magistrate’s reasoning or findings.  In relation to PW3’s evidence,I do not find any of his behaviour
as shown in the CCTV footage remotely indicative of the “planting” allegation made by the appellant.  It is my finding that PW3
did not unwrap anything when he bent down at the metalrailings and that his waving gesture had no significance.  Most importantly,
what he picked up at the metal railing was the cell phone dropped by the appellant and nothing else.  As a juror, the magistrate
is entitled to accept PW2’s evidence that he found Exhibits A and B in the appellant’s right trouser pocket. 19.  Based on the reasons stated above, I see no reason to interferewith the magistrate’s decision.  The appellant’s conviction is
neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory. 20.  The appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

Mr Lai submitted: 43.  In respect of the contention in paragraph 42(a) above, I reiterate paragraphs 29(b) and 31 above. As for Mr Lai’s submissions
in paragraph 42(b)-(c) above, they echoed the criticisms in the Draft Notice set out in paragraph 40 above that this court had acted
in a “non-partisan manner” and failed to exercise “neutral, fair and judicious discretion”. But in the absence of allegation
of actual bias on the part of this court, the manner of formulation of such grounds/submissions was not easy to understand. It is
inappropriate for this court to make an unseemly spectacle of entering into debate over such allegations (despite the seriousness
of the criticism of breach of judicial conduct) save to adopt the observations by the Court of Appeal in Win Glories Limited v Majorluck Limited[20] and Yap Sui Kong v Yip Fong Tim (sued as personal representative of the Estate of Ip Tseung Hong alias Chiu Loi, deceased)[21] on the court’s expectation of a professional approach worthy of counsel in drafting court documents and submissions. 44.

HKSAR v. WONG SAN WING [2018] HKCFI 2301; HCMA 39/2018 (12 November 2018),"40.  There was no need for the magistrate to draw any inferences in this case save for the obvious one of whether there was a meeting
of minds.  He, and I, reject the evidence of D1 and D2 and accept the evidence of PW1.  D1 knew exactly what she was doing and went
to the lengths of providing a town gas bill for a property she did not live in.  D2 also knew the ruse, because he lied to PW1 and
he did so, at the outset, during the interview in the restaurant and maintained the illusion thereafter.  There were a number of
proven facts which overwhelmingly suggest that D1 and D2 both intended to defraud the Department and that they did so in a joint
scheme for which D2 was paid and D3 gained an employee. 41.  As to the suggestion that the magistrate acquitted D3 and therefore this court should infer that there could not have been a meeting
of minds as between D1 and D3, this court’s understanding of his reasoning differs from that of the appellant.  The court’s understanding
of his reasoning is that, although she was substantially implicated, the magistrate was not sure beyond reasonable doubt that she
really understood the system.  In order to find a conspiracy to carry out a substantive offence, the magistrate had to be sure that,
at the moment of the agreement, D3 knew what the substantive offence was and intended to commit that substantive offence.  It was
not a conspiracy to employ a FDH but a conspiracy to submit false documentation to the ID.  Whilst the magistrate did not find that
part was made out beyond reasonable doubt because of her background, he nevertheless believed her to be complicit in an agreement
to employ a FDH.  By contrast, D1 was a business woman and would have known the process and D2 was in the business of seeking employment
visas for FDHs.  Neither were ignorant of the system and on D1’s own admission, she purported to be the employer knowing full well
she was not. 42.  Accordingly, this appeal against conviction is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.","Date of Judgment:

the parties to the 1974 action, Choi actually assigned to the defendant in the present case the two lots of land.  I have considered
the circumstances and I have no doubt that had the parties or the court then come to know about the existence of such conveyance,
the defendant in the present case would have been joined in that action so that that conveyance could be disposed of, and then the
defendant could also be heard. 3.  Now, the opportunity for the defendant to be heard has been made available in the present case.  Although the evidence suggests
that the defendant could not be located, there was the order for substituted service of these proceedings on the defendant.  No appearance
has been entered. The evidence also suggests that apparently the defendant was the daughter of Choi and Lam, and that actually added
to the suspicion about the purported conveyance by Choi and Lam to the defendant back in 1974 just days after the commencement of
that action.   4.  There is nothing to contradict the evidence that the plaintiff in the present case has been in exclusive possession of the two lots
of land since 1976, and in these circumstances, I see no reason why the order sought should not be granted.  In the circumstances,
I would also grant, first of all, the order stated in paragraph 3 [1] of the originating summons as well as paragraph 1 [2] of the originating summons, and following that, an order stated in paragraph 2 [3] of the originating summons.

a juror, the magistrate has accepted PW1’s evidence.  She has found as a fact that the defendant was inserting a metal pole into
a hole on the ground at the subject hawker stall.  She then concluded that no reasonable person who was unconnected to the subject
hawker stall would have done such work. I agree with the magistrate. 14.

NG FUK SHING v. NG FUK NAM AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2528; HCA 611/2015 (16 November 2018),"80.  The above analysis clearly showed there would not be any crisp answer to the 2nd Question that would obviate the need for a full trial, and there would still be significant disputes that would have to be disposed
of at trial even after answering the 1st/2nd Questions, which questions I am afraid were not pure legal matters. I am not persuaded that a trial of preliminary issues as proposed
by Ds would be necessary or appropriate. 81.  For all of the above reasons, the Summons is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant
a costs order nisi that Ds should pay P costs of and occasioned by the Summons (with all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed with certificate
for two counsel. 82.  I take this opportunity to urge the parties to carefully consider whether the Government should be joined in the present action,
so that (a) any cause of action or defence that required their presence could be perfected, (b) any order made would also be binding
on the Government, (c) there could be finality in resolving all relevant disputed issues, and (d) the Government’s stance as to
the proposal on “surrender and re-grant”, encroachment presumption and/or adverse possession could be properly elicited, and
the parties’ respective case properly determined in light of the same. It is pertinent at this stage to take note of Mr Khaw SC’s
submissions in paragraph 68 and footnote 37 above. Given the interlocutory nature of the Summons, it was sufficient for this court
to highlight certain aspects of perceived concerns if the Government was not involved such that there would not be procedural benefit/savings
in proceeding with a trial of preliminary issues, and it was unnecessary for this court to come to any definitive view at this stage
as to whether or not the Government ought to be brought into the present action. But this consideration should exercise not just
the parties but also the court case manager as the present action moves inexorably on towards trial.","(d)

RE LAU YU ALSO KNOWN AS JAFFE LAU [2018] HKCFI 2542; HCB 104/2017 (16 November 2018),"22.  On reading the Decision, I cannot agree that the Deputy Judge had misapplied the law, or had failed to take into consideration relevant
factors, or had considered irrelevant matters, in exercising his discretion to accept the limited cross-undertaking as to damages,
and fixing this in the sum of HK$40 million.  There are no reasonable prospects of success that the Court of Appeal would disturb
the judge’s decision and his assessment of the appropriate amount for the cross-undertaking. 23.  Since I consider that there is no reasonable prospect of success for the appeal against the grant of the Injunctions, the same applies
to the proposed appeal against the disclosure order.  Nor am I satisfied that there are reasonable prospects of success for the intended
appeal against the costs order, when costs are discretionary and there are reasonable grounds for ordering that the costs should
be in the cause in this case. 24.  For all the above reasons, the application for leave to appeal has no reasonable prospects of success in my view, and ought to be
dismissed, with costs.","ALL POWERFUL INVESTMENT LIMITED

that is that the Petitioner came into the shoes of the original petitioner by way of substitution as explained by Mr Chiu. However,
it is quite clear from the Amended Petition that it is premised on the failure of the Company to meet its obligations under the Settlement
Agreement despite various demand letters. 7.  In any case, even if the court is to assume that the Company is solvent, I fail to see why the Company can persist in not paying
its creditors. I should add that this kind of behaviour constitutes a danger to the other traders who may deal with the Company without
knowledge of the habitual non-payment of debts on its part. 8.  For these reasons, subject to the above undertaking by the Petitioner, I grant the relief sought in prayers (i) and (iii) of the

RE HOSSAIN MD SUMON [2018] HKCFI 2424; HCAL 551/2017 (20 November 2018),"4.  In the applicant’s case a delay of more than one and a half month cannot be said to be insignificant.  In his supporting affirmation
of the same date he explained that he was not aware of the rule regarding the 14-day period for lodging of appeal, and at the hearing
of his summons before me he further asserted that he did not receive the decision as he was then being detained by the Immigration
Department, but when it was revealed that it was only on 19 June 2018 when he was detained while the decision was sent to his last
known reported address almost two weeks earlier on 7 June 2018, he was unable to explain why he did not receive the decision.  In
the circumstances I am not satisfied that he has provided any valid or acceptable explanation for his delay. 5.  More importantly, he did not provide any draft or proposed ground for his appeal, or any particulars as to any error in the decision
or whyit was unreasonable or unfair notwithstanding his assertion in his affirmation that he has a good ground of appeal.  In the
absence of any reasonably arguable ground I am unable to see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

of the same date he explained that he did not receive the decision from the Court until 2 October 2018 when he printed it out from
the internet, and at the hearing of his summons before me he further clarified that he only learnt about the Court’s decision on
22 September 2018 when he attended at the Immigration Department to report on his recognizance, but as he all along resided at the
same address at all material time to which the decision was posted by the Court on the same date, he was unable to explain why he
never received it at his address.  In the circumstances I am not convinced that he has provided any acceptable reason for his delay. 5.  More significantly, he did not provide any draft or proposed ground for his appeal, or any particulars as to any error in the decision
or why it was unreasonable or unfair, without which I am unable to see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

minors had reached full age of 26 and 30 respectively.  Then on 4 November 1975, Mr. Wan Yau-po, by a deed of gift, assigned all
his interest in Lot Nos 526 and 527 to Mr. Wan Man. Subsequently, by an assignment dated 25 August 2011, Wan Man, in consideration
of HK$300,000, sold the properties, namely Lot Nos 526 and 527, to Wan Yau-loi (温有來), Wan Loi-hei (温來喜), Wan Kam-hung

Ms Chit for the respondent has fairly drawn my attention to the issue of deduction for administrative detention[4].  The appellant was under administrative detention for a period of 36 days in early 2014 when he illegally entered Hong Kong.  In
other words, the administrative detention took place 4 years prior to the present offence. Furthermore, thedetention was unrelated
to the present offence.  As such, it does not trigger the operation of section 67A(1A) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221)[5].  The issue of administrative detention was not raised by the appellant's trial counsel during mitigation either.  I simply see no
reason why I should exercise my discretion to reduce the appellant's sentence for the administrative detention. 16.  This appeal has no merits and must be dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

The outcome of the trial plainly justified the application for the interim Mareva injunction. Costs of the Mareva injunction should follow the cause.  The Mareva injunction was ordered before the sanctioned offer was made and so costs should be on party and party basis. 26.  I ordered that costs of both summonses be to the plaintiff to be taxed on indemnity basis, at the enhanced interest rate until full

not find them to be directly relevant to exercise of my discretion whether or not to grant leave to amend.  Even if marginally relevant,
they have not impacted on the exercise of my discretion in this matter.  However, insofar as they may affect the merits of the substantive

of complexity as would warrant instructing counsel to pursue or to resist the application.  However, this is an exceptional case.

their improper conduct, the respondents can be deprived of their costs of the proceedings before the Magistrate.  24.  However, insofar as the appeal is concerned, the respondents being the successful parties should normally have their costs unless
there is special reason not to follow the usual rule.  While counsel for the respondents rendered little assistance in the issue
raised by the court, it cannot be said that the respondents or their legal representatives misconducted themselves in the appeal
such that the respondents should be penalized by costs.  Indeed, the appeal would have been dismissed even if the issue raised by
this court had not been raised.  In my judgment, it is only fair that the normal rule should apply and the respondents, as the successful
parties, should not be deprived of the costs for the appeal. 25.  The respondents are to have full costs of the appeal, to be taxedif not agreed.  R1’s application for costs of the trial, and

no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim against her as a partner of the Firm, on the basis of the 1st Facility Letter signed by the 1st Defendant - Wong’s partner at the material time of the loan.  It is not disputed by Wong that she signed the account opening form
with the Plaintiff, purporting to be a partner of the Firm, and that she was held out to the Plaintiff, and to the world at large,
as a partner of the Firm.  The 1st Defendant, as partner, would have the usual authority to sign documents on her behalf for the Firm.  Wong’s assertion that as a
non-equity partner, it was understood and agreed between the 1st Defendant and herself that she would not be liable for the debts and liabilities of the Firm, as she was not responsible for the
profits and losses of the Firm, is no answer to the claim made by the Plaintiff, a third-party dealing with the Firm and to whom
Wong was held out (with her consent) to be a partner.  At most, Wong would be entitled to seek indemnity from the 1st Defendant.  23.  The Statement of Claim pleads (paragraph 1 (b)) that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were trading as the Firm. It makes it clear that the loans were made to, received and utilised by the Firm pursuant to
the Facility Letters.  Wong disputes her signatures on the documents relied upon by the Plaintiff in her evidence filed in support
of her application to set aside the Judgment, but if, after considering the merits of the Plaintiff’s case, Wong has no real defence
to the claims made against her as a partner for the debts of the Firm, there is no point to the setting aside, and no injustice in
the exercise of the discretion of the Court, not to set aside the regular judgment.  24.  For these reasons, the appeal against the Master’s refusal to set aside the Judgment is dismissed, with costs to the Plaintiff,

the applicant from appealing against the decision and declining to set aside the statutory demand.  7.  The grounds of appeal do challenge the way in which the learned judge applied the legal principles in deciding whether there was

above, that the defendant has “sat on its hands” for an unduly long period of time.  That has undoubtedly been a factor underpinning the instigation of the litigation. 47.  In the circumstances therefore it seems to me that the appropriate order to make is that there be no order as to costs.  This is
the order I make, on an “order nisi” basis.","LIU TONG, LIU WAI KEUNG and

leave in order that the Court of Appeal has the opportunity to review the decision generally.  It seems to me almost necessarily
that the Court of Appeal is likely to have to take some kind of view in respect of my decision in the plaintiffs’ favour when considering
the plaintiffs’ notice of appeal, and it would be artificial and restrictive not to allow the Court of Appeal the opportunity,
if it thought it appropriate, to interfere with my decision in the plaintiffs’ favour. 4.  I will, therefore, grant leave to appeal, and order that the costs of this application be in the cause of the appeal.  5.

RE ALAM MAHIR [2018] HKCFI 2420; HCAL 125/2017 (29 November 2018),"4.  In the applicant’s case a delay of more than one year must be regarded as very substantial or excessive.  In his supporting affirmation
of the same date he explained that he did not receive any letter from the Court and hence was not aware of the decision until he
was detained by the Immigration Department when he was told of the decision and was thereforeunable to lodge his appeal until now,
but at the hearing of his summons before me he clarified that as he was not aware of the rule and that his friends did not give him
proper advice which accounted for the delay.  Given these seemingly contradictory explanations, and that he was unable to explain
why the decision did not reach him at his last known reported address at the material time, I do not accept that he has provided
any valid explanation for such considerable delay. 5.  To decide whether there is good reason to extend time it would be relevant to consider the prospect of his intended appeal by referring
to his proposed grounds of appeal, of which he however did not provide any despite his claim in his affirmation that he has good
grounds,and in the absence of any particulars as to any error in the decision or why it was unreasonable or unfair, I am unable to
see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application
for leave to appeal out of time, and dismiss his summons.","RE:

explanation in his supporting affirmation of the same date, and only at the hearing of his summons before me did he simply claim
to have not received the decision from the Court without providing any further particulars, but as the record shows that the decision
with a covering letter was posted by the Court on thesame date to his reported address which he confirmed at the hearing as correct,
I am not satisfied that he has given any valid explanation for his delay. 5.  More importantly, he did not provide any draft or proposed ground for his appeal either, or any particulars as to any error in the
decision or why he considered it unfair or unreasonable, without which I am unable to see any prospect of success in his intended

CHAMPION FOREVER GROUP LTD v. ADDCHANCE DYEING FACTORY LTD [2018] HKCFI 2512; HCMP 2556/2017 (29 November 2018),"114.  I am not prepared to make an order for a speedy trial in the current circumstances.  It seems to me to be unfair for the reasons
Mr Man has advanced and it will clearly have an adverse effect on the overall administration of the courts and impact those other
parties waiting for their cases to be listed. 115.  I am not convinced that anything said on behalf of CFGL outweighs the advantages of the trial judge being able to hear the entire
story relating to these proceedings in a coherent manner against the background of a consolidated set of pleadings.  It is clear
from what has been said that the proceedings are not at an advanced stage since there are further interlocutory applications in relation
to discovery which are to be made and on any stretch of the imagination pleadings will have to be amended.  In those circumstances
the interests of justice militate in my view in favour of the conversion of the HCMP action to a writ action and the consolidation
of the two sets of proceedings so that they can be heard together with the current HCA action being the lead action.  In view of
Mr Shieh’s concern that there should be no delay I am prepared to direct a reasonably aggressivetimetable for further directions
as follows in accordance with the directions proposed by Mr Man: 116.  In all of the circumstances I make a cost order nisi in favour of the defendants with a certificate for two counsel in HCMP 2556/2017, to be taxed if not agreed.  In relation to the

of the timing of their launch but I accept the plaintiff’s need to have carried out some further investigations into the parties’
respective roles before it couldlaunch proceedings and in these circumstances I do not think the delay here is disproportionately
long such that it should be the predominant factor in reaching my decision. 87.  Accordingly I have concluded that there is a serious issue to be tried and that whilst damages might be an adequate remedy in relation
to the alleged claim in relation to the Hung Hing Project, which is now complete, that is not the case in relation to any existing
or future breaches of confidentiality by the defendants.  Accordingly I think that the balance of convenience favours the grant of
the restraining injunction to the extent I have indicated but not the springboard injunction. 88.  In all of the circumstances I make an order nisi that the costs be in the cause. ","D3

Finally in relation to P’s case that Xu had apparent authority I accept the finding of the Court of Final Appeal in Akai Holdings Ltd (No 2) that it is practically inconceivable to see how an agent without actual authority could cloth himself with apparent authority
by his own representation.  The fact of Xu’s appointment as co-Chairman and Executive Director of D, confer no actual authority
(whether express or implied) on Xu to enter into the agreement for the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement because of their peculiar
and unusual nature.  For the same reason such appointment (without more) cannot be a representation of Xu’s apparent authority
for agreeing to the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement in the circumstances of this case. 56.  The Court of Final Appeal in Akai Holdings Ltd (No 2) further held that any reliance on the apparent authority of an agent could not be “dishonest or unnatural (which includes turning
a blind eye and being reckless)”.  The peculiarity of the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement strongly demonstrate that P’s
purported reliance on the apparent authority of Xu was at least irrational or reckless for the following reasons: 57.

SIU CHI TAT ALSO KNOWN AS CHI TAT SIU v. LAND ZONE LTD [2018] HKCFI 2582; HCA 1670/2018 (30 November 2018),"30.  In the circumstances I have concluded that an injunction is theappropriate way forward.  The risk of detriment or inconvenience
to P is sogreat that it seems to me just that the court should act to protect P’s positionpending trial.  The injunction sought
is of very limited application.  P hasconfirmed that it is prepared to erect a padlocked gate with fencing blocking any access to
D’s lot through the proposed opening if D requests this. 31.  I am conscious too in exercising my discretion in this way that throughout the period of the dispute and for many years before that
D’s lot has been deserted and in particular nothing has been stored or placed on the disputed land.  As a result it seems to me
that the injustice which will be caused to P if the injunction were to be refused far outweighs any inconvenience which would be
caused to D if the injunction is granted.  Whilst the delay in seeking the court’s assistance is a factor to be taken intoaccount,
I do not think that it should be the predominant factor in deciding whether or not it is just and fair to grant the injunction. 32.  I would only add that it is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an accommodation pending trial to avoid the
time and costs expended so far.  In the circumstances I make an order nisi for D’s costs in the cause.","LAND ZONE LIMITED (立崇有限公司)

applicationand I therefore summarily assessed the costs to be paid by the defendant on an indemnity basis. 10.  In ordering indemnity costs I took note of the defendant’s approach to his security for costs application, his disregard for the
Court in not even appearing on this application and the without prejudice correspondence put before the court after I had made the
order I have, which demonstrates to my mind a clear attempt on the defendant’s part to extract a punitive sum from the plaintiff
by way of compensation for his withdrawing his trademark which is the subject of the action; this seems to me to be evidence of a
base ulterior motive. 11.  If a party is sued and states an intention to defend it is disrespectful to the court simply to abandon any attempt to participate

1018/2017 shortly afterwards (para 2 above), shows that the Kam Tin address was an effective means of communication. 26.  For the above reasons, the applicant’s explanation for his absence at the earlier court hearing is rejected as being not credible.
 Thus, no valid reason has been provided for his absence. 27.  By reason of the above matters, this application for leave to appeal (out of time) against the dismissal order is refused.","DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION

WONG CHAK MING v. WONG YUEN WAN ALICE AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 77; HCMP 3395/2016 (10 December 2018),"30.  I, therefore, order P to pay costs of the 1st summons of D1 to D1 and D2’s summons to D2. 31.  Regarding D1’s 2nd summons, I think it is an abuse of process because I can see no purpose but mud throwing by saying that P was
not attending to what used to be something that he was very concerned and cared about.  This has nothing to do with the administration
of the estate and I order D1 to pay P indemnity costs on this summons. 32.  Regarding D1’s 3rd summons, part of it is consented to.  So I do not think P should pay costs for that part.  The other part was
opposed successfully and has been dismissed. So, I would order half of the costs of D1’s 3rd summons be in the cause and the remaining
half be paid by D1 to P on party and party basis.  I do not think that is an abuse, although irrelevant.  I, therefore, do not regard
the indemnity scale as appropriate.","WONG SAU LIN ESTELLA (黃秀蓮)

D asked for the costs of the Summons forthwith on the ground that (in D’s view) the Summons should never have been taken out.  I gave this option serious thought but decided against it.  In my view, bearing in
mind the presumption of consideration in law in relation to cheques, it was not wholly unreasonable for P to attempt summary judgment application in the manner as it did, even though I decided against P in the
end.  All things considered, I came to the view that the most appropriate costs order would be costs in the cause of the action and
I so order. 21.  On the question of Certificate for Counsel, in my judgment it was reasonable, necessary and proper for both P and D to engage Counsel
to argue the Summons substantively, as the presentation of the evidence in this matter and the submissions on the law both called
for the engagement of skillful advocates.  I granted Certificate for Counsel for the Summons accordingly. 22.  I thank both Counsel for their most able assistance.","Date of Decision:

Officer only considered that aspect of the case briefly in one paragraph at §50.  She has not elaborated on her detailed consideration.

which was all but one small aspect of her overall consideration, might affect the conclusion that she ultimately reached. 24.  Once the above is disposed of, what are left with the Grounds are a barrage of what are in my view challenges of a factual nature
disguised as alleged failure on the Presiding Officer’s part to carry out her duty to investigate.  They concerned factual matters
like the commission-based arrangement between the applicant and the defendant, the defendant’sexplanation on the way certain Employer’s
Returns were filed with the InlandRevenue Department, the applicant’s attitude to superiors, her choice to turn down new cases,

be in the interest of justice to grant an extension of time in all the circumstances of this case. 9.  The applicant’s summons dated 4 September 2018 be dismissed.","Date of Ruling:

HERAEUS LTD v. CHAN YUN MUI AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2721; HCA 878/2011 (17 December 2018),"123.  On the other hand, P’s concerns were real.[69] If the D2 and Amend Summonses as were acceded to now (ie 7 years after commencement of the present action), the parties would have
to return to basics to re-draw their pleadings and engage in interlocutory skirmishes (including further discovery and supplemental/further
witness statements on the business model / Practice and their actual operation as between SKL and P doing back decades, or even expert
accounting evidence[70]) before the present action could be set down for trial. Mr Fong seemed to have assumed P’s affirmation evidence filed for opposing
the D2 Summons would be the sum total of P’s resistance to the Violet Amendments (if allowed). I see no basis for such assumption
when P already alluded to the investigations that would be required. The fact P saw no need to condescend into a debate over the
business model / Practice for the purpose of resisting the D2 Summons would not preclude P from pleading its full array of reply
contentions if the Violet Amendments were allowed. Further, it must not be forgotten that D2 himself was still seeking discovery
from HSBC to fortify the averments in the Violet Amendments. In my view, the delay that was likely to arise would be considerable,
and could take up to a year if not longer (see also paragraphs 112-113 above). This was particularly worrying since (a) the parties
had been at the brink of trial being set down since December 2016, and (b) D2 had been assuring the court even earlier, ie since
2015, that his case was ready for trial. Although there was no trial date as yet, it was clear but for the D2 Summons/Appeal this
action could have been set down for trial upon completion of the D1 Appeal. In the circumstances, although no milestone date was
disturbed, “[in] substance and in effect, it is little different from disturbing a milestone date”.[71] It was plain that if relief was granted in favour of D2, P was bound to suffer procedural/forensic prejudice which could not be compensated
by costs or interest on the judgment debt even if P were to succeed at trial. I bear in mind that the Kupka Aff referred to P’s
non-retention of business documents after a period of 7 years. 124.  For all of the above reasons, the D2 Appeal must be dismissed. There be liberty for P to set the present action down for trial as
per the order of the Registrar dated 9 December 2016. I further direct that within 7 days from today P shall apply to the Listing Clerk
to restore its summons filed on 23 February 2018 for 3-minute hearing before master. But I hope both parties should see the sense
of dealing with such summons by consent in order to save time and costs. 125.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P costs of and occasioned by the D2 Appeal to be taxed forthwith on indemnity basis if not agreed.","1456058

MOHAMMED FAHEEM v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 2753; HCAL 707/2017 (17 December 2018),"1.  This is an application dated 8 November 2018 for appeal from my decision of 27 July 2018 refusing leave to apply for judicial review.
In the normal course of events, the applicant had 14 days in which to apply to appeal that decision. He did not do so because the
Order had incorrectly indicated that his application had been allowed, whereas a reading of the Call-1 form would have made it clear
that was not the case. 2.  The error was only corrected on 1 November 2018 and thereafter should have been served upon the applicant. He is rightly aggrieved
at this apparent change of stance as he was entitled to believe that his application would proceed to a substantive review in due
course. Unfortunately, that is not the case. His application was refused and remains so. 3.  In the light of the above, the applicant has 14 days from today to file any application for leave to appeal the decision of this
Court dated 27 July 2018. ","Date of Ruling:

ZHANG YAN YIN v. KORCHINA CULTURE INVESTMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2764; HCA 30/2018 (18 December 2018),"30.  On 10 November 2017, the Court granted injunctions against the Son, Wang and SC (a company controlled by the Family) in HCA 2509
instituted by Gu and Korchina, whereby they were restrained from disposing of their interests and ownership in the assets of AF including
its shareholding in Alishan.  Korchina and Gu have undertaken to give notice to inform Zhang’s solicitors in writing within 48
hours of any change in respect of these injunctions.  There is no risk of further dissipation of or dealings in the shares in AF
or Alishan.  31.  For all the above reasons, I am not satisfied that Zhang has established any irreparable damage to justify the grant of an interim
injunction.  There is inordinate and unjustifiable delay in the application for injunction by the Summons issued in this action,
as set out in the preceding paragraphs of this Decision.  There is no satisfactory explanation as to why this action has to be instituted,
and why the claims made in this action cannot be pursued in the 2014 Action, which remains ongoing as against AF and Alishan.  Nor
is the injunction sought by Zhang in respect of dealings in the shares in AF and Alishan necessary, when court injunctions and cross-undertakings
are in place in HCA 2509, whereby the Family and Wang have been prohibited from dealing with the AF Shares and the Land.  32.  The Summons is accordingly dismissed, with costs to be paid by Zhang to the Defendants, with certificate for Counsel. ","Date of Reasons for Decision:

ACROPOLIS LTD v. THE HONGKONG &AMP; SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2759; HCMP 1031/2018 (19 December 2018),"20.  Furthermore, in my view, there is no particular need for the adjourned hearing to be fixed in consultation with counsel’s diary.
 HKSBC will not contest the application and will abide by any decision of the court.  BOCHK may have some practicality issues to
argue but in principle is neutral.  The plaintiff had all along been represented by senior and junior counsel.  If the plaintiff
is really so mindful about time, he could dispense with the luxury of having the services of senior counsel.  There is no reason
to doubt junior counsel’s competency in an application of this nature. Had the plaintiff adopted this course instead of seeking
to vary the Order, the application would have, by now, been disposed of.  Probably, the practicality issues could be resolved much
more speedily by agreement instead of by argument with senior counsel before the court.  21.  As for the plaintiff’s application to vary the costs order, it mustbe borne in mind that the issue of costs is within the discretion
of the judge who had conduct of the proceeding.  The hearing on 13 July 2018 was essentially a direction hearing and hearing of the
IS.  Since the plaintiff adopted the wrong procedure and the IS served no purpose, there is no reason why if he succeeds in HCCW
218/2017, the respondents in that case should bear these costs.  It is appropriate that he should be deprived of his costs of thehearing
on 13 July 2018.  Mr Smith SC’s mirror argument has no merit.  Anyway, in HCMP 1721/2017, Madam Justice Lisa Wong reserved costs.
 What was lost in that case was not lost forever.  When the occasion comes for argument on costs, the plaintiff may have strong grounds
based on procedural irregularity to resist Zhang’s application for costs.  In any event, what costs order was awarded in another
case has no bearing on the costs order to be made in this case.  What the court has to do is to make a costs order which is proper
and appropriate.  In my view, the costs order made by Madam Justice Lisa Wong is proper and appropriate and one which the Court of
Appeal will not interfere.  I would also have made the same order myself were I in her shoes.  There is no reason to vary the costs
order. 22.  For the above reasons, the plaintiff’s variation summons is dismissed with no order as to costs.  BOCHK filed a skeleton submission.
 As the submission is more related to the discovery issue and has little bearing on the variation application, it would be more appropriate
to reserve the issue of BOCHK’s costs.",Date of Decision: 19 December 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2759.html,"

made in the draft Re-Amended Form 86 in support of those grounds are not reasonably arguable with a realistic prospect of success
if they are considered at the leave stage.  I would therefore formally grant leave to the BA to amend the Amended Form 86 in the
form of the draft Re-Amended Form 86. Costs of the application to re-amend be in the costs of the judicial review. 89.  In light of the above outcome, I believe a fair and just costs order should be that the BA should bear half of the IPs’ costs
in this judicial review.  I therefore make an order nisi that half of the costs of this application be to the IPs to be taxed if not agreed. 90.  I thank counsel for their helpful assistance in this matter.","Date of Judgment:

However, for the 2nd Amendment Summons, I agree with Mr Lam, S.C., for the 1st Respondent that costs of the same should be ordered against the Petitioner on an indemnity basis. First, the taking out of the 2nd Amendment Summons is a breach of this court’s order dated 3 October 2018.

the same information.  It was a misconceived effort.  They likewise covered a period of time in respect of which the plaintiff makes
no claim for any loss of rental income.  In any event, the reasons for which such information was said to be relevant and necessary
did not stand up to scrutiny.  See paragraphs 25, 26 and 28 of the Decision.  As in the case of Interrogatory 4, the plaintiff could
not be blamed for opposing Interrogatory 4 or the Discovery Summons, as they were drafted. 15.  In the circumstances, a fair costs order should reflect the defendants’ defeat for almost all their requests under the interrogatories
and the Discovery Summons. 16.  For these reasons, I order the defendants to pay 90% of the plaintiff’s costs both below and on appeal.  I fail to see any reason
to distinguish between the proceedings below and before me.  As Master Chow had already summarily assessed the plaintiff’s costs
below at HK$95,000, I will vary the costs order she made by ordering the defendants to pay HK$85,500 (i.e. HK$95,000 x 90%) to the
plaintiff for its costs of the Interrogatories Summons and the Discovery Summons before the master.  To facilitate the summary assessment
