LEE SIU FONG v. WONG WAN LEUNG AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 3; HCA 122/2012 (3 January 2017),"133.  There is an issue about the counterclaim for possession by the Government.  According to Mr Mok, if the court were to find that
the Plaintiff is now occupying Lot 307 with the permission of the Government, then the counterclaim is not needed because the Government
by definition is already in possession of Lot 307. 134.  I have dealt with this issue briefly in §70 of this Judgment.   Because the Plaintiff has not pleaded any issue relating to the
validity of the MOT after the death of the Father, the witnesses had not been asked to deal with such issue in their oral testimony.
 However, based on the factors referred to in §§61 to 68 of this Judgment, I can only conclude that, despite the MOT had not been
formally transferred to the Plaintiff, he had been occupying the Land under some sort of implied licence after the death of the Father.
 So far as Lot 307 is concerned, the Government had withdrawn the licence in the end of 2011 when it returned the annual renewal
fee to the Plaintiff.  Hence, the Government is entitled to obtain an order for possession of the occupied parts of Lot 307 against
the Plaintiff.  I therefore grant judgment in favour of the 3rd Defendant on the counterclaim for such order of possession.  The counterclaim by the 2nd Defendant is dismissed. 135.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of the action be to the Defendants which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this
Judgment.","Dates of Trial: 6-8, 12, 18 January 2016Date of Judgment: 3 January 2017","(David Lok)

the submissions today and the lengthy privileged note on the draft consent summons placed before me.  I am satisfied that the terms
agreed upon by the parties are appropriate.  They were arrived at with the assistance of lawyers, past and present, of Mr Yau and
the DLA, upon a proper reflection of responsibility or the lack of it, and a true recognition of not wasting legal aid funds. 5.  In the premises, the court approves the settlement and I grant an order in terms of the consent summons as amended by me, which
terms should remain not open to public search. 6.  I only wish to add that in a case of this nature where a legally-aided litigant is asked to show cause as to why he should not bear
personal costs and a settlement is reached which is not a simple all‑or-nothing liability as to costs, it would be useful for the
litigant or the DLA to produce a short memorandum to explain the rationale behind the settlement terms.","Date of Decision: 6 January 2017(Queeny Au-Yeung)

HKK v. N [2017] HKCFI 1872; HCCT 45/2012 (6 January 2017),"107.  Since the licence granted to the defendant commenced from 1 July 2014 and expired on 30 June 2015, if it should be renewed, the
renewal date should be 1 July 2015.  That was however after “the Expiry Date” of 30 June 2015.  Hence, the plaintiff had no authorization
to grant or renew to the defendant the licence for a year commencing on 1 July 2015 and expiring on 30 June 2016.  I therefore hold
that the defendant is not entitled to a license of back catalogue KMVs up to 30 June 2016. 108.  There is not much factual dispute between the parties in this application.  Unfortunately, the parties have in their affidavits/affirmations
made many hot but irrelevant accusations against each other.  These accusations do not assist the court in resolving the dispute.
 If this should happen again, consideration will be given on what appropriate costs order to make to reflect the waste of time and
resources for making such accusations.   109.  Since the defendant has lost all the issues on the discharge summons and the third party proceedings, I make a costs order nisi that the defendant do pay the plaintiff its costs of the discharge summons and the third party its costs of the third party proceedings

HKSAR v. YIP SAI-KIN [2017] HKCFI 24; HCCC 467/2015 (7 January 2017),"11.  Ms Wong submits on behalf of the defendant that he should be treated as leniently as possible given his relatively young age and
genuine remorse.  She has submitted letters from the defendant’s mother and uncle.  They both described the defendant as a caring
and bright young person who shows a lot of promise, but unfortunately because of his circumstances he had sought to make some easy
money.  The mother explains that the defendant needed money to marry his pregnant girlfriend but who has now left him, having terminated
the pregnancy.  It is clear to me despite the defendant’s denial of being addicted to drugs that he has been tied up in the drug
community and more than likely as a user of drugs who in this instance also sought to trade in them.  The defendant is a tragic figure
and unfortunately one that comes before the courts on a regular basis: a young person who for whatever reason, whether it be a loss
of self respect or a feeling of insecurity, has resorted to the use of or trading in drugs.  The pattern is all too familiar in that
the offences become more frequent and more serious.  12.  As stressed by Ms Wong, the strongest mitigating factor in the defendant’s favour is that he pleaded guilty and sought to cooperate
with the authorities. 13.  The narcotic content of ketamine involved in the present case falls within the band as set out in the tariff case of S of J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1, of 300 to 600 grammes with a corresponding sentence of 9 to 12 years’ imprisonment.  I will adopt a starting point of 10 years’
imprisonment which is slightly less than would otherwise be imposed but I do so because of his relatively young age and potential
to turn a new leaf and live a decent life.  I will discount the starting point by one-third for the defendant’s plea of guilty
to 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment. The defendant is accordingly sentenced to 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Date of Hearing:

RE GW ELECTRONICS CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 98; HCCW 81/2016 (9 January 2017),"4.  The practice of the Companies Court in circumstances of this sort is quite clear.  A strike-out application effectively determines
the substantive issue in the petition.  If the strike-out issue is unsuccessful, a company will normally automatically be wound up,
unless the parties agree or the Court is persuaded that the petition should be adjourned in order to allow the company the opportunity
to settle the petitioner’s, and possibly other creditors’, claim.  If the petition is not going to be adjourned for reasons of
this sort, the company is wound up, and it is not the practice of the Companies Court to grant a stay pending an appeal of either
a decision to dismiss a strike-out application, or if the matter is determined at the trial of the petition, to challenge the Companies
Court’s judgment. 5.  What, in effect, the Company is seeking is the opportunity to file further evidence which would demonstrate that Anthony Chan J’s
decision was wrong.  This I am not prepared to do and would clearly be wrong in principle.  6.  As a final fall-back position, Mr Yip sought an adjournment of one week in order to give his clients the opportunity to consider whether they should pay so much of the debt as is possible.  The Petitioner
is not prepared to agree to an adjournment in order to allow the Company the opportunity to try and settle a claim which has been
outstanding for some considerable period of time, I will therefore make the normal winding-up order.",Date of Hearing: 9 January 2017Date of Decision: 9 January 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

"WENG, CHI CHEONG v. BARCLAYS CAPITAL ASIA LTD [2017] HKCFI 23; HCA 741/2016 (10 January 2017)","15.  Fifthly, as regards Items D1-3, whilst I accept time would be required to prepare skeleton submissions, peruse the Notice of Appeal,
and prepare/peruse correspondence with client, P and court, I find it unnecessary for “P” to be involved. Given the history of
the Master Hearing, I am persuaded such tasks could be attended to by the junior fee-earner JF with supervision by the partner Mr
Thomas. As alluded to above, I consider it reasonable and appropriate for Mr Thomas to appear at the Appeal Hearing with the assistance
of JF (but not 3 professional fee-earners). On party-and-party basis, it was also unnecessary for “P” to be involved in the preparation
for the Appeal Hearing or for JF to spend 3 hours since she was in an assistive role. As for attendance at the appeal hearing itself,
the court notes the Appeal Hearing took place from 9:57am to 10:31am (ie 34 minutes). Costs for attendance of hearing should be assessed
accordingly. 16.  Sixthly, I do not agree the involvement of 3 professional fee-earners meant, as P suggested, party-and-party costs were increased
by 300%. It was plain from D’s statement of costs that each professional fee-earner incurred different time-costs which meant they
did not triplicate every task. I have assessed the items of costs as above albeit on a broad-brush basis. 17.  Upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary and its costs reasonable” on the sensible
standard as explained by the Court of Appeal, the total costs of D on the statement of costs are assessed at $58,000. Lest it be suggested that the scale of reduction by this assessment in respect of costs claimed by D was different/more than the
reduction by Master Leong in respect of D’s claimed costs in the court below (and as upheld by this court), it must be remembered
that the context was wholly different and Master Leong’s assessment concerned not only the costs of the Set Aside Summons (for
which more work was required than for the appeal) as well as costs of the action.","Date of the plaintiff’s Summary of Objections: 15 December 2016Date of Decision on Summary Assessment of

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. NEW HARVEST INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 30; HCMP 1361/2005 (11 January 2017),"177.  So’s written closing submissions for NH stated “我在網上閱續過閣下的履歷, 你曾經是位資深大律師, 替中資銀行打過很多官司,
你係一位對銀行運作非常熟識的大律師, 可以堪稱為專家”. I am quite unable to see the relevance of such submissions
to the merits of the present action, especially when there was no application for recusal. In any event, Mr Leung on behalf of So
herself trading as WF made clear he would not rely on such submissions. 178.  In conclusion, I find DBS was not in breach of contract or in breach of duty of care in not advising So/WF to require a COI for
the Subject LC and/or in releasing payment under the Subject LC. In the circumstances, So’s/WF’s claim in HCA2807/2004 is dismissed.
I also grant a costs order nisi that So/WF shall pay DBS’ costs of HCA2807/2004 (including costs of the counterclaim and all costs reserved if any) to be taxed
if not agreed on indemnity basis,[67] and that So’s/WF’s own costs in HCA2807/2004 be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations. 179.  In respect of HCMP1361/2005, I find So/WF was liable to repay the Subject TR Loan with interest to DBS pursuant to the WF Letter,

Mr Wong further admitted, in the course of his submissions, that there might be existing beneficiaries to the estate of the 2nd plaintiff (eg his distant relatives) who could obtain a grant of representation, but it would involve “much effort and costs to
find the true beneficiaries”.  In my view, the purpose of Order 15, rule 6A is not to provide a shortcut to enable a person who
has no interest in the estate of a deceased person to be appointed as his representative for the purpose of legal proceedings.  In
view of the fact that the present application is made on an ex parte basis by the 1st plaintiff, it is, I consider, the duty of the 1st plaintiff to satisfy the court that (i) without the representation order the 1st plaintiff will not be able to proceed with the action on his own against the defendant, and (ii) he has taken all reasonable steps
to trace the beneficiaries to the 2nd plaintiff’s estate.  I do not consider that the 1st plaintiff has satisfied the court of either matter. 24.  In all, I am not prepared, in the exercise of my discretion, to make the representation order sought by the 1st plaintiff. 25.

THE LIQUIDATOR OF WING FAI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. YIP KWONG ROBERT AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 34; HCCW 735/2002 (11 January 2017),"4.  By s 47 of the Evidence Ordinance the court is required, in civil proceedings, not to exclude evidence on the ground that it is hearsay unless it is objected to and
“the court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the exclusion of the evidence is not prejudicial
to the interests of justice��� (s 47(1)(b)).  The 1st and 3rd respondents had not objected to the admission of the evidence. 5.  Under Order 38 rule 21, where a party tenders a statement of a person as hearsay evidence without calling him, the court may allow other parties to call
and cross‑examine that person.  None of the respondents had applied to call Mr Chim or Ms Julia Ip for cross‑examination under
that rule.  I do not say that in every case a hearsay statement should be held admissible simply because the other side has not applied
for cross‑examination of the maker of the statement, but it is part of the circumstances that I may take into account.  In fact
I was told by counsel that Mr Chim could not be found by either side and so no subpoena could be served on him.  As regards Ms Julia
Ip there was no direct explanation why she had not been called, though the applicant would raise no objection if she was to be called
by the 2nd respondent for cross‑examination.  Mr Barlow SC said she was in Hong Kong but Ms Chan SC was not in a position to confirm it. 
Ms Chan SC submitted that the evidence of Ms Julia Ip was mainly relevant for establishing the applicant’s case as against the
1st and 3rd respondents, who had not made the same admissions as the 2nd respondent. Although both Mr Chim and Ms Ip had given assistance to the liquidators, that happened in 2004.  The latest contact between
the liquidators and Mr Chim that Mr Barlow SC could point to was in 2008.  The hearsay statements in dispute here had been with the
2nd respondent for a long time, but (with the exception of the interview of Mr Chim) only came into the applicant’s possession two
months before the trial, in August 2016.  6.  I am mindful that serious allegations are being made against the respondents including allegations of fraud, and that in such cases
the court will be reluctant to act on evidence untested by cross‑examination: see In re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, 308.  But these concerns can in my view adequately be dealt with in the evaluation of the evidence, attributing such weight to the
evidence in question as may be appropriate taking into account all the relevant factors including those set out in s 49 of the Evidence Ordinance.  In all the circumstances I was not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to exclude the evidence altogether at this stage.
 The question of weight of course looms large.",Reasons for Ruling: 11 January 2017(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First Instance High Court,/2017/34.html,"

"DAH SING BANK, LTD v. RETKIE CO LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 145; HCMP 297/2016 (11 January 2017)","7.  As regards the 1st defendant’s argument that it had acted reasonably in trying to discharge its liabilities to the plaintiff, I do not believe that
it constitutes a valid defence to these proceedings.  The court may be sympathetic to the predicaments in which the 1st defendant had found itself due to unforeseen turn of events, but its task is to uphold the rights of the parties in accordance with
the terms of the mortgages.  8.  Finally, the 1st defendant’s contention that there should be a surplus in the event of sale of the property, and therefore it should be allowed
to sell the property by itself, is premised upon the proposition that the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation will discharge 80% of the
loan which it has guaranteed.  Given that the plaintiff has the contractual entitlement to decide on the manner in which to enforce
its rights, this contention must also be rejected.  9.  In the premises, I make an order in terms of the draft order before the court. ",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/145.html,"

SO SAU LAI CONNIE T/A WING FUNG TRADING CO v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD [2017] HKCFI 646; HCA 2807/2004 (11 January 2017),"177.  So’s written closing submissions for NH stated “我在網上閱續過閣下的履歷, 你曾經是位資深大律師, 替中資銀行打過很多官司,
你係一位對銀行運作非常熟識的大律師, 可以堪稱為專家”. I am quite unable to see the relevance of such submissions
to the merits of the present action, especially when there was no application for recusal. In any event, Mr Leung on behalf of So
herself trading as WF made clear he would not rely on such submissions. 178.  In conclusion, I find DBS was not in breach of contract or in breach of duty of care in not advising So/WF to require a COI for
the Subject LC and/or in releasing payment under the Subject LC. In the circumstances, So’s/WF’s claim in HCA2807/2004 is dismissed.
I also grant a costs order nisi that So/WF shall pay DBS’ costs of HCA2807/2004 (including costs of the counterclaim and all costs reserved if any) to be taxed
if not agreed on indemnity basis,[67] and that So’s/WF’s own costs in HCA2807/2004 be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations. 179.  In respect of HCMP1361/2005, I find So/WF was liable to repay the Subject TR Loan with interest to DBS pursuant to the WF Letter,
WF Agreement and Mortgage, and consequently NH was also liable to pay the Subject TR Loan with interest to DBS pursuant to Mortgage,
and Hui was liable to pay the sum of HK$500,000 with interest to DBS pursuant to the Guarantee. In light of developments in paragraph

took a position on the legal effect of the Deeds of Licence that was, in my view, wrong, and steadfastly maintained it throughout
the correspondence.  But that is not a reason here to order indemnity costs.  It has to be borne in mind that the plaintiffs chose
to call the documents “licences” and to stipulate that they should not be construed as creating any tenancy. 5.  Given the extent to which the parties have each prevailed on the question of costs, I shall make no order as to the costs of the

Mr Li on behalf of KPMG suggested that this application is not for a variation of paragraph 1.3 of the February order as it is framed
in the summons, but in the nature of a new application, although he took no point in respect of this.  It seems to me that nothing
of substance turns on this issue.  I will order that paragraph 1.3 of the February order is varied to replace “31 December 2009”
with “31 December 2010”. 20.  The final matter concerns the publication of my February decision, which has not been uploaded onto the Judiciary website because
of concerns that the MOF might be reluctant to cooperate further if my reasons are made public at this stage.  I think it is desirable
that my reasons are made public as soon as possible, because they deal with matters of some importance.  However, I will delay doing
so until after the revised order for production has been implemented and it is clearer how the MOF responds to it. 21.  In the light of my conclusions in my view it is appropriate that KPMG pay the costs of those paragraphs of both summonses that have

application for leave to supply the court documents to the DoJ had been previously applied for by the SFC, it would have been granted
for the purpose of enabling the DoJ to consider whether to intervene.  This is in light of the circumstances that the SJ had a clear
interest to intervene in the proceedings because of the constitutional and public importance of the challenge to section 181.  I
do not consider that there has been any wilful or serious infraction of the order.  As far as I can ascertain, no prejudice or inconvenience
has been caused as a result of the provision of the court documents by the SFC to the DoJ.  33.  It is also of significance that the Court in allowing the joinder of the SJ as an intervener, it would as a party to the proceedings
have full access to the court documents in any event.  34.  In light of the foregoing, I do not consider that the order sought, even in its amended form, is an appropriate order for this Court

of the present action. P’s case was also bolstered by the Report which showed (a) cultivation at Lot 597 from 1963 until 1984 (consistent
with P’s case that she and Choi grew vegetables until about 1988) and scrubs and trees since 1990 (consistent with P’s case that
sugar cane was grown between 1989 and 1992 and fruit trees since 1992), and (b) cultivation at Lot 738 in 1963 that turned to trees
(since 1977), scrubs (since 1984), bushes (1994) and trees (since 2004) (consistent with P’s case that banana trees were grown
before 1990 and various kinds of fruit trees were grown after 1990). 49.  I am also persuaded that P and her family had occupied and used Lots 597 ad 738 exclusively, and that Choi and P had acquired the

formed a thick wooded area.

                The area was covered by the Agricultural and Fisheries Department Irrigation Project (established in 1972 but unused
at the time of the Report). Trees evident at the time of the Report were longan, skeels (wampi) and custard apple. The area was mainly

According to the 4th and 5th Defendants, the financial condition of the 1st Defendant is healthy.  It was only because the Plaintiff could not identify the location of the 1st Defendant’s assets that the two sets of Mainland legal proceedings did not produce much fruitful result.  However, if the Defendants
were not evasive about their assets, I cannot think of any logical reason as to why the Plaintiff would not have continued the legal
proceedings in the Mainland, as it had already commenced not just one but two set of legal proceedings against them in the first
place.  One must bear in mind that the Plaintiff had already made two attempts to sue the Defendants in the alternative forum but
without much result.   Hence, the Plaintiff’s complaint about the loss of juridical advantages is one with substance and I also
find in favour of the Plaintiff in the Stage II inquiry. 57.  I turn proceed to Stage III.  Whilst one may certainly argue that the juridical disadvantages suffered by the Plaintiff are not
particularly serious, the fundamental problem remains, without knowing the nature of the dispute between the parties, the court would
not be able to assess the advantages if the trial is conducted in the Nanjing Court.   The court is therefore not in a position to
conduct the balancing exercise under the Stage III inquiry.  In my judgment, as the 4th and 5th Defendants should be held responsible for failing to put forward the crucial information necessary for the conduct of the balancing
exercise, the court should also find in favour of the Plaintiff in the Stage III inquiry.  Hence, the 4th and 5th Defendants fail in all stages of the inquiry. 58.  For the above reasons, I dismiss their stay application and order them to file the Defence within 28 days.  I also make a costs

by the Japanese regulators.  The applicants express incredulity that there would have been no discussion about the transmission of
materials from the SFC to the Japanese regulators, and the expectations concerning the use and disclosure.  The SFC in response has
stated in its affirmation evidence that it had not provided any information or documents obtained from the applicants to the Japanese
regulators during these meetings and are therefore not relevant to any of the issues in the present proceedings because no materials
were disclosed at the meetings which were concerned.  It would be expected that regulators with a common interest in a matter under

doubt the nature and subject of these meetings as explained by the SFC.  The critical issue is whether there is any relevant information

HKSAR v. YEUNG HOI SHAN [2017] HKCFI 62; HCMA 202/2016 (16 January 2017),"24.  Nevertheless, given the positive good character of the appellant and the fact that both parties appeared to be in error/some confusion
before the court below, I took the view, in my discretion, that the fairer way forward was to give the appellant the opportunity
to place before this court admissible evidence as to his ingestion of prescription medicine that evening.  He did so. In the form
of Dr Chan and by giving evidence himself.  In the end this did not avail him.  Dr Chan gave evidence as to why and what had been
prescribed to the appellant and that he had explained the effects of alcohol combined with these prescription drugs.  He explained
that he had been concerned about the increasing level of the appellant’s intake of alcohol over the period he had treated him and
that he had advised him frequently of the combined effects of alcohol and drugs and that this could lead to a loss of inhibition.
 His evidence was that the real risk of intoxication, if there was any in the circumstances of this case, came from the 1.5 mg of
Bromazepam rather than the other two drugs which had been prescribed and the effect of the Bromazepam after 20 hours would depend
upon a number of circumstances but would be at the lower end.  In his opinion, the combined effect of Bromazepam with alcohol would
depend upon the time between the consumption of the two, the speed of consumption of alcohol, the amount of alcohol, the amount the
patient had eaten and his general health.  Whilst Dr Chan explained the drugs prescribed and their potential effect upon the appellant,
it became clear that their effect would have been towards the lower end at the time this offending took place in the evening of 5
June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking the medicine.  It was also clear that the appellant had voluntarily and knowingly drank
an excessive amount of sake (ten glasses) in a relatively short space of time and was aware of his inebriation after visiting the
fourth of ten tables, yet he did not stop drinking.  That inebriation brought out the worst in him.  He behaved in a disgraceful
way towards Miss Yeung and the police officers.  He showed some remorse before this court about his behaviour towards the police
officers but absolutely no remorse at all in respect of his behaviour towards the young lady whom he assaulted that evening.  His
attitude in court suggested that his behaviour that night had nothing to do with prescription medicine or alcohol but more to do
with his attitude to young women generally even when sober. 25.  Having given the appellant the benefit of the doubt and allowed him to adduce admissible evidence of involuntary intoxication before
this court, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the dangers of consuming alcohol whilst on prescription
drugs and that the appellant nevertheless went on to do so.  He did so on 5 June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking his medicine,
when the risk of the combined effect of alcohol and drugs was near its lowest end and was far less likely to have any significant
effect.  He voluntarily and knowingly drank an excessive amount of sake and continued to do so even after he knew he had become inebriated.
 He went on to assault Miss Yeung and the police officers who were brought in to prevent further mishap and he is fully responsible
for that behaviour.  Accordingly I dismiss this appeal. 26.  Costs of the appeal be to the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.","Date of Judgment: 16 January 2017(A P Campbell‑Moffat)

claim for non-refoulement protection under the unified screening mechanism may still be decided within a reasonable time in the foreseeable
future, so as to justify the continued detention of the applicant. 10.  In this regard, I take into account that in the very near future there will be a hearing of the applicant’s appeal at the Torture
Claims Appeal Board (“TCAB”) on 24 February 2017.  I also take into account that as early as 26 May 2016, TCAB had acknowledged the urgency of the applicant’s
appeal/petition against the Director’s decision in refusing his non-refoulement claim and had confirmed its decision to accord
priority to the applicant’s appeal/petition. Based on the available information, there is insufficient basis to suggest that the
hearing before the TCAB cannot go ahead as scheduled on 24 February 2017, whether because of the applicant’s alleged mental condition

in mind the Experts are overseas, and the interview with P and other relevant persons will be held overseas and has to be arranged,
this court has refrained from imposing any particular deadline, and leaves the matter to the good sense of the parties. However,
parties are reminded of paragraphs 75-78 of Practice Direction 18.1, and the court may vary any committed date for compiling expert
reports if the circumstances require. 35.  As to costs, both P and Ds have succeeded to some extent on the questions to be put to the Experts. However, some costs are unnecessarily
incurred as explained in the earlier part of this Decision in relation to the joint application for paper disposal. In the circumstances,
I grant a cost order nisi that 75% of the costs of and occasioned by the applications in respect of the Issue be costs in the cause, and P’s own costs be

SMART TRIKE MNF. PTE. LTD AND ANOTHER v. FUNG KWOK HOI AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 74; HCA 1989/2014 (18 January 2017),"8.  Though I do not grant judgment in favour of the 2nd Plaintiff, I take the view that there is some justification for the joinder of the 2nd Plaintiff.  To me, the extra costs of having the 2nd Plaintiff in the proceedings are quite minimal, but the inclusion of him as a party in the proceedings can save the trouble of dealing
with any unnecessary technical challenges relating to the ownership of the Copyright Works.  The question of ownership of a particular
piece of copyright work may not be a straightforward matter.  If the Defendants were to take issue with the ownership of the Copyright
Works, the Plaintiffs would then have to explain as to why the ownership of copyright relating to a drawing prepared by a particular
employee would finally vest in the 1st Plaintiff.  To avoid any unnecessary challenges, there is some justification for the joinder of the 2nd Plaintiff.  In particular, the costs associated with the joinder should be minimal. 9.   For the above reasons, I am of the view that the fair order for costs vis-à-vis the 2nd Plaintiff and the Defendants is one of no order as to costs of the action including the costs of the summary judgment application.
 I therefore so order. 10.   For the avoidance of doubt, this application only relates to the costs of the claim by the 2nd Plaintiff.

SARAS GOPI v. BINA DEEGAN [2017] HKCFI 295; HCA 3075/2015 (19 January 2017),"14.  It is said on behalf of Mrs Deegan that Mrs Gopi has a track record of taking such steps as she can to defeat the claims of her
creditors.  I am not in a position to judge that, because it assumes that various adverse findings will be made against Mrs Gopi
at the trial of the action, and I am not prepared to make that assumption.  Having said that, though, there is unfortunately so much
animosity between the parties in this case that Mrs Gopi might be tempted to put such assets which she has beyond the reach of her
daughter.  The fact is that the court should not ignore the practical realities of a dispute of this kind. Moreover, this application
for security for costs is seeking to protect Mrs Deegan against not being able to enforce an order for costs in her favour at the
end of the trial which is still a long time off.  Anything can happen to Mrs Gopi’s assets in that time.  All in all, therefore,
although it may be possible for Mrs Deegan to enforce any order for costs made in her favour, that is no more than a possibility,
and in any event the enforcement of orders made in Hong Kong against overseas assets could well be a costly exercise.  In the circumstances,
I do not think that these considerations should deter me from making an appropriate order for security for costs. 15.  But what is the appropriate order in this case?  Three points need to be made. First, since it is argued on behalf of Mrs Deegan,
and I agree, that there is very little overlap between the claims and the counterclaims, it follows that the sum which Mrs Gopi should
be ordered to provide by way of security should not include the costs of the loan claim, the share claim, the property claim and
the assault claim.  Otherwise, the order would be tantamount to requiring Mrs Gopi to provide security to her daughter for the prosecution
of the counterclaim.  A skeleton bill of costs prepared by Mrs Deegan’s solicitors does not exclude those costs. 16.  Secondly, the skeleton bill of costs (which covers the period up to the date of setting down) includes expenditure on items which
may not be incurred, for example, it includes the costs of applications for specific discovery, for further and better particulars
and for letters of request for the taking of evidence abroad.  Although Mr Morrison for Mrs Deegan assures me that those applications
will be made, you never know with certainty in litigation what is going to happen.  Thirdly, the skeleton bill of costs, is pitched
at a level greater than I think the bill would be taxed at, including, for example, the solicitors’ hourly rates.  It is completely
inappropriate for me to subject the bill to an item by item analysis.  Everyone agrees that nothing but a broad-brush approach is
appropriate.  Applying such an approach, I think that I should order Mrs Gopi to provide her daughter with security for costs in
the sum of $2,000,000.00. Subject to any further submissions on the topic,  I propose to stay all proceedings on the claim until
that security is provided.  I shall hear from the parties how that security should be provided.",Date of Hearing: 19 January 2017Date of Judgment: 19 January 2017,"(Brian Keith)

For the above reasons, at the hearing, I ordered that judgment be entered against the 2nd defendant in respect of the Sum, but refused granting the declaratory relief (as well as the consequential relief of account) in
favour of the plaintiff in respect of its constructive trust claim. 29.  In its application, the plaintiff also asks me to vary the Mareva injunction so as to permit that the plaintiff to withdraw the Sum from the 2nd defendant’s account.  Such application is not an application under Order 19, rule 7.  I have no jurisdiction to grant such application
at the hearing and was not prepared to do so without any proper application supported by proper evidence.  In any event, I doubt
very much whether such variation if necessary.  Even if it turns out to be necessary, the plaintiff can still make an application
for variation with proper evidence in support there and then. 30.  Last but not the least, I wish to thank Mr Ng for his assistance and also for his sensible way in handling this application.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 20 January 2017(Anson Wong SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/87.html,"

SIT ANDREW v. OTS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LTD [2017] HKCFI 89; HCLA 20/2016 (20 January 2017),"14.  The Presiding Officer was well aware of the conflicting evidence concerning Mr Sit’s actual work hours after the agreement to
vary was allegedly reached. I agree with his analysis. Mr Sit was merely given liberty to work lesser hours but if he so wished he
could certainly keep the same hours or even work longer hours. The pay cut was the direct result of the poor start of the business
of the Company. There must be incentive for him to work harder so as to improve the business of the Company. The Presiding Officer
very fairly accepted his allegation that he worked more or less the same hours but this is of marginal relevance to the core factual
issue as to the existence of the agreement to vary only. 15.  For the reasons given above, I cannot accept that Mr Sit is able to show that the Presiding Officer erred in law or that his factual findings were perverse and/or irrational. The authorities
cited by him have no relevance to his application at all. Mr Sit’s application for leave to appeal must fail and I dismiss it accordingly. 16.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision: 20 January 2017(Kent Yee),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/89.html,"

MA WAI CHIU v. NG KIN FAI RICHARD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 317; HCA 61/2017 (20 January 2017),"14.  Mr Chain accepted that the disclosure which Mr Ma had originally sought was “ambitious” and could properly be regarded as “overkill”.
 That concession applies particularly to the requirement to disclose any assets in the defendants’ possession valued at $50,000.00
or more.  Such an order is, on the face of it, no longer necessary in the light of the payment into court which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam
are prepared to make.  But in any event, disclosure of this kind may well be appropriate when an order seeking the freezing of all
of a defendant’s assets up to a certain amount is sought.  The plaintiff will want to know what assets the defendant has in order
to police any freezing order he obtains.  But this is not that sort of case.  There is no freezing order sought in respect of all
the defendants’ assets up to a certain amount.  The freezing order which is sought is limited to the receivables which have been
paid to PSG and YMH.  All in all, the disclosure which Mr Ma is entitled to at this particular stage of the proceedings must be limited
to that disclosure which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam are prepared to give.  15.  That deals with the contentious issues which arise on Mr Ma’s summons, and I am confident that I can leave it to the parties to
draw up an order which reflects the terms of this judgment. 16.  I think that the appropriate order for costs is that the costs of today be reserved to the judge who hears the application on the
return date, with liberty to apply in the event of there not being a return date and the parties not being able to agree the costs
which I have just reserved.",Date of Judgment: 20 January 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/317.html,"

first letter, there is a date on which the letter was faxed to the recipient.  D4 admits that the evidence would have great impact
on the result of the case as he said they “contained very serious allegations against the 4th Defendant which could have significant impact on the case...”[5]  To exclude them would obviously prejudice P’s case. Pursuant to s.47 of the Evidence Ordinance, they should be admissible, subject to the weight to be given by the trial judge.  The question as to what weight should be accorded
to these letters is a matter for the trial judge.  D4 may raise those questions and inconsistencies between the letters and other
evidence as set out in the written submissions before the trial judge. P, D4 and D5 are at liberty to call Mr. Cosimo Borrelli and
Mr. Robert Siu or the handling solicitor of this case or either of them to give witness statement or to issue subpoenas to secure

overseas counsel would be able to make a significant contribution to the hearing by reason of his expertise.   20.  Turning to the facts of the present case, there is no dispute over the specialty and experience of the applicant.  Given that the
hearing is going to be a substantial one – bearing in mind its importance to Mr Chan and the issues and arguments that will be
involved, and having had the benefit of hearing some of these arguments at the hearing as they were presented by Mr Man, I have come
to the conclusion that the applicant, if admitted, would be able to make a significant contribution to the hearing. 21.  This being the case, and having borne in mind all other relevant considerations urged upon the court – particularly the undertaking
given by Mr Chan that if the applicant is admitted to lead the application for leave to appeal before the Appeal Committee, both

SUM MUN KID FREDERICK v. AUTO ITALIA LTD [2017] HKCFI 316; HCA 60/2017 (23 January 2017),"9.  In any event, however the application is framed, the real issue of substance is whether the information sought by Mr Sum needs to
be given now, or whether a decision on what information should be disclosed can await the hearing of the summons.  I know that the
information which is sought goes to the heart of the case, its materiality being beyond question because it is highly relevant to
whether the company has indeed sold the cars, and if it has, whether it has sold them to bona fide purchasers for value without notice of Mr Sum’s rights.  I appreciate that the information would enable Mr Sum’s solicitors to
begin inquiries now about the genuineness of the sales.  But Mr Sum is protected from any disposal of the cars in the future if the
sales which are alleged already to have taken place are found not to have been genuine sales at all by the continuation of the injunctions.
 I have not discerned any downside for Mr Sum if the question of disclosure of the purchasers’ identities is deferred until the
hearing of the summons. 10.  I therefore propose to make an order along the lines of paras 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the order sought by Mr Sum in para 18 of Mr Westbrook’s
speaking note for today, but not along the lines of para 3.  This matches in its entirety the consent order which the company’s
solicitors proposed last week, but which Mr Sum’s solicitors did not agree to because they wanted the court to make the further
order for disclosure. 11.  I think the appropriate order to make today is that all the costs arising out of the summons be reserved to the judge who is to
hear the summons, save that the company’s costs of today be paid by Mr Sum, to be taxed if not agreed, but not paid until the conclusion
of the trial of the action.",Date of Judgment: 23 January 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/316.html,"

as Lot Nos 1331 and 1333 in Demarcation District No 129 (“The Lots”), HCMP 2602/2006, I am satisfied that the present case falls within section 45(e), Trustee Ordinance (Cap 29) in that there is no personal representative of Chun Fai who was entitled to or possessed of the legal title of the subject
premises, or it is uncertain who is the personal representative of Chun Fai who was entitled to or possessed of the legal title. 4.  I am further satisfied that it is an appropriate case to vest the legal title of the subject premises in the applicants as joint

LUCY MICHAELS v. THE APEX HORIZON [2017] HKCFI 113; HCPI 900/2016 (25 January 2017),"18.  Indeed, it would be a sad day for our society if the public see that they should find remedy in court for every negative feeling
they experienced for any perceived lack of courtesy, inconsiderate behavior, temper outburst or dissatisfaction.  Such behaviours
may well be entirely unjustifiable and inappropriate, but, regrettably, they are (and will always be) everyday occurrences in human
interactions that any reasonable person should have learned to cope and deal with by means other than litigation in court. 19.  For the reasons above, I find that the plaintiff’s claim to be entirely frivolous and vexatious, and is a clear case of an abuse
of the process of the court. 20.  I will therefore order that:-",Date of Hearing: 3 January 2017Date of Decision: 25 January 2017,"(Harold Leong)

LAI PUI LING SUING BY HER BROTHER AND NEXT FRIEND LAI HIN HO v. HO CHI KEUNG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 118; [2017] 1 HKLRD 1248; HCPI 464/2014 (25 January 2017),"21.  I am therefore driven to the conclusion that on the basis of the facts averred and the legal conclusions I have reached in my previous
judgment, particulars (iii), (vi) and (vii) are not capable, taken singly or in combination, of supporting the default judgment against
the 1st defendant.  Nor is there any suggestion that there are additional averments that could reasonably be made that could sustain a finding
of breach of an independent duty on the part of the 1st defendant. This is not surprising given that on the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff at trial, there was no contact at
all between the wakeboarders and the 1st defendant.  This is accordingly not a case where the plaintiff can credibly say there are other allegations which she could have
put into the statement of claim but which she did not because she had already obtained judgment by default. 22.  Mr Kwan submitted that since the default judgment here was a regular judgment, the court should, in deciding whether or not to set
it aside, pay regard to the discretionary circumstances such as why the default occurred; the defendant’s conduct after he had
notice of the proceedings; an explanation of any delay in making the application; and any prejudice caused to the plaintiff or third
parties.  In my opinion these factors may have more significance in the usual, pre‑trial situation where the defendant is only
required to show a real prospect of success, although even then merits is often said to be the dominant factor.  In the present type
of case, where the defendant can show that the plaintiff has no arguable case at all in light of the judgment in favour of a co-defendant,
those factors can in my view have but little weight. 23.  For these reasons the default judgment against the 1st defendant must in my judgment be set aside.  To dispose of the action formally, the statement of claim should be struck out as against
the 1st defendant and judgment entered for dismissal of the action as against him.  On a nisi basis, I would let the costs fall where they lie and thus make no order.  The plaintiff’s own costs are to be taxed in accordance
with the Legal Aid Regulations.","Date of Judgment: 25 January 2017(Godfrey Lam)

the 1st and 2nd grounds, this 3rd ground must necessarily fall away in view of my discussions and conclusions on 1st and 2nd grounds above. 82.  In my view, bearing in mind the high degree of scrutiny required, neither the DOI nor the Adjudicator made any reviewable error
in coming to the essential findings in their respective decisions. I find they respectively had given sufficient reasons for coming
to those findings, which reasons were rational and sound. AT failed to demonstrate that any of the intended grounds of review was
reasonably arguable. In all the circumstances, there was no justifiable basis for extension of time for AT to apply for leave to
apply for judicial review. 83.  I therefore dismiss AT’s application for leave to judicially review the DOI Decision and Adjudicator Decision in respect of his

I agree with Mr Lam that the decision in System Control plc was nothing more than an application of trite Order 14 principles, albeit in the context of statutory and contractual causes of action.
The factual context in that case was far removed from the present case where there was simply an action on contract with no statutory
cause of action. The real question must be whether there was any triable issue or arguable defence, and on the aforesaid analysis
there was none in the present action. 64.  The Appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I grant a costs order nisi that D shall forthwith pay P costs of the Appeal to be summarily assessed. I also give directions for the summary assessment of costs
as follows: 65.  At the Appeal Hearing, I raised with Mr Chu the issue of actual/ potential conflict of interest between D and his present solicitors
LHC, and urged him to consider the matter with D and LHC. D’s stance was set out in paragraph 11 above, ie Yancy and not P was
D’s estate agent for the Transaction. However, LHC were the solicitors who acted for D in relation to the Cancellation Agreement
which reiterated and confirmed the PASP, and which recited P as D’s agent and also the terms of the PASP including clause 10a without
any mention of Yancy at all. This did not sit well with D’s case put forward to this court at the Appeal Hearing. As a matter of
professional conduct, it is essential that LHC should properly address such apparent conflict.","Clause 2

words, if the defendant did set such limit and the plaintiff’s costs did substantially exceed the same, it is highly likely for
me to disallow them in these taxation proceedings even though it may be arguable that the Law Society’s commentary is strictly
speaking not binding on this court[6]. 32.  To conclude, I am not of the view that the 64 items in question which involve the participation of 2 fee earners charging $4,000
per hour each are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred.  The defendant’s application for review must be
dismissed.  I see no reason why the costs shall not follow the event.  I make an order nisi that the defendant do pay costs of the
review application including all costs reserved with certificate for counsel, which shall become absolute unless any parties applies

that summons to be heard at the same time as the strike‑out summons in the action against ISS, whether or not the two actions have
been formally consolidated in the meantime.  An estimate of three hours for the hearing of both summonses may well be right, and
since the summons to strike out the new statement of claim has not yet been issued, and it will take some time for the evidence for
that summons to be filed, it will take at least some time before that summons will be ready to be heard.  I cannot estimate precisely
when the parties will be ready for that summons to be heard, but in my opinion, it is premature to fix an early date for a hearing
of both the strike‑out summonses when the strike‑out summons in the action against CMC has not yet even been issued. 12.  In the circumstances, the date currently fixed for the hearing of ISS’s strike‑out summons should stand, and it follows that
both appeals should be dismissed. 13.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Judgment: 27 January 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/318.html,"

RE THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF PACIFIC ANDES ENTERPRISES (BVI) LTD [2017] HKCFI 649; HCMP 3560/2016 (27 January 2017),"6.  The increasing number of applications for recognition and assistance in recent years has allowed a form of order to emerge that
this Court will generally be prepared to grant on written application made pursuant to a letter of request.  Such applications can
be granted very quickly.  I note for the benefit of practitioners that although such applications are very familiar to me, they will
not necessarily be familiar to other judges who hear company matters, and applications should comply with Practice Direction 3.5 and be accompanied by a paginated and indexed hearing bundle to assist the court in processing them quickly.  In the present case
it was not. 7.  I am satisfied having read the supporting affirmations, the Letters of Requests and having regard to the principles explained in
the authorities to which I have referred, that the orders sought by the Liquidators should be granted.  The form of order differs
in one respect from those that have been granted in recent cases.  That is the proposed addition of sub-paragraph (a) referred to
in paragraph 4 above.  I agree that expressly providing a power to this effect would probably assist the Liquidators, but in my view
the proposed wording might be read as giving them a right to obtain from third parties documents that the Liquidators are not entitled
to without an order of the Court pursuant to section 221(3) of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, Cap 32, or some other statutory or common law power.  As the law in Hong Kong currently stands even under section 221(3) a liquidator only has the right to obtain documents “relating to the company”, not documents, which cannot properly and fairly
be described as relating to the company, but concern its promotion and the other matters referred to in section 221(1).  This is explained in my decision in The Joint and Several Liquidators of China Medical Technologies Inc [8], which is currently under appeal.  I am, however, prepared to grant the following order: 8.  I have appended to this decision the form of order granted.","Date of Reasons for Decision: 27 January 2017(Jonathan Harris)

THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KAN OKE v. LEE YIU KEI AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 799; HCMP 33/2014 (27 January 2017),"12.  In respect of RPO, Madam Leung refers to two previous claims at the Small Claims Tribunal wherein, she asserts, that the plaintiff’s
claims were dismissed.  However, the substance of those claims or orders of the Tribunal have not been placed before this court.
 There is simply no way in which the court can assess if the plaintiff has re-litigated matters that have been adjudicated upon.
 An RPO is not justified. 13.  None of the applications set out in the summons dated 13 January 2017 have been established or are justified.  I therefore dismiss
the summons. 14.  I summarily assess and allow the costs at $10,000, to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiff within 14 days.","andLEE YIU KEI and

If the amended petition can survive this striking application, Mr Zhi may consider re-amending it to rely on s. 724 of the Companies Ordinance; Cap. 622 as against the other respondents.  But the amended petition cannot survive this attack, there is therefore no point in
allowing him to re-amend the amended petition to plead to s. 724.  49.  In the premises, I struck out the amended petition in so far as the Respondents are concerned.  50.  Since the amended petition is a re-run of Mr Zhi’s previous claims against the 1st respondent, it is an abuse of the process of the court.

PANDORA A/S AND ANOTHER v. PANDORA CO LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 672; HCA 2411/2015 (3 February 2017),"3.  The creation of shadow companies of this kind was considered by Zervos J in Power Dekor (Hong Kong) Ltd v Power Dekor Group Co Ltd (HCA 1139/2013). He did not doubt that the use of the documents relating to the incorporation of such shadow companies in Hong Kong
to pass off goods in Mainland China as if they were those of companies in the same position as the plaintiffs amounted to the tort
of passing‑off.  Nor do I.  I am satisfied that each of the defendants has been duly served with the writ with the statement of
claim endorsed on it that each of them has failed to serve a defence (indeed, none of them has filed an acknowledgement of service),
and that each of them has been duly served with the summons seeking judgment in default of defence and has been notified of today’s
hearing.  In the circumstances, I enter judgment for the plaintiffs against each of the defendants, and I make the orders sought
in paras 1 – 8 of each of the summonses. 4.  I have been asked to assess the plaintiffs’ costs summarily.  I am prepared to do that.  I assess the manual work in section B
of the plaintiffs’ statements of costs in the sum claimed of $1,892.  But there will inevitably have been a great deal of duplication
in respect of the work in sections C and D of the statements.  For example, once one set of documents had been prepared, which I
accept may well have taken six hours, it would not have taken anything like that to prepare similar documents for the other six defendants.
 All that needed to be done was to change some of the details.  The same applies to much of the other work which the plaintiffs’
solicitors had to do.  It is not possible for me to say precisely how much work was done for each case, but even taking into account
the time spent on carrying out company searches on each of the defendants, I believe that if I were to assess the plaintiffs’ costs
at one-third of the stated cost of the work in sections C and D of the statements, I would be close to the mark. 5.  Accordingly, I summarily assess the plaintiffs’ costs in each of the cases at $8,884 — in other words, $1,892 for the work set
out in section B of the statements, $1,500 for the work set out in section C of the statements and $5,492 for the work set out in
section D of the statements — and I order each defendant to pay that sum to the plaintiffs.",Date of Judgment: 3 February 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/672.html,"

COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE v. PANG FAI [2017] HKCFI 154; [2017] 1 HKLRD 1275; HCIA 2/2016 (6 February 2017),"20.  Although I have some reservation on whether it is any longer necessary to resort to either the “economic reality test” or the
“control test” for the purpose of determining whether an employment relationship exists, I have not had the benefit of considering
any contrary submissions by the Taxpayer, understandably because he is currently acting in person.  In view of the fact that I am
here only dealing with an application for leave to appeal, I do not consider that this is an appropriate occasion for me to undertake
a detailed examination of Mr Leung’s legal submissions.  All that I would say is that, having carefully considered the substance
of Mr Leung’s submissions, I am prepared to hold that the Commissioner’s proposed appeal raises a question of law (namely, whether,
for the purpose of determining whether an employment relationship exists, it is any longer necessary to apply, or have regard to,
the “economic reality test” and/or the “control test”), and the proposed appeal has a “reasonable prospect of success”
under Section 69(3)(e) of the Ordinance.  For this purpose, I consider that a proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success
if it is “reasonably arguable”; it is not necessary to show that the proposed appeal will “probably” succeed. 21.  Various other grounds of the Commissioner’s proposed appeal (Grounds 4 to 9) relate to the Board’s treatment of the evidence.
 On their own, I would not be minded to grant leave to appeal.  However, the matters raised in those grounds could, arguably, be
relevant to a holistic evaluation of the facts and circumstances in this case, and therefore relevant to Ground 10 (the so-called
“catch-all” ground) to the effect that the Board came to a decision which no tribunal, properly directed, could reasonably have
reached.  In all the circumstances, I do not propose to limit the grounds on which leave to appeal is granted in the present application. 22.

In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that there is any substance in the contentions of the 2nd defendant, that he was pressured unreasonably into issuing the so‑called guarantee cheque.  There is no other explanation for that
cheque having been issued in fact, other than that the 2nd defendant had indeed offered to guarantee the debt of the 1st defendant (his parent's company), and it follows also therefore that the contention of the 2nd defendant and there was no guarantee given at all also must be seen as being without any substance. 12.  Having considered the evidence before me, I came to the conclusion that there were no triable issues disclosed, and accordingly
I dismissed the 2nd defendants appeal.  The costs of that application are to be to the plaintiff to be taxed if not agreed. 13.  Before closing, I wish to record having discussed with the parties at the appeal the importance of a realistic time estimate being
made when dates are reserved for a hearing.  On any view the time estimate made for the hearing of this appeal of one day, insisted
on, I was told, by the 2nd defendant, was wholly excessive for this particular matter, which was easily concluded within one hour.  Failure to properly address

is very much to be deprecated.","Date of Judgment: 7 February 2017(Anthony Houghton SC)

impact that the inclusion of “custody” would have on the possession counts concerning the 2nd defendant.  I gave Mr Kwok time so he could consider the proposed amendments.  He maintained his objections but had nothing further

any prejudice to receiving a fair trial.  36.  I am of the view that the second re-amendments do not offend any of the principles as submitted to me or cause any prejudice or

not to grant bail.  The presumption of bail can be rebutted by the nature of the offence, the risk of danger to the public, or the
likelihood that the trial could be affected by the defendant absconding or influencing the witness. There is also the factor that
I have mentioned of unreasonable delay.  See HKSAR v Vu Thang Duong [2015] HKCFI 379; [2015] 2 HKLRD 502, at paragraphs 13 to 16. 15.

CHENG TANG KAM YUNG v. TANG KAM CHEUNG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 168; HCMP 147/2008 (8 February 2017),"39.  Another complaint of the 1st Defendant is that the hearing lasted for 50 minutes.  I note that the two summonses were listed for 3 minutes’ hearing only.  That
might be the reason why DHCJ Leung specifically granted a certificate for counsel.  Apparently, the estimate of the 1st Defendant about the hearing time was not accurate when he took out the summonses.  From the documents found in the taxation bundle,
it can be seen that counsel prepared skeleton arguments as well as supplemental submissions.  I do not find the brief fee for counsel
to deal with the two summonses to be excessive or unreasonable, bearing in mind the particular matters of concern in the present
case.  This item is to be allowed in full. 40.  In conclusion, the sum allowed for items 1, 3 and 4 of Section B is to be revised upward from $40,000 to $45,000, and the sum allowed
for item 6 of Section B is to be revised downward from $18,000 to $14,000. There is no change for the other items. 41.  Although there have been revisions in respect of the costs allowed for some of the items, the 1st Defendant is over all in a worse off position.  I therefore order, on a nisi basis, that costs of the review be paid by the 1st Defendant personally to the Plaintiff and to be summarily assessed, if not agreed.  Unless an application for variation of the costs

"
LEE KIN WAI v. LEE KIN CHUEN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 170; HCA 212/2014 (8 February 2017),"43.  At one stage, I was minded to think that different considerations applied to Kin Chuen’s costs.  Kin Chuen never disputed Kin
Wai’s claim to be the sole owner of the Flat.  He did not need to be a party to give his account of the agreement. Kin Wai’s
legal team could have called him to give evidence as a witness. In those circumstances, could it not be said that Kin Chuen was only
made a defendant to U Chan’s counterclaim because he was already a defendant to Kin Wai’s claim?  He would not have been made
a defendant to U Chan’s counterclaim if he was not already a party.  In the circumstances, I was minded to think that U Chan should
not have to bear Kin Chuen’s costs since he was unnecessarily brought into the action by Kin Wai.  However, the better view is
that Kin Wai had to join Kin Chuen as a defendant.  Kin Chuen was one of the legal owners of the Flat, and if a declaration was to
be made to the effect that, despite that, Kin Wai was the sole beneficial owner of the Flat, he had to be a party to the action for
such a declaration to be made.  I therefore make an order nisi that U Chan must pay to Kin Chuen his costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed, though that order may not be enforced without
the leave of the court. 44.  When you apply for a flat under the Scheme, you have to disclose who will be occupying the flat.  In this case, the plan was, as
I have said, for it to be Kin Wai’s home.  Neither Pui Wan nor Kin Chuen were going to be living there.  Yet the Housing Authority
might have been told that either Pui Wan or Kin Chuen would be living in the flat since the application had to be made by them. 
That raises the question whether the Housing Authority might have been misled.  I make no findings about that, of course, since there
would need to be more evidence on the topic, but I asked all counsel whether such a finding might have an impact on the case.  I
had in mind what Litton NPJ said recently[13], that such a circumstance might “have brought into play the principle that a resulting or a constructive trust cannot be enforced
by a contributor if he or she had to rely on such an arrangement to succeed”.  All counsel agreed that it should not affect the
relief I should give. 45.  I mention this only in case the Housing Authority was to allege subsequently that it had been misled.  I am neither encouraging
nor discouraging it to take any action, but should it choose to do so, and if Litton NPJ’s concerns were to apply, it is necessary
for me to state that this judgment only affects the rights of the parties as between themselves and any subsequent purchaser of the
Flat.  The declarations I have made must be subject to any action which the Housing Authority may choose to take.",Date of Handing Down Judgment: 8 February 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/170.html,"

required in pleading a particular head of damage is determined by the need to provide a fair and sufficient indication of the case

of the plea is already sufficient. Further details of such losses are a matter of evidence. As pointed out by this court at paragraph

course was with no determination, or judgment entered, at this time on the plaintiff's application.  The defendants are to be taken
to have admitted the claims made against them in the Statement of Claim, but it appeared to me nevertheless to be premature to enter
a judgment which would involve a declaration imputing fraudulent conduct on the part of these defendants in circumstances in which,
because of the defence pleaded by the 2nd defendant, a trial is likely to be held in which the relevant factual circumstances are closely aligned with, and may overlap, those
relevant to the claim against 5th, 6th and 7th defendants. 23.  There remains the possibility that the trial judge, in due course, in the light of the evidence received, may come to the conclusion
that making such declarations (or granting any of the other relief sought) would be inappropriate.  Therefore, notwithstanding the
deemed admission on the part of the defendants, it appeared to me the better course was to leave the matter open for decision, in
due course by the trial judge, whose discretion, notwithstanding the deemed admission by the defendants, will be exercised in the
light of relevant evidence placed before him or her. 24.  The parties agreed that, in those circumstances, the costs of the summons as between the plaintiff and the 5th 6th and 7th defendants should be to the plaintiff.

WEALTH GUIDE LTD v.  各佔用人 AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 181; HCMP 1678/2013 (9 February 2017),"55.  The situation could be shown to beyond doubt by the plaintiff’s solicitors asking for specific discovery of the related documents.
 They did not do so either because they were making a gamble that Mr Choi’s solicitors would overlook the documents till the end
or they had overlooked the need to ask for them or they had also overlooked the existence of the documents copies of which had already
been given to them.  56.  In any case, there was no material change in Mr Choi’s case when the two documents were produced at the conclusion of Mr Chan’s
evidence.  They merely corroborate the evidence that was in the witness statements.  The strength of Mr Choi’s case was not made
overwhelming by their disclosure.  I also do not think the plaintiff or its solicitors were surprised by the production of the two
documents.  Therefore, the plaintiff was not prejudiced by the late production of the two documents.  Their disclosure during the
trial was not the cause of the plaintiff’s concession.  Their non-disclosure until after the evidence of Mr Chan did not cause
the plaintiff to incur its costs after Mr Choi’s discovery on 14 February 2015.  The plaintiff only made use of the disclosure
as a convenient opportunity to put an end to its opposition to the counterclaim.  In fact, the plaintiff’s offer dated 1 September
2016 shows that it had decided not to oppose the counterclaim on 1 September 2016 long before the commencement of the trial.  It
withdrew the offer because its apprehension of the effect of my direction issued on 5 September which eventually did not assist it. 57.  In the premises, I make a usual costs order of the action that will follow the event.  I order the plaintiff to pay Mr Choi the
costs of the action which includes the counterclaim.  But I order that there be no order as to costs on the two affirmations made
by Mr Leung Wing Hang and that Mr Choi’s solicitors should not charge Mr Choi the costs for making these two affirmations as they
provide no assistance to the court on the costs issue. ",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/181.html,"

ZHANG HENG v. KINGSTONE INTERNATIONAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 182; HCMP 1518/2016 (9 February 2017),"42.  As regards Mr Hu’s argument that Zhang should provide security for the Company’s costs in the derivative action as a condition
for leave (see Re Gen2 Partners Inc, unrep, HCMP 1255/2011, 15 June 2012, §§63-4), it is unnecessary to deal with it.  It is not a straightforward matter and, like
the situation in Re Gen2 Partners Inc, I do not believe that the issues have been fully ventilated.  An application for security for costs can be brought for that purpose.

WADDINGTON LTD v. CHAN CHUN HOO THOMAS AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 654; HCA 3291/2003 (9 February 2017),"28.  In all the circumstances, I would make an order that the 5th defendant do indemnify the plaintiff in respect of any costs reasonably incurred by the plaintiff in relation to the 1st defendant’s application to the Court of Final Appeal for leave to appeal which the plaintiff will not be able to recover from the
1st defendant, subject to a cap of HK$150,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the plaintiff’s costs, for the purpose this indemnity vis-à-vis the 5th defendant, are to be assessed on a common fund basis (see Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2) [1975] 1 QB 373, at 391-392 per Lord Denning MR and at 403 per Buckley LJ). 29.  Save as mentioned in paragraph 28 above, the plaintiff’s Summons is dismissed. 30.  On the question of costs, the 5th defendant is, in substance, the successful party (including the argument in relation to the Leave Indemnity).  The Court of Appeal
accepted the 5th defendant’s argument that the plaintiff’s pervious application for interim payment could not be regarded as an application made
for the benefit of the 5th defendant, and thus the plaintiff was not entitled to any indemnity by the 5th defendant for the costs of that application: see the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in CACV 142/2015 (17 February 2016), at paragraphs
28 and 29.  I consider the present application to be substantially of the same nature, and I see no reason why the plaintiff should
not have to pay the 5th defendant’s costs of resisting the Summons.  I make an order that the plaintiff shall pay the 5th defendant’s costs of and occasioned by the Summons, including the costs of the hearing on 7 February 2017, to be taxed on a party

context of the age of the 1st defendant, and secondly in the context of the length of time over which these proceedings have been running.  I have no doubt that
this application is to be considered a ""late"" application in the context of proceedings which have been on foot for 10 years even
though no trial date is imminent. 21.  Perhaps most importantly however it seems to me is the fact that the 1st defendant will, through no fault of her own, it appears, be unable to respond to these new allegations, or to give proper instructions
for the pleading of a defence to them.  This is a prejudice which cannot be compensated for costs. 22.  For these reasons, I disagree with the view taken by the Master, and do not agree that leave should be given for the proposed amendments.
 In those circumstances I allowed the appeal, with costs of the appeal, and below, to the 1st defendant.",(Anthony Houghton SC)Recorder of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/669.html,"

HARBOUR FRONT LTD v. MONEY FACTS LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 201; HCCW 116/2015 (14 February 2017),"10.  The Petitioner’s last objection concerns UDL, which it says, correctly, has made an offer to rent the Property and provide a materially
greater deposit than GSL.  This I can deal with very shortly.  As I have mentioned UDL has previously been a tenant of the Property.
 It was the way in which YT Leung dealt with problems that arose with UDL’s occupancy that were amongst the reasons why Kwan J
determined the previous petitions against Harbour Front.  It seems to me perfectly reasonable in the circumstances for the Company
not to wish to let the Property to UDL when there is another party willing to do so. 11.  I will, therefore validate the new lease to GSL. 12.  So far as the second item is concerned, namely, the retainer for Savills.  In principle I am prepared to validate this subject to
the following qualifications.  The retainer is to be limited to advising on the pricing of the Property, the best methods of marketing
it for sale and the preparation of material for marketing the Property.  An agreement should be prepared and submitted for the court’s
approval.  Alternatively the matter can be stood over until the hearing of the Petitioner’s application for the appointment of

HEUNG WING YAN v. HANGWAY HOUSING MANAGEMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 207; HCPI 347/2012 (14 February 2017),"28.  As regards the 1st to 6th Letters and other indications to P to drop her claim against D1, it has to be something more than merely non‑acceptance of offer(s)
before it is appropriate to make an order for indemnity costs. Whilst it is possible that an unreasonable failure to accept an offer
for settlement or an unreasonable resistance to a sensible approach to finding a solution for the proceedings may attract indemnity
case, it has been described as “a rare case indeed” (see paragraph 19 above). Often hindsight might show it was unreasonable
or imprudent not to accept a better offer, but that will not normally be sufficient for an award of indemnity costs. 29.  In my view, the dismissal of P’s claim against D1 would not as a matter of course attract costs on indemnity basis. P’s claim
against D could not be said to have been commenced or prosecuted in such a manner as to constitute to an affront to the court. I
do not accept the circumstances of the present action were so insufficient as to put it outside ordinary hostile litigation, or cause
the court to feel a proper sense of indignation at P’s conduct that arose out of concern over eventual recovery of her entitlement
to compensation for personal injuries. P’s claim against D1 was a far cry from having knowingly put forward a false case from the
start. With hindsight the 1st to 6th Letters as well as the letter dated 19 September 2012 by D2’s solicitors that Mr Lim relied on were sensible offers that ought
to have been seriously considered or even accepted, but P had some basis for her claim against D1, albeit somewhat weak and thin,
and her rejection of such proposals was not so unreasonable as to be in that “rare” category of case that justified an award
of indemnity costs. 30.  In the circumstances, the Summons is dismissed, and the Cost Order Nisi is made absolute. There is no reason why costs should not
follow event. I grant a cost order nisi that D1 should pay P costs of the Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed on party-and-party basis,
and P’s own costs be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations.","24 March 2015

                By such open letter, D1 maintained its denial of liability, and noted P still failed to withdraw her claim against
D1. “[D1’s solicitors] are instructed to make a final offer to [P] to discontinue her common law claim against [D1] and pay the

is acceptable to her within the next 7 days, i.e. on or before 31 March 2015, failing which [D1’s] offer herein will lapse automatically.
Please note that [D1’s] estimated costs for the trial alone are not less than HK$300,000.00. [D1] shall seek costs against [P]

                “Take notice that [D1] hereby offers to consent to [P] discontinuing her common law claim against [D1] on the condition
that [P] shall pay the costs and disbursements as incurred by [D1] up to the date of acceptance of this sanctioned offer on a party-to-party
basis, pursuant to Order 22 of the RHC (“the Sanctioned Offer”). Please note that:-
                1. The Sanctioned Offer is intended to have the consequences of Order 22 of the RHC.
                2.  After the expiry of 28 days from the date the Sanctioned Offer is made, [P] may only accept it if (a) the parties
agree on the liability for costs; or (b) the Court grants leave to accept it.
                [D1’s solicitors] shall seek all costs against [P] on an indemnity basis (rather than on a party-to-party basis
and enhanced interest) if she fails to establish liability against [D1] at the end of the day. [D1] reserves its right to produce
a copy of this letter and all relevant correspondences should the issue of indemnity costs against [P] arise.

dates should be avoided if at all possible.  The prejudice to the defendant will not be fully compensated by payment of costs, even
on an indemnity basis.  They have waited for long for the trial to come on.  It would be an extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs
if having declined the plaintiff leave to amend, the plaintiff is nonetheless at full rein to run the same point without pleading
it.  The same surprise and prejudice would visit upon the defendant.  34.  Accordingly, I hold that the plaintiff is debarred from running the constructive trust issue during the trial or at closing submissions. 35.

the costs of the hearing on 12 January and 8 February 2017, with certificate for 2 counsel.  45.  The court expects the parties to act reasonably and sensibly after access is given to the Defendant for inspection of the documents,

and reasonable co-operation. In the event that the parties should have to appear in court to argue any further orders to be made

are entitled to conduct other forms of identification in order to address this issue.  This includes carrying out a photograph identification
session.  9.  Mr Kwok also argues that the prejudicial effect of the photograph identification evidence outweighs its probative value to such
an extent that it will infringe his right to a fair trial.  I see no basis for objection to the obtaining of this evidence and reliance

REYES JORNALYN MAY TABUNAR v. YAN KAM WAH AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 222; HCLA 45/2015 (16 February 2017),"52.  As D2 stated in her proposed ground of appeal, she waited until the PO granted the 2nd Award after trial, and then “本人覺得應該是可追討一個月代通知金權利” and raised such claim only in her Review
Application. Plainly, what D2 did was to rest her case on her assertion that she was not C’s employer, and it was only on adverse
finding by the PO that she was C’s actual employer that she made an about face to claim for wages in lieu of notice on the premise
that she was C’s employer. As the Other PO explained, D2 could have raised such counterclaim in LBTC1461/2014 on a primary or alternative
basis, but D2 chose not to do so until the PO made adverse findings against her. 53.  In my view, the PO was correct not to entertain such counterclaim at the Review Application as it was an abuse of process. The applicable
law is well settled. Where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court/tribunal, it behoved
the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and the same parties should not be permitted to open the same subject
of litigation in respect of the same matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest.[9] Here, the abuse lied in the fact D2 kept her counterclaim up her sleeve, and waited until the tides turned against her (ie she was
found to be C’s actual employer) before springing the counterclaim at the Review Application to vex C again even though she must
have known all along it was a potential counterclaim if she was found to be C’s employer (see D1’s counterclaim against C). There
was also the Other Claim and observation by the Other PO discussed above. In considering and balancing competing interests and factors
herein, the PO was correct in not giving consideration to such counterclaim at the Review Application. 54.  There are no merits to D2’s intended grounds of appeal. In the circumstances, D2’s Leave Application is dismissed with no order
as to costs. Should D2 require translation of this Judgment into punti language, she can contact my clerk to arrange an appointment
for a court interpreter to verbally translate this Judgment to her at the High Court Building at a mutually convenient time.",Date of Handing Down Judgment: 16 February 2017(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/222.html,"

HKSAR v. TSZ KA HIN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 315; HCCC 14/2016 (16 February 2017),"24.  The three robberies were carried out by the two defendants in concert and with the understanding that each would play a particular
role.  They bear equal culpability for each of the robberies.  The only mitigating factor that can be taken into account on their
behalf are their pleas of guilty for which they are entitled to a one-third discount, and to some extent their relatively young age
but which in the end deserves little if any weight because of the serious nature and multiplicity of the offences.  25.  On Count 1, I reduce the starting point of 6 years’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years’ imprisonment.  On Count 2, I reduce
the starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  On Count 3, I reduce the starting
point of 6 years and 6 moths’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.  26.  The fact that the defendants were involved in three robberies has been taken into account by me when addressing the totality principle.
 I therefore order that the sentence on Count 1 to be served concurrently to the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 and that the sentence
on Count 3 run partially consecutive to the sentence on Count 2 as to 4 months.  Thus resulting in each defendant serving a sentence
of 5 years’ imprisonment. ",Dates of Hearing: 13 and 16 February 2017Date of Sentence: 16 February 2017,(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/315.html,"

RE KWOK HIU CHUN DAMIEN [2017] HKCFI 660; HCB 5440/2012 (16 February 2017),"14.  The 2nd and 3rd grounds are related.  In short, it is argued that the LSP constituted accrued benefits or vested benefits which were protected under
s.16 of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, Cap 485, and was excluded from the Estate.  Further, the set off exercised by the Bankrupt’s ex-employer in respect of the accrued/vested
benefits against the LSP could not change the nature of that payment.  15.  I believe that there is a reasonable prospect of success in these grounds.  The relevant statutory provisions are complex.  On the
authorities before the court, these issues have not been examined by the court.  Hence, any view taken by the Bankrupt’s ex-employer
or the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority is, with respect, not beyond argument.  I should also mention that the point is
of some importance to the general public.  16.  For these reasons, I grant the relief sought in the Summons filed on 17 November 2016 with a costs order nisi that the costs of
and occasioned by the Summons be in the cause of the appeal. ","Date of Decision: 16 February 2017(Anthony Chan)

HKSAR v. PANG CHI-YIP [2017] HKCFI 231; HCCC 450/2016 (17 February 2017),"8.  The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 revised the sentencing tariffs for a person convicted of trafficking of Ice as contained in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125.  The new tariffs apply in this case.  The narcotic content of Ice of 12.52 g falls within the band of 10 to 70 g where the sentence
after trial ranges from 7 to 11 years’ imprisonment.  I will adopt for this quantity of drugs, a starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment
which I discount by one-third for his plea at the earliest opportunity to 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  In relation to the
possession offence, I adopt a starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment which I also discount by one-third to 8 months’ imprisonment.
 9.  Taking into account the totality principle and the circumstances of the defendant, I order that the sentence for the possession
offence run concurrently to the sentence for the trafficking offence.  I have borne in mind that the drugs found in the defendant’s
possession, had they been included in the trafficking offence would not have made a marked difference to the sentence that I have
imposed. 10.  Accordingly, the defendant will serve a sentence of 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Dates of Hearing:

For the above reasons, it is only fair for the Respondent to withhold interim distribution to all the beneficiaries including herself
pending the final determination of the claims against the Applicants or at least the provision of explanations and supporting documents
relating to the substantial transfers.  Using the words of Swinfen Eady J in Re Rhodesia Goldfields Limited, it would be a “strange travesty of equity” to allow the Applicants to be paid out of the Estate only “subsequently to find after it had been established that [they] owed money to the fund, that the amount could not be recovered from
[them].” 69.  Despite my ruling above, I have to emphasise that interim distribution application is a time-sensitive application.  The existing
justification in not making interim distribution may no longer be valid if there is any material change in circumstances, for example,
the Applicants are able to provide credible explanations for the making of the substantial transfers.  Hence, there should be liberty
to the Applicants to make a fresh application in appropriate circumstances. 70.  I understand that the parties have reserved their position on costs.  Since this case relates to the administration of a deceased’s
estate, the question of costs may not be a straightforward matter. I therefore give liberty to the parties to restore the hearing
for argument on costs.  If they consider that the question of costs is simple enough to be dealt with on paper, they should try to

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. YEUNG CHUNG LUNG AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 249; HCMP 205/2013 (17 February 2017),"116.  I have some sympathy for the Company.  However, it must not be forgotten the Company is the same legal entity as that which existed
when the matters which were the subject of the petition occurred.  The fact the Company may now have different shareholders and directors
does not detract from the fact that the Company was originally a rightful party to the petition and that the SFC was compelled to
bring the petition because the affairs of the Company were misconducted by some of its previous directors. 117.  I think in the circumstances of this case it would not be right to order that the SFC pay any part of the Company’s costs, particularly
as I do not think the Company’s costs of attendance on the petition hearing alone will be substantial.  However, I should caution
that the SFC should not assume the court will come to the same conclusion in future cases and real thought should be given as to
whether it is necessary for a company to attend on the hearing of the petition when that company has made its position clear in affidavit
evidence both as to the stance it is taking on the petition and in providing to the court all material information. 118.  In summary, I therefore made the following orders:","Net assets

than an abuse.  The fact that an oral application for costs have been made was irrelevant.  The procedure for variation is to precisely
deal with any matters overlooked by counsel or the court when making the costs order nisi.  Moreover, lawyers are used to dealing with multi-issues and there is no room for them to say that they have been distracted by
the opponent’s unwarranted interlocutory applications and failed to make a proper application. 15.  Ground (vii) has no merits.  It was another exercise of discretion based on the lengthy delay. 16.

because the defendants sought time to file evidence and costs were therefore thrown away.  This was not in the intended grounds of
appeal set out in the plaintiff's 5th affirmation.  In any event, as I read Chung  J's judgment, his Lordship adjourned the hearing because it was then only shortly after
the plaintiff had issued her summons and, given the features set out in his decision at §6, the defendants should in his view be
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.  I do not accept there are grounds to suggest I was plainly wrong in not making a separate
order in the plaintiff's favour for the costs of that hearing. 7.  Finally, I should not leave unanswered the serious allegation the plaintiff made on affirmation that this court had put pressure
on her and discriminated against her because she was a barrister. I reject the suggestion that by expressing some provisional views
formed upon reading the written materials, this court could be in anyway interpreted as putting pressure on the plaintiff.  Nor did
this court discriminate against the plaintiff.  I do however say that I was disappointed that the plaintiff, despite being a barrister
and despite she was asking for costs to be awarded to her at her professional charge out rate, had not complied with practice directions
requiring the preparation of paginated hearing bundles (and that regrettably applies also to this application for leave to appeal).
 That had made this court's preparation for the hearing and references to the evidence during the hearing unnecessarily difficult
and time-consuming, though this did not enter into my consideration of the outcome on costs. 8.  As is well established, costs is a matter in the general discretion of the court.  I do not think the plaintiff has begun to show
any ground for impugning the exercise of discretion.  I do not consider the proposed appeal to have any prospect of success.  Accordingly,
this application for leave to appeal must be dismissed.  No order is made as to the costs of this application since the defendants

sought a 30 day adjournment which the petitioning creditor did not oppose.  Counsel produced a signed (but yet to be notarized) affirmation
of Pradeep Phulchand Agarwal a director of the Company reporting on the status of the negotiations and seeking a 14 day adjournment. 9.  Mr Lok counsel for the petitioning creditor was not in a position to confirm the contents of that affirmation.  Suffice it to say
that its contents show that seemingly insuperable obstacles lie in the way of any settlement.   10.  The petition was filed in May 2016.  The parties have had ample time to negotiate.  There is nothing to suggest that the grant of
a further adjournment of 14 days the deponent requested would serve any useful purpose.  In those circumstances a winding up order
was the inevitable outcome.",Date of Handing Down Reasons for Judgment: 20 February 2017(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/661.html,"

other and with the sentences on Counts 3 and 4, and the sentence on Count 3 is to run partially consecutively as to 1 year with the
sentence on Count 4, thus resulting in a sentence to be served by the defendant of 7 years’ imprisonment.   45.  When taking a global approach in relation to the case, the same sentence would result.  The amount involved is over $22 million
but I have taken into account that about $15 million was the result of his conduct in relation to Count 4.  On this basis, a starting
point between the range of 10 and 11 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate.  I would adopt a starting point of 10 years and
6 months’ imprisonment which would be reduced by one third for the guilty pleas to 7 years’ imprisonment.  46.  The defendant is sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of 7 years.","Dates of Hearing:

Mr Wong drew to my attention the decision of Mr Justice Anthony Chan in Green Valley Investment Limited [1] in which the judge took the view that the application had been wrongly opposed.  The judge, however, made an order that: 9.  With respect to the learned Judge, it seems to me that an order in these terms contains an inherent contradiction: if there is justification
for ordering costs on an indemnity basis, it suggests that the costs should be paid by the company, or possibly, the directors regardless
of the outcome of the intended derivative proceedings.  If the company or directors avoid liability for costs in the event that they
successfully defend the action, it suggests that their opposition to the application was not entirely unjustified and calls into
question ordering that they pay costs on an indemnity basis.  10.  This serves to illustrate what in my respectful view is the better approach, which is in cases where it is suggested that the application
has been in some way improperly contested, that costs are reserved until either the derivative action is determined or the matter
is otherwise disposed of.","Date of Decision: 22 February 2017(Jonathan Harris)

I am satisfied therefore that the court should order the petitioner to give security for the 1st respondent’s costs.  The quantum of security is in the court’s discretion.  The aim is not necessarily for perfect security.
 The respondents estimated their costs eventually to be in the sum of HK$2,856,000 including the fees of two counsel for the trial.
 Taking into account all the circumstances including the nature of the issues and evidence to be adduced and the timing of this application,
I think it would be just to order security in the sum of HK$1.15 million. 15.  I will order that the 2nd respondent’s application be dismissed with costs to the petitioner and that the petitioner do pay the costs of the 1st respondent of and relating to the application.

that all the arguments of the Bankrupt, including the authority of Leung Kam Wah v Fung Yuk Ching, HCLA 43/2006, 23 April 2008, were considered by the learned Judge, and I have no reason to disagree with the OR in respect of the
merits of the Proceedings. 7.  As regards the issue of costs, the Bankrupt maintains that there is no costs issue in the Proceedings and that he would provide
a costs indemnity if the matters go to appeal.  I agree with the OR that the Bankrupt is wrong in that: (a) costs may be awarded
by the Tribunal pursuant to s.28 of the Labour Tribunal Ordinance, Cap 25; and (b) once the OR gives consent to the Proceedings, she would be exposed to costs and the promise to provide an indemnity
if the matters go on appeal is no answer to such exposure. 8.  In the premises, there is no reason to interfere with the decision in question, and I dismiss the Bankrupt’s Summons dated 17

 I should mention that I would not, in any event, order the 5th defendant to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of the costs of their summonses dated 14 December 2016 and 15 December 2016 respectively,
because (i) the plaintiff has been largely unsuccessful in those applications (save in respect of the basis of assessment of the
costs to be paid by the 1st defendant and the 5th defendant[1]), and (ii) the application for indemnity cannot be regarded as an application made for the benefit of the 5th defendant. 27.  The 1st defendant has been successful in resisting the variations sought by the plaintiff and the 5th defendant in so far as he might be affected by them. I consider that his costs should be borne by the plaintiff and the 5th defendant, to be assessed on a party and party basis, if not agreed, and I so order. 28.

U v. A AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 398; HCCT 34/2016 (23 February 2017),"81.  In substance, the November Summons seeks a further order to be made, specifying in clear terms that the relevant acts to be performed
by the 1st and 3rd Respondents under the Order should be carried out within a specified time.  It does not by itself seek to compel the performance
of the Order.  I do not agree that the November Summons is in substance enforcement of the Award.  Breach and non-compliance with
a court order is a serious matter and should be clearly established.  I am not satisfied that the November Summons constitutes breach
of the terms of the Consent Order. 82.  The Respondents’ application to strike out the November Summons is dismissed, with costs to U. 83.  Upon considering the November Summons, I grant an order in terms of that application, with costs in the cause of HCCT 34/2016.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/398.html,"

As to sentence, the Magistrate said this in paragraphs 30 to 32 of his Statement of Findings and Reasons for Sentence: 12.  The sentence which the Magistrate passed is an appropriate one to pass unless there is some reason to depart from the guidelines
to which he referred.  There is no such reason and therefore no basis on which to interfere with the sentence. 13.  In the result, both the appeal against conviction and the appeal against sentence are dismissed. ","andBISWAS SUBHASH

police officers whose duties include carrying out surveillance.  As I understand the case, the police officers concerned are in fact
giving evidence in relation to the surveillance they conducted on the defendants. 4.  I do not think the principle of open justice is in any way materially offended as everyone in the courtroom, other than members
of the public, will be able to see the police officers give evidence, and everyone in the courtroom will be able to hear their evidence.
 The jury will be appropriately directed to ensure that they do not view the arrangement in any way adversely to the defendants.

her anonymity is therefore required in order to perform such future duties.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2391.html,"

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2392; HCCC 41/2016 (23 February 2017),"15.  In light of recent authority, an expert witness is able to give his opinion on an ultimate issue in criminal proceedings, so long
as that opinion is within the area of the expert witness’s expertise and the judge makes it clear to the jury that they are not
bound by the expert’s opinion, and that the issue is for them to decide.  16.  I should add, however, that this will depend on the particular circumstances of the case, but primarily on the nature and necessity
of the expert evidence, and the nature and contentiousness of the ultimate issue concerned.  I should also reiterate that, a critical
factor is that the opinion evidence is a matter within the field and knowledge of the expert.  As observed by Gleeson NPJ in Fu Kor Kuen Patrick v HKSAR [2012] HKCFA 39;  (2012) 15 HKCFAR 524 at paragraph 51: 17.

to be visited with the costs of the Next Friend Application, the need for which cannot in any way be attributed to the plaintiff. 20.  On the other hand, while the Next Friend Application was not a matter on which the plaintiff should have had no say and the matters
raised in the B&M Letter were not entirely invalid, I find the plaintiff’s stance of formally not opposing the application
and then turning up with both leading and junior counsel to effectively oppose the application at the hearing to be disingenuous.
 I would have been sufficiently assisted by the B&M Letter. 21.  In the circumstances, I am prepared to order the 1st defendant to pay the plaintiff only the costs of the B&M Letter to be assessed summarily.  The plaintiff should file and serve
a statement of costs within 14 days.  The 1st defendant should file and serve a statement of objections (if any) within 14 days thereafter.  The plaintiff should have 14 days

FINANCIAL HOLDINGS (BVI) LTD v. CHAD C. HOLM AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 298; HCA 2545/2016 (24 February 2017),"34.  I now turn to consider the Plaintiff’s costs.  As the correspondence above shows, the Plaintiff has always been asking for $800
costs only which has been agreed to by the 2nd Defendant.  The fact that the Plaintiff is not asking for anything more than $800 in this application means that the Plaintiff is
not asking for any costs in relation to the application by summons and the hearing on 16 February 2017.  In these circumstances,
even though I have rejected Mr. Leung’s submissions on the legal requirement of an application for unless order, I think it is
fair if the Plaintiff is awarded with the costs of $800 which is the usual rate for an application of this sort.  After all, the
Plaintiff is the party which has been affected by the 2nd Defendant’s seeking of indulgence.  35.  By reasons of the aforesaid, I order that the 2nd Defendant do have time extension up to 6 March 2017 to file and serve his Defence and Counterclaim. 36.  There should also be an order nisi that the costs of this application be to the Plaintiff summarily assessed at $800 payable by the 2nd Defendant.

to be taken into account together with all the other factors relevant to their applications. The defendants have been in custody
since 14 June 2015 and as a result of the case now being adjourned to September of this year, it will mean that they would have been

HKSAR v. KRUGER PAUL ANTHONY [2017] HKCFI 304; HCMA 165/2016 (27 February 2017),"82.  In my judgment, it was against the aforesaid inherent probabilities of the defence case, the inherent improbabilities of the prosecution
case and the conduct of the trial that made Litton NPJ said what he said at paragraph 51 of the judgment in Raymond Chen.  The passage
from Litton NPJ’s judgment does not suggest that if the appellate court concludes that the Magistrate has misdirected himself on
the law or applied the law erroneously and that what he has done constitutes a material irregularity then the appeal must be allowed.
 In my judgment, in the present case, there was little dispute as to what happened, the evidence as to how the accident happened
all came from the appellant. There is no reason why the appellate court, having found that the learned Magistrate had misdirected
him on the law, should not apply the correct principles of law as part of the rehearing process and assess the evidence.  In my judgment,
the error by the learned Magistrate should not lead to the appeal being allowed and the conviction quashed.  As McWalters J (as he
then was) said in Ip Chin Kei, the test in determining whether an error by the Magistrate should lead to an appeal being allowed and the conviction quashed is
whether it is just for such an order to be made.  In the present case, the answer is clearly “No”, it is no just to allow the
appeal because of the error made by the learned Magistrate. 83.  On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the only reasonable action by the appellant in the circumstances was to apply the emergency
brakes.  By steering the bicycle to the right, the appellant went so close behind the lady.  The appellant had clearly failed to
take into account the shock reactions of the lady when she realized the presence of the appellant and his bicycle at the last moment.
 I agree with the respondent’s submissions that the appellant was clearly taking unnecessary risks by steering his bicycle to the
right.  In my judgment, the appellant was not exercising that decree of care and attention that a reasonable and prudent and prudent
driver would exercise in the circumstances.  On a re-hearing, looking at the evidence adduced before the learned Magistrate I am
satisfied that on the evidence the guilt of the appellant has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. 84.  For the reasons given, I dismiss the appellant’s appeal against conviction.",Date of Hearing: 14 September 2016Date of Judgment: 27 February 2017,"(Johnny Chan)

against D1 and the world at large. 41.  In the circumstances, I find P had established factual possession over the Property for not less than 12 years before the commencement
of the present proceedings. I am also persuaded P and his family/helpers had occupied and used the Property exclusively since 1995,
and since then he had the requisite intention to adversely possess the Property. Hence P had established possessory title over the

of 11 years.   33.  As for her contribution to the campaign, which is treated as positive good character for the purpose of sentence, I am of the view
that a further discount of 6 months would be appropriate.  I am aware that the discount by some judges in the High Court is almost comparable in terms of percentage
given to those who rendered assistance to law enforcement authorities.  I am of the view that in the absence of evidence of positive
tangible result (as in the case of this defendant), the discount should not be comparable to actual assistance given to authorities.

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2394; HCCC 41/2016 (28 February 2017),"38.  The suggestion of replacing the references to the defendants in the 5th defendant’s statements with a letter of the alphabet is neither appropriate nor practical.  The prosecution case against the 5th defendant is based on his admissions about his dealings with the other defendants as alleged in the conspiracy count.  It will only
confuse the jury as why the persons are referred to by an alphabetical letter when it is alleged that he and the other defendants
conspired together to make explosives, in the form of smoke bombs.  The prosecution case also relies on surveillance evidence where
it is alleged that they meet and gathered together on the occasions the 5th defendant describes in his statements.  I should add that the 5th defendant’s out of court statements is admissible evidence only against the 5th defendant, and this will be made clear to the jury.  39.  In my view, the issue of the 5th defendant’s admissions in his out of court statements can be fairly and properly dealt with by giving full and proper directions
to the jury. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, I refuse the application and the defendants will face trial together on the five counts as contained
in the indictment. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2394.html,"

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2395; HCCC 41/2016 (28 February 2017),"37.  I dismiss the application as it seems clear to me that on an appraisal of the contents of the articles, and the discussions on the
social mediums, by reference to when and how they occurred, and the scale of their audience or participants, that the passage of
time will mitigate against any serious or lasting prejudice.  But the principal basis for dismissing this application is the courts’
faith in the jury system, and that there is good reason in regarding the jury, properly directed, to be able to overcome prejudicial
publicity in the vast majority of cases.  In my opinion, a jury properly directed can overcome the issue of any adverse publicity
as claimed to have occurred in the present case.  I should also add that the case has been adjourned for the trial to take place
in September 2017 and therefore any recollection that a juror may have of the adverse publicity can be expected to fade considerably,
if not totally.  38.  For the foregoing reasons, I do not consider to the requisite standard that the risk of prejudice is so grave that no direction
from the Court could reasonably be expected to remove it. 39.  To ensure that the jury is properly directed, I attach a proposed direction that I will give to the jury panel and which, with appropriate
changes or amendments, will be repeated throughout the trial. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2395.html,"

nature of the case that the prosecution seek to prove; the principal overt acts from which the prosecution invite the jury to infer
that there was an agreement as alleged; and that a particular defendant was a party to the agreement. It is fundamental that particulars
addressing the essential element of the conspiracy to be proved need to be clear and precise, whereas the overt acts from which the
jury is invited to infer the existence of an agreement will depend upon the evidence presented during the trial.  However, any change
of the case should not disadvantage or prejudice a defendant in the conduct of his defence so as to deprive him of a fair trial.
  8.  In the present case, the prosecution is to provide the defence particulars specifying, the nature and object of the conspiratorial
agreement, including the nature and quantity of the explosive substance(s) that the prosecution allege was the object of the conspiratorial
agreement; the principal overt acts the prosecution allege that infer the conspiratorial agreement; and the case the prosecution
seek to prove that a particular defendant was a party to the conspiratorial agreement.  9.  The prosecution is also to provide the defence particulars specifying the nature and quantity of the explosive substance(s) the

SKYRUN LIGHT INDUSTRY (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. SWIFT RESOURCES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 332; HCA 1278/2014 (1 March 2017),"59.  Mr Hui also said in his written submissions that there is a real risk that the trial dates will be jeopardised.  Though he said
the action was commenced on 8 July 2014, he acknowledged that this application was issued on 31st August 2016.  60.  He referred to Skyrun’s argument that the new case in the amendments is based on the same documentary evidence which has been
available to the defendants all along.  He, however, argued that Skyrun is seeking to plead a fundamentally different nature for
the 1st USD Agreement and the defendants have been taken by surprise.  He also envisaged that change of Skyrun’s case (which is somewhat
inconsistent with the originally pleaded case) will lead to substantial amendments on pleadings and witness statements by both parties.
 But he did not say what kind of amendment to pleadings or evidence will be introduced by the parties.  I say again that such generalized
and boastful complaints are useless.  There must be particulars and concrete particulars to make the complaints meaningful.  Furthermore,
in the light of my discussion on the merits of the amendments and in particular §§5 to 11 of the defence, this argument has no
merit. 61.  In the premises, I allowed the application.  I also order costs of the application and of and occasioned by the amendments be paid

setting a time limit of a week and giving fair warning of the likely order that would be sought if the proposal were to be rejected.
 The proposed costs order in the event of a withdrawal can only be described as generous from the petitioner’s perspective. 81.  Even assuming that the petitioner had been able to mount some sort of a prima facie case (which is not the present case), balance of convenience considerations would rule out any appointment in circumstances where
the petitioner is a foreign national with no apparent assets within the jurisdiction and who has not offered any undertaking as to
damages (much less fortification). 82.  Hopeless applications are not to be encouraged. They fly in the face of a litigant’s obligations under the CJR.  In the circumstances

into the plaintiff’s possession.  There are also, in my view, gaps in the plaintiff’s evidence as to when exactly and how exactly
the mortgage was created. 4.  In all the circumstances of this case, until the parties have been cross-examined at trial, I cannot say, on the state of the evidence
put before me, that the 1st defendant’s assertions are not capable of belief.  The question of whether the deeds were in fact deposited
by the 1st defendant with the plaintiff, and whether there was an agreement between them that the deeds were to be used as security for the debt
can only, in my view, be determined at trial after cross-examination. 5.  In all the circumstances of this case, including the fact that monetary judgment has already been given to the plaintiff, I consider
that the only proper order that I can give today is for unconditional leave to be given to the 1st defendant, and since I am granting

- which represented half his turnover - of $10,000-$20,000 a month.  That would have required him to buy and sell quite a number
of phones since the profit he claims to have made was only $100 or so on each phone, and yet there was virtually no sign of any phones
in his flat.  Indeed, when asked, a few weeks ago, what his employment history was for the purpose of preparing his antecedents,
he did not say that he bought and sold mobile phones. 11.  Nor do I believe that the defendant borrowed $30,000 from anyone.  He has not called Man Wang Ping as a witness, who is the friend
who he claims lent him the money, nor has he called his mother as a witness to confirm his understanding that she repaid $25,000
of that loan.  The defendant has produced a bank receipt which shows that $25,000 was paid into Man Wan Ping’s account in August
2014, but that could have related to just about anything.  Indeed, at no stage in the course of his trial was it suggested that the
cash found on him or in the bag represented what was left of a loan of $30,000. Moreover, the defendant acknowledged that no interest
was to be charged on the loan, and that no arrangements had been made for its repayment, save only that it was to be repaid when
the circumstances of his business allowed it.  In my opinion, his account is just too fanciful to be believed. 12.  In the circumstances, the defendant has not satisfied me that any of this cash was not received as a result of a drug trafficking
offence.  Indeed, I am sure that it was.  Section 56(1) confers a discretion on the court in those circumstances to make a forfeiture order, and I can discern no reason why a forfeiture
order should not be made.  Mr Donald did not suggest that, if I were to find the facts to be as the prosecution contended, this was
not a case for the making of a forfeiture order.  I therefore order that the cash be forfeited.",Date of Ruling:  1 March 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/504.html,"

LIU MING v. WOO CEONG HOI AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 810; HCCW 204/2016 (1 March 2017),"2.  The 2nd summons was issued by the 1st and 2nd respondents on 17 November 2016 seeking banking documents in respect of deposits referred to in paragraph 34 of the petition.  The
petitioner objects to discovery of those documents on the grounds that although the matter is raised by the petitioner in the petition,
discovery of the bank records might incriminate the petitioner.  The petitioner has filed an affirmation dealing with this.  3.  In a dialogue with the Court Mr Joshua Choy, who appeared for the petitioner, said that he understood that this position invited
the suggestion that the court should infer that the petitioner’s explanation for depositing money, which should have gone into
the Company’s bank account into his own bank account, was bogus.  The petitioner is apparently subject to police investigations
in respect of the payment.  In the circumstances, I proceed on the basis that the petitioner has demonstrated a real risk of incrimination
and will not order discovery.  4.  There was also a discussion as to how costs should be dealt with.  The petitioner arguing that the petitioner had brought his position
to the attention of the respondents by filing an affirmation and in without prejudice save as to costs correspondence.  Having looked

WONG MAN HON FREDERICK v. CHINA TIMES SECURITIES LTD [2017] HKCFI 343; HCA 2715/2016 (2 March 2017),"8.  Challenge is also made to the brief fees paid to counsel.  The brief fee for junior counsel for the hearing on 28 October 2016 was
$24,000 and for the hearing on 3 February 2017 $48,000.  The plaintiff says fair amounts would be $15,000 and $30,000 bearing in
mind Mr Wong was only called to the Bar in 2014.  Notwithstanding his relatively recent year of call the amounts claimed for Mr Wong’s
fees seem reasonable. 9.  Challenge is also made to Mr Manzoni’s brief fee of $300,000 and it is suggested this should be taxed down to $150,000.  Given
Mr Manzoni was briefed for the substantive hearing of the injunction and the fact this necessitated filing a skeleton argument as
well as attendance on the substantive hearing, I have taken account of the likely preparation time needed.  I have concluded a brief
fee of $225,000 is a fair one to recover on a party and party taxation. 10.  With the addition of manual items where I accept the plaintiff’s objections this arrives at a total figure of $444,138 and that

flexibility to deal with the issue of costs after looking at the result of the taxation proceedings.  Depending on the degree of
the taxing down of the Bills (if any), the arbitrator may take different view as to who should bear the costs of the Arbitration
proceedings.  Second, it may not be right for the Respondent to say that the only outstanding matter in the Arbitration proceedings
is costs.  If the Applicants still refuse to pay the taxed fees after taxation, the Respondent may still have to proceed with the
Arbitration to compel the Applicants to pay the taxed fees.  In my judgment, it would be more prudent for the parties to conclude
the Arbitration after the taxation proceedings.  Third, I understand that the parties will soon fix the dates for the taxation hearing,
and so it may be an exaggeration to say that the arbitrator would have to wait indefinitely for the result of the taxation of the
Bills.  For these reasons, I reject the Lifting of Stay Application. 30.  I make the following costs order nisi: 31.

LEE PO WING v. SEE WAH FAN [2017] HKCFI 376; HCMP 1771/2013 (7 March 2017),"35.  Mr Lee seeks summary assessment of his costs and has produced a costs statement in which he claims the following items of costs:- 36.  Mr Lee’s affirmation, of 34 pages long, contains, essentially, a list of the unsuccessful legal proceedings previously instituted
by Madam See. There is also a single exhibit to the affirmation consisting of a bundle, without any index, of 1,017 pages of previous
court documents.  If it is decided to include a number of documents in one exhibit, a proper index of the documents should be prepared.
 I pause to observe that the same bundle of 1,017 pages of documents was reproduced as part of the hearing bundles (in 3 volumes),
also without any index.  As mentioned in the course of the hearing, I consider the preparation of the hearing bundles in this manner
to be entirely unsatisfactory. 37.  In view of the fact, as I understand it to be the case, that Mr Lee was involved in most if not all of the previous legal proceedings
brought by Madam See, I consider the time spent by him in preparing the affirmation to be excessive.  I would allow 16 hours of work
for preparation of the affirmation.  I therefore summarily assess Mr Lee’s costs at HK$88,600 (HK$6,600 + HK$4,000 per hour x 20.5

It must be borne in mind that it is common ground that the land had been rented by him for many years before the Plaintiff became

of actions and proceedings.  There are already more than one derivative action commenced in the name of the Company.  In considering
this new application for leave to bring another derivative action, the court should be apprised of their status and position as part
of the overall circumstances. 4.  Further, apparently some of the derivative actions commenced in the name of the Company have come to a standstill because Mr Cheung,
as a litigant in person, has not been able to progress them.  It is a question that the court as well as the parties need to consider
whether further proceedings should be brought in the name of the Company unless it is shown that they will be pursued and serve a
purpose.  5.  I will therefore adjourn the Originating Summons sine die with liberty to restore.  That will also allow an opportunity for the technical matters raised by Mr Wong on behalf of the Company

"CITIBANK, N.A. v. YORK STAR CO LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 390; HCA 526/2016 (9 March 2017)","21.  The 5th defendant has signed guarantees with specific warnings as to the adviseability of independent legal advice.  It is of course well
known that the fact that a document has been signed by a party does not preclude that party from bringing forward evidence to show
that the signature was not evidence of informed consent or agreement on the part of the party signing.  It is equally trite however
that there is a substantial evidential burden placed on such a party: see for example The Hong Kong Chinese Bank, Ltd v Santa Fur Co Ltd (unreported; 4 October 1999, HCMP 266/1999 at paragraphs 9 – 11); and Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Leigh Hardwick (unreported; 28 August  2013, HCA 1110/2006) at paragraphs 20 – 26. 22.  In the present case the 5th defendant has provided no evidence on which the court could form a view that his signature of these documents represented anything
other than his informed consent to act as guarantor.  His explanation of the circumstances in which he came to sign is bereft of
any relevant detail, and nor is there any detail as to the actual involvement ofhis parents or the background leading up to the execution
of the guarantees.  There is no evidence given as to his personal circumstances upon which the court could form a view as to the
implication of any presumed influence exerted by his parents.  There is, on the other hand, evidence to suggest that the 5th defendant is an adult, actively engaged in business and, at one time at least, a director of the principal debtor, the 1st defendant.  Correspondingly, the weight to be attached to the presumption of undue influence that arises in a parent and child situation,
is low.  The evidential burden on the plaintiff to show that the 5th defendant was properly advised of the risks inherent in the guarantee was easily met by the plaintiff. 23.  In those circumstances the court concluded that the 5th defendant had not discharged the burden which lay upon him of showing triable issues, or other reasons for which this matter should
proceed to a trial.  The 5th defendant’s appeal against the decision of the Master was, accordingly, dismissed.  Costs were awarded to the plaintiff on an indemnity
basis, in accordance with the terms of the guarantee document.",Date of Decision: 21 February 2017Date of Reasons for Decision: 9 March 2017,"(Anthony Houghton SC)

this would significantly ameliorate any prejudice otherwise faced by the plaintiff pending a determination of the merits of its claim
and, in the circumstances, an appropriate order for costs would indeed largely compensate any residual prejudice. 12.  Accordingly, the 4th defendant’s application to set aside the default judgement was allowed, conditional upon the payment in by the 4th defendant of the sum of HK$466,500, plus interest in the sum of HK$10,000. 13.  I record that it was common ground between the parties that although the setting aside application strictly speaking addressed only
paragraph 2 of the order of Lam J dated 2 December 2016, the setting aside, together with the payment in by the 4th defendant carried with it the discharge of the Mareva injunction set out at paragraph 1 of that order.

a group of questions or the questions overall required me to review my rejection of the PSI claim.  I saw no reason for changing
my decision in whole or in part.  Where questions were not relevant to the cross-examination or sought to establish liability for
certain conduct, I have already disallowed them. 31.  I therefore dismissed D3’s claim for PSI but reserved costs.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/396.html,"

YAU SAU CHUN v. YAU TIM WO [2017] HKCFI 406; HCAP 9/2016 (10 March 2017),"27.  I should also deal with one other criticism of the plaintiff’s evidence raised by Mr Chan.  In paragraph 2(e) of the Defence and
Counterclaim, the defendant alleged that Mr Chung (Chairman of Tsuen Wan Rural Committee) advised the Deceased that the transfer
of the Property to the plaintiff could be done “by way of testamentary gift in order to save costs and to avoid the payment of
land premium to the Hong Kong Government”.  In paragraph 5 of her 2nd affirmation filed on 7 October 2016, the plaintiff said that she had never heard that “there was this Mr Chung Wai Ping who gave
any advice to [the Deceased] in August 2003” as alleged.  Mr Chan submits that this evidence of the plaintiff is rebutted by the
contents of the August 2003 Letter.  As I see it, the letter does not, in fact, give any clue on the advice (if any) given by Mr
Chung to the Deceased.  In any event, the comments in paragraph 26 above also apply to this criticism of the plaintiff’s evidence. 28.  Overall, I do not consider that the various matters raised by the defendant, whether taken individually or cumulatively, are sufficient
to raise any triable issue that the Deceased did not know or approve of the contents of the 2003 Will at the time of execution of
that document. 29.  For the above reasons, I give summary judgment for the plaintiff, and strike out the defendant’s counterclaim, in terms of paragraphs
1 and 2 of the plaintiff’s summons dated 7 October 2016.  I also make an order nisi that: (i) the defendant shall pay the plaintiff the costs of this action, including the costs of and occasioned by the summons, to
be taxed on a party and party basis if not agreed, with certificate for counsel, and (ii) the plaintiff’s costs, to be assessed

in the existing proceedings was the only proper course open to Madam Cheung.  I do not think that it was.  The existing proceedings were proceedings in which Madam Cheung’s
right to occupy the Flat could have been litigated, but I do not think that those proceedings had to be the forum in which that issue was to be litigated.  Apart from what I said in para 21 above about there having been no obligation
on her to declare her interest in the Flat earlier than she did, it is not as if the court had already determined whether she had
the right to occupy the Flat.  So there was no chance of inconsistent judgments in different proceedings, nor any question of there
being a multiplicity of proceedings, since Madam Cheung’s only reason for seeking to be joined in the existing proceedings is to
obtain a stay of the enforcement of the judgment in those proceedings.  In the circumstances, I do not see why Madam Cheung should
be prevented from having her right to occupy the Flat decided in the fresh proceedings she has issued. 34.  If Madam Cheung’s right to occupy the Flat is to be litigated in HCA 3104/2015, there has to be a stay of the execution of the
writ of possession in HCMP 1084/2008.  Otherwise any judgment in her favour in HCA 3104/2015 will be worthless.  In order to enable
her to apply for that stay, I grant her application to be joined as a party to HCMP 1084/2008.  I stay the execution of the writ
of possession in those proceedings.  That stay will continue until Madam Cheung’s claim in HCA 3104/2015 has been determined or
until further order in the meantime.  Yu Fung’s application to strike out the Statement of Claim in HCA 3104/2015 and for the action
to be dismissed is itself dismissed.  35.  At present, I see no reason why costs should not follow the event.  After all, Yu Fung could have agreed to Madam Cheung being joined
as a party to HCMP 1084/2008, and the order nisi which I make, therefore, is that Yu Fung must pay to Madam Cheung her costs of both summonses, to be taxed if not agreed, save that

YAU YIC LOCK v. WU TSANG KWAI YUK AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 418; HCMP 2272/2014 (10 March 2017),"23.  On 28 October 2016, this court granted leave to Ds to file and serve affirmation(s) in reply to Mr Hout’s 1st affidavit.  I do not think Ds had breached the order of 28 October 2016 by them each filing one affirmation.  In any event, the matter
should have rested there since in Mr Hout’s 1st affidavit, he had already said a pre-action letter was sent by registered and ordinary post to D1 and a copy of the letter was produced
by him; and he had also explained why there was no pre-action letter to D2. 24.  I do not see that any further affidavits/affirmations would have added anything to or detracted anything from the parties’ respective
arguments.  In particular, Mr Hout’s 3rd affidavit had no relevance to this application.  There were also numerous letters to the court which no doubt added to the parties’
respective costs and also resulted in delay in the matter.  In my view, it was also not necessary for P’s Counsel to lodge any
revised submissions. 25.  This is a simple application and Ds’ case was essentially based on those letters produced by D2 in his 5th affirmation and Mr Hout’s 1st affidavit.  I am therefore of the view that there should be no order as to costs after Ds’ reply affirmations were filed on 3 November

WONG MAN HON FREDERICK v. CHINA TIMES SECURITIES LTD [2017] HKCFI 432; HCA 2715/2016 (10 March 2017),"6.  Lastly, it is suggested there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether there is credible evidence that the shares have been
sold as alleged by the plaintiff.  As I pointed out in my judgment, there is in fact no direct evidence before the court as to the
sale of the shares.  The evidence is based upon assumptions that shares registered in the name of Standard Chartered Bank must belong
to certain individuals but these assumptions are unsupported by any corroborating evidence.  Indeed, the only direct evidence before
the court is to the effect the shares are still in the custody of the defendant’s custodian, Beaufort Securities Limited. 7.  Even if, however, there was anything in any of the above three grounds of appeal, the plaintiff is unable to overcome the fatal
obstacle to his case in respect of an injunction, namely that damages are clearly an adequate remedy.  There is simply no evidence
before the court to gainsay that damages would not be an adequate remedy and in such circumstances it is clear from all the authorities
that an injunction will not lie.  In such circumstances, I have no hesitation therefore in dismissing this application for leave
to appeal. 8.  I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of this application on a party and party basis such costs to be assessed
on a gross sum basis. The defendant do file its statement of costs within 7 days, and the plaintiff do file its list of objections

CHAN CHI LAM T/A HOI FAT CONSTRUCTION CO v. LAM WOO &AMP; CO LTD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 421; HCCT 52/2014 (13 March 2017),"57.  As for the submission made on behalf of Chan, that adverse inferences should be drawn against the JV for its failure to call Mr
Wong as its witness at trial, I accept the explanation given on behalf of the JV.  Mr Wong’s statement only deals with the disputed
items 6.8-6.14 of Appendix 1, which were not pursued at trial.  Further, as Counsel for the JV pointed out, the drawing of an adverse
inference is only appropriate when the opponent’s assertion and claim is credible.  The issues remaining in dispute at trial are
adequately clear without the need to call Mr Wong, and any adverse inference against the JV by reason of its failure to call Mr Wong
would not have assisted Chan’s case.  As the court rightly observed in Gleneagle Holdings Ltd v Tse Yue Fong & others HCA 2807/2006 12 May 2009, it would be unreasonable to draw an adverse inference against a party to give support to an assertion
which cannot even stand on its own, or is not established. 58.  In the light of the findings I have made on the assessment, parties should submit (within 7 days of the handing down of this judgment)

closing, and the amounts which I have found on the valuation, on the construction and incorporation of the Remeasurement Clause. 59.  Any submissions on costs (restricted to no more than 2 A4 pages for each party) should be made in writing within 7 days of the lodging

"HKSAR v. HOANG, THI HANG [2017] HKCFI 424; HCMA 607/2016 (13 March 2017)","13.  Is 8 months of charge 3 to be made consecutive to charge 2 excessive?  In deciding how many months to make consecutive requires
the Magistrate to ensure he avoids imposing a total sentence that is too severe and unjustified.  He should assess the overall criminal
criminality of the appellant’s crimes.  Here the magistrate made 8 months or about 50% consecutive.  Ms Ma for the respondent did
submit an authority, HKSAR v Mohomed Rahoof Mohomed Sajahan, HCMA 270/2014 to demonstrate the 15-month sentence after a plea is equally applicable to a defendant who uses a forged identity
card to prolong her stay here or hide her identity.  The respondent submits that sentence is equally applicable to the facts of charge
3 as it is to charge 2 where the appellant used it to obtain employment.  I agree with her submission but at the same time mindful
of the very different motive behind using a forged identity card in both instances. 14.  Although I do not find any fault in the individual sentences, I find the total sentence of 23 months on the high side when I take
into account the appellant’s criminality overall.  I am of the view that a sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment in this present
case will suffice to reflect the culpability of the appellant. 15.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that now 4 months of the 15-month sentence of charge 3 will be served consecutively to the 15‑month
sentence of charge 2.  The appellant is to serve a term of imprisonment reduced from 23 months to a total of 19 months.",Date of Hearing: 8 March 2017Date of Judgment: 13 March 2017,"(Amanda J Woodcock)

for the purpose of reducing any sentence of his on any previous occasion.  Mr Daryanani adopts a neutral stance on the question of
whether those 27 days should be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the sentence which the Appellant now appeals against. 16.  In all the circumstances, I consider it just to reduce the sentence by those 27 days. Without in any way faulting the Magistrate,
I allow this appeal to reduce the sentence by 27 days.  It appears that even if his sentence were not reduced, the Appellant would
have been released 10 days from today on the 23rd of this month.  If so, the result of this appeal is the Appellant’s immediate release. 17.  I conclude this judgment by expressing my thanks to Mr Daryanani for his very considerable assistance in this appeal and, I would

of his drink driving in the sense that a lower reading of alcohol might have been recorded. I also agree with the Magistrate that
the appellant’s leaving the scene made the investigation of the police more difficult.  It is entirely proper of the Magistrate

HKSAR v. PABITA RAUT [2017] HKCFI 434; HCMA 551/2016 (14 March 2017),"18.  The magistrate found on the evidence the appellant was working in the kitchen.  She was washing dishes in a staff-only area and
had on an apron and wellington boots to do the task.  Her personal belongings were stored in the staff-only area.  I am satisfied
from the evidence and papers that the sole and irresistible inference of employment can be drawn and the elements of this offence
can be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. 19.  In arriving at his sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for section 38AA offences.  Here, the appellant was convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence
of 22 months and 2 weeks is correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain
mitigating factors such as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here the appellant
did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm.  20.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellant.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and is

the parties to adduce all the evidence for the court to consider the strength of the evidence and to determine which parties has
a higher prospect of success or how high that is. It is wrong to do it this way. Accordingly, I would not consider this argument
advanced by Mr Chen. 39.  As I have pointed out above that it is wrong in principle for the defendant to apply for stay of proceedings of the present action,
I now dismiss the appeal. 40.  I make a costs order nisi that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff the costs of this appeal, and I will assess the amount of costs summarily. Solicitors

LIU HSIAO CHENG v. WONG SHU WAI AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 453; [2017] 2 HKLRD 580; [2017] 3 HKC 113; HCA 1278/2013 (17 March 2017),"39.  Mr Lam reminds the court that a pleading should not be struck out save in a plain and obvious situation.  I agree.  However, the
limitation point raised by Mr Wou is a short point of law.  Although it is by no means an easy one, I do not consider that any useful
purpose will be served by postponing its determination, there being no suggestion that further evidence may be adduced at the trial
which could be relevant to its proper resolution. 40.  For the above reasons, I hold that the claim for an account in paragraph 125 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, to the
extent that it relates to remittances made on or before 12 July 2007, is time-barred.  Since the parties have not addressed me on
the question of whether the striking out of the entries relating to remittances made on or before 12 July 2007 in Appendices A to
A-11 would or may have any impact on other pleas in the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, I shall leave it to the parties to agree
on the form of the order to give effect to this decision, with liberty to apply in the event of disagreement. 41.  The parties are agreed that the costs of the strike out application should follow the event. Accordingly, Wong shall pay Liu the
costs of and occasioned by the strike out summons dated 3 March 2017, to be assessed on a party and party basis if not agreed, with
certificate for counsel.  In view of the fact that the hearing on 9 March 2017 was originally fixed for the hearing of Liu’s Notice
of Appeal dated 11 August 2016 and there could be some issues regarding the proper apportionment of counsel’s brief fee for the
hearing, I shall postpone the assessment of the costs, which I intend to do summarily, to the next hearing when the Notice of Appeal
comes before me.",Date of Hearing: 9 March 2017Date of Decision: 17 March 2017,"(Anderson Chow)

extension of time, and dismiss the application for leave accordingly.  It is unnecessary to deal with the detailed points raised
on extension of time, except to record that I do not accept Mr Pun SC’s submission that any eligible resident who has just turned
18 and applied for PRH may bring the same application for judicial review within time for the “grounds for the application first
arose”[30] when he became 18.  It seems to me that quite different considerations may well apply in such a case because arguably the only relevant

that the Commission’s decision not to pay the gratuity was perverse or irrational.  In other words, I do not accept that the Tribunal’s

HKSAR v. GOLDEN FIELD GLASS WORKS CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 491; HCMA 358/2016 (22 March 2017),"17.  The appellant in this case was therefore convicted only under s 6(1) and 6(2)(a) of the above Ordinance.  In other words, the appellant
was convicted of failing to provide or maintain plant and systems of work that are so far as reasonably practicable safe and without
risks to health.  At the trial, the defence’s submission was that the charge against the appellant under the subsection (2)(a)
does not cover supervision because supervision is covered by another subsection namely, subsection (2)(c), the learned magistrate
found that the subsections (a) to (e) are not mutually exclusive and their supervision is part and parcel of the safe system of work,
which the appellant had failed to provide.  However, in the learned magistrate’s conclusion, in his Statement of Findings at para
46, it would appear that the learned magistrate was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to whether the failure of the appellant
was in not giving “direct and clear instructions to PW2” or that the appellant did not supervise properly the workers on the
site or that the appellant had failed to make any risk assessment on the site.  Further, it would appear from the learned magistrate’s
conclusion, he considered that as any of those scenarios would make the appellant guilty of failing to ensure the safety and health
at work of PW2 he convicted the appellant. 18.  I agree with Mr Hui that it is incumbent on the learned magistrate to be satisfied beyond the reasonable doubt on the actual basis
of guilt of the appellant in a criminal trial and using the words “further or alternatively” leads one to conclude that the learned
magistrate was not sure as to upon what basis he convicted the appellant and therefore there is a material irregularity and it is
not fair to the appellant.  The conviction is therefore unsafe and unsatisfactory. 19.  So in the light of the above conclusion, even if the appellant failed on the other grounds of appeal, this ground of appeal having
succeeded would by itself render any conviction unsafe, therefore, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence set aside.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/491.html,"

In opposing the Defendant’s request for them to pay for the costs of the second hearing, the Plaintiffs submit that: (i) most
of the amendments proposed by the Plaintiffs had in fact been approved in the second hearing, in particular those relating to the
claims for unjust enrichment; and (ii) the Defendant had not made any attempt to resolve or narrow the dispute between the parties
before the second hearing.  Further, the Plaintiffs argue that both hearings have assisted the future conduct of the present Consolidated
Action and the other related proceedings, and so the costs of both hearings should at least be costs in the cause. 21.  I disagree.  The Defendant had specified its concern clearly in the correspondence.  The Plaintiffs finally acknowledged such concern
by agreeing to make further revisions to the drafts in the second hearing.  I also take the view that the reference to the Other
Transactions had all along been the main dispute between the parties, and the other amendments, for example those relating to the

the proper defendant to proceedings such as the present should be the Government.  In cases concerning bona vacantia the Registrar of Companies has been given authority to act on behalf of the Government.  See eg Yang Zhenghong v Registrar of Companies (unreported) HCMP 3115/2003 (23 November 2015) at §5.  Alternatively, an application may be made under section 765 of the CO for
the restoration of a dissolved company to the Companies Register, with the effect that it is to be regarded as having continued in
existence as if it had not been dissolved (section 768).  However, the present circumstances may not warrant the time and costs of
such a course. 19.  In any event, the proceedings in their present form are improperly constituted.  Mr Yip invited the Court to give leave to amend
the Originating Summons to substitute the name of the defendant with the Companies Registrar.  As there was no proper application
before me to do so, and given that the Originating Summons has not been served, my view is that it would be preferable for the plaintiff
to start afresh.  Indeed, Mr Yip was unable to point to any prejudice that the plaintiff would suffer if he were to commence fresh
proceedings. 20.  In the circumstances, I dismissed the originating summons with no orders as to costs.",Before: Deputy High Court Judge Douglas Lam SC in Chambers,"(Douglas Lam SC)

of the amendments proposed by the Plaintiffs had in fact been approved in the second hearing, in particular those relating to the

HKSAR v. CHEUNG KAM YAU [2017] HKCFI 507; HCCC 413/2016 (22 March 2017),"28.  Madam Cheuk explained that the defendant since his return to the hostel has been stable and content.  She further explained that
the defendant’s activities are under supervision and control, and staff monitor his interaction with others which is carefully
calibrated and limited. The defendant also receives appropriate psychiatric and counselling care and his behavior is reviewed on
a regular basis depending on his emotional state. It is anticipated that this will continue for at least the next 6 months. 29.  The incident in this case involved the defendant rushing forward towards another resident and pushing him.  It was a single act
which resulted in the other resident falling backwards and hitting his head on the ground.  Unfortunately, it resulted in his death.
 I am told, and I accept, that the defendant has in the past been a reasonably well behaved and cooperative resident at the hostel,
and this was an isolated incident.  With this in mind, as well as the purpose and powers of a guardian and the system and measures
that are in place at the hostel, I am satisfied that a guardianship order is not necessary.   30.  In light of the foregoing, I therefore order the defendant’s absolute discharge.",Dates of Hearing: 24 January and 22 March 2017Date of Sentence: 22 March 2017,(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/507.html,"

WING MING GARMENT FACTORY LTD v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF WING MING INDUSTRIAL CENTRE [2017] HKCFI 509; HCCT 60/2006 (22 March 2017),"11.  As for using one‑third of the HSBC prime rate, it appears to me that Reyes J adopted that probably because of the delay in proceeding
with the counterclaim, which was brought in 1993 but only tried in 2007.  As a result, while he awarded interest for the entire period
from the date of the counterclaim, he reduced the rate of interest in light of that delay.  Having regard to my conclusion about
the period in which interest should be awarded, this is not a reason to adopt a lower rate in this case. 12.  The prevalent practice in Hong Kong, at least since 1984, has been to adopt the rate of prime plus 1% “unless the evidence in
a particular case makes adoption of another rate appropriate” (see Polyset Ltd v Panhandat Ltd (FACV 28/2000, 25 April 2002), §13), such as where it can be shown that the application of the general practice would be “substantially
unfair either to one party or the other”: Shearson Lehman v Maclaine Watson (No 2) [1990] 3 All ER 723, 733, applied in The Hongkong Electric Co Ltd v Commissioner of Rating and Valuation (unrep, LDGA 224 & 358/2004, 12 April 2010), §§24–26. 13.  There is no evidence of any particular unfairness to any party if the general practice is followed or any special reason why a different
rate should be applied.  I therefore adopt the usual rate of prime plus 1% pa as the rate of pre‑judgment interest.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/509.html,"

as varied and supplemented by the 1st Supplemental and 2nd Supplemental, and X, LHK and LG are all closely related.  The liability of X under the Guarantee depends on whether LHK is liable
to the plaintiffs under the BOT and the 2nd Supplemental.  Since I am staying the action against LHK to arbitration, it will be a waste of costs and risking conflicting outcomes
in the arbitration and in these proceedings, if I were to allow this action against X to proceed in tandem with the arbitration.
 For these reasons, I will exercise the court’s discretion under its inherent jurisdiction, to stay the plaintiffs’ claims against
X in these proceedings until after the resolution of the arbitration between POL, PHIL, LHK and LG. 60.  The application by LHK and X for stay of these proceedings is accordingly granted, in term of paragraph 1 of the Summons issued
on 5 December 2016.  I make an order nisi that the costs of the stay application are to be paid by the POL and PHIL to LHK and X,

and drainage, such as a hairdresser or foot massage parlour, would pay more than the 30+ tenants in the arcade doing printing business
or selling sports shoes.  The pool of potential tenants to this particular building would be reduced but the nature of the arcade
suggests that the reduction to that pool would be small.  Equally the difference in rental potential between the reduced pool and
the maximum pool is likely, on the available evidence, also to be small.  Mr Cheung’s figure of $123,000 in 2012 for the unit with
water and drainage seems unrealistic.  The actual rent achieved, with water, was $82,000.  Mr Cheung’s figure represents a 50%
increase because of additional drainage. Two years later, in 2014, Mrs Chan was receiving $98,000 a month.  This is clearly in the
same general range as Mr Siu calculated to be appropriate.  It should nonetheless be recognized that the unit with drainage is worth
more than without.  Thus, a small, possibly even token, increase would have been added to reflect this. 80.  In the course of the hearing the value of the defendant’s counterclaim was pared down from a small sum to a tiny sum.  All that
is now claimed is $1,600 for the cost of dismantling the illegal pipework installed in 2010.  Mr Chan’s evidence (for the IO) concerning
this invoice was unclear.  I dismiss the counterclaim with no order as to costs. 81.

application for the discharge/variation of the disclosure order is refused. 42.  As aforesaid, the issue about the ownership of Rs’ assets should be the subject matter of a trial according to the Masri procedure. However, Rs are still studying and preferably the Masri procedure should take place not during school term.  Moreover, the date for the criminal trial of Mrs Chun, who will be an important
witness for Rs, is not yet known. Therefore, I leave it for the parties to discuss the preferable hearing dates for the Masri procedure.  For avoidance of doubt, whilst I have expressed certain views above in relation to the probabilities or otherwise of
certain matters, those views are necessarily provisional in the sense that they are based solely on affirmation evidence.  The judge
who is going to preside over the Masri procedure will of course be entitled to form his own views on those matters and he will also have the added advantage, which I do
not have, of seeing and hearing to witnesses giving evidence in the witness box. 43.  Given the aforesaid results, I am of the view that Ps are the major winner of this hearing, although Rs are successful in having

that this appeal is a re-hearing of the plaintiff’s application, the Notice of Appeal was primarily a criticism of the Master’s
approach to the application.  ‌Before me the defendant’s counsel relied on his skeleton submissions and reply submissions for
the hearing before the Master.  The skeleton submission amounted to 22 pages and the reply submissions amounted to 10 pages.  For
the appeal, the defendant’s counsel filed written submissions amounting to 36 pages, which apart from a brief introduction and
outline of the parties’ respective cases, were submissions criticizing the Master’s approach.  Given that the appeal was a re-hearing
the written submissions filed for the appeal criticizing the Master’s approach were unnecessary.",Date of Judgment: 24 March 2017(Nicholas Cooney SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/536.html,"

the court and Manulife from the Bar table, without giving any or any sufficient particulars, that his intended trial counsel had
fallen seriously ill and that he had been unable to find new counsel within the time available.  Such ground, if properly made out
on evidence, would have justified an adjournment.  I stood the matter down for the morning to enable Mr Wong to put in evidence and
for inquiry to be made with the Legal Aid Department as Mr Wong also claimed to have applied for legal aid.  With regard to the latter
matter, it transpired that Mr Wong had only obtained the form for application for legal aid on the preceding Friday. 79.  Mr Wong returned in the afternoon with an affirmation made by the solicitor who formerly handled this case for Mr Wong. Unfortunately,
that deposition did not add materially to what Mr Wong had told the court in the morning, which was not much.  80.  The court does not lightly grant an open adjournment of a trial on the first day.  As I said earlier, the sudden illness of counsel
for a party close to the beginning of the trial and the party’s inability to replace counsel within a short time, if substantiated,
may ground an adjournment.  However, the court must be supplied with adequate particulars and supporting materials to properly assess
whether such ground has been made out or not.  The evidence adduced by Mr Wong fell somewhat short.","TOTAL:

 The press area admittedly enjoys some undeniable advantages, but there will be large video walls and television screens set up in

were no photographs of him making the sale or evidence from any of the women.  There may have been a misunderstanding because the
handbags he bought were not inside plastic bags and there were hawkers around in the area.  He was mistaken for a hawker instead
of a customer.  He repeated his defence. 15.  I find nothing unsafe, unsatisfactory or plainly wrong in the magistrate’s findings and am sure she has considered all significant
and relevant evidence in reaching her findings.  She had no doubt the appellant did act in a way as observed by PW1 from not too
far a distance.  PW1 had a good and clear view of the appellant.  The appellant was trying to and successfully sold one of his bags
draped over both arms.  His defence he was carrying his own shopping in this manner was properly rejected as being farfetched.  I
agree with the magistrate’s findings; they cannot be faulted.  One does not require to be fluent in any language to sell and barter
as a hawker. 16.  The appellant was no doubt hawking handbags and correctly convicted of this offence of establishing or joining in any business whilst

imposed financial hardship on the appellant and his family.  I sympathise and I am sure there is a financial hardship that will materialise.
 The appellant stressed that he did not know the vehicle was not insured and he honestly believed it was.  However, I see from the
papers that he admitted that the caller was a stranger, which should have meant he had to be more vigilant, being a professional
driver. 10.  From the papers, I find the magistrate carefully considered whether there was any mitigation that could constitute a special reason
to disqualify the appellant for less than 12 months.  I conclude there is no legal error by the magistrate and I can see no reason
myself why the disqualification should not be 12 months as dictated by the Ordinance.  I see no special reason the magistrate should
have considered applicable to the appellant’s mitigation and sentence. 11.  I therefore find the sentence and disqualification period correct and not manifestly excessive.  I dismiss the appeal against the

appellants is dismissed. 29.  In arriving at his sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for s38AA offences.  Here, the appellants were
convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence of 22 months and 2 weeks is
correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain mitigating factors such
as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here, the appellants did not present
any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm either upon conviction or during the appeal. 30.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellants.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and it
is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. I also dismiss the appeals against sentence.","ALI, JAMSHAID

the plaintiff in equal shares as beneficial joint tenants.  I agree that, upon her death, her beneficial interest in the Property
passed automatically to the plaintiff by virtue of the operation of the principle of survivorship.  As held in Tan Cheng Gay v Tan Choo Suan (2015) 18 HKCFAR 430 at 449, §62: 18.  For these reasons, I shall make the declarations sought by the plaintiff in paragraphs 1 to 3 of the prayer for relief in the Amended
Originating Summons, which have been set out in paragraph 1 of this judgment above. 19.  The plaintiff asks for costs.  In practice, since it appears that the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man are the only two beneficiaries
of the Deceased’s estate, the plaintiff wants Chan Wai Man to bear half of the costs of these proceedings.  I note that L Chan
J has already ordered on 20 May 2015 that there be no order as to costs between the plaintiff and Chan Wai Man.  After that, Chan
Wai Man decided not to be appointed as the personal representation of the Deceased’s estate and ceased to take part in these proceedings.
 Notwithstanding that, in order to perfect the plaintiff’s title to the Property, he would have to seek the court’s assistance
in any event.  It appears to me that the costs that he has incurred (apart from those which have been covered by the said order of
L Chan J) are unavoidable.  In the circumstances, as a matter of discretion, I shall make no order as to costs.",Date of Judgment: 30 March 2017(Paul Lam SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/580.html,"

given that there have been numerous complaints and issues raised, and that there was no dispute that they have no title or any private
law right to the land in question. 28.  There is a suggestion that the applicants were genuinely aggrieved because the failure to register them as squatters in the 1982
survey meant that they would not receive any resettlement or compensation arrangements under the squatter hut policy.  I can only
say that if this is their real grievance, then it is not relevant to the present application for judicial review because it is neither
a challenge against the omission to register the shops in 1982 nor a challenge against any decision, which actually has not yet been
taken, not to consider affording them resettlement or compensation arrangements. 29.  For all these reasons, the application for leave must be dismissed.  The application by summons to adduce further evidence accordingly

HKSAR v. MODERN CONCRETE DRILL CUT CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 576; HCMA 362/2016 (31 March 2017),"87.  The Appellant, facing two different summonses, has the right to defend both summonses. Had it not been charged with the second summons,
the defence would have been focused only on the first summons.  Even if the second summons, as the Magistrate believed, was part
and partial of the safe system of work, I do not think that it should be a good reason to deprive the Appellant entirely of the costs
for the preparation of defence in the second summons. There must have been some extra costs incurred for the preparation of the defence
in the second summons.  It would be a matter for taxation. 88.  The Respondent argues that the acquittal was technical as the Magistrate found there was no supervision in the operation. In HKSAR v Tsang Wai Ping (2005) 8 HKCFARD825, Bokhary PJ expressed caution about depriving an acquitted defendant of costs on this ground (see Hong Kong Archbold
2017 ed para 6-12). More importantly the Magistrate, as I read his reasons for refusal of costs, did not say that he refused costs
on this basis. 89.  In any case, as a result of my decision to allow the appeal against the conviction of the first summons, I do not think that it
is just to refuse costs on the acquitted summons.  I would therefore also allow the appeal against the no-costs order of the Magistrate.
The Appellant will have costs on Summons F for the trial, to be taxed if not agreed.","andMODERN CONCRETE DRILL CUT CO., LIMITED

to draw the necessary inference that a person is in employment” (para 34).  The magistrate was satisfied that the sole and compelling
inference here on the facts was that the appellant was in employment.  The truck was used for the purposes of collecting dirty linen
and delivering clean linen in return.  The photos show more carts laden with clean cloths inside the truck.  There were carts used
for the purposes of transporting and collecting linen to be picked up.  The appellant was facilitating this by doing the physical
work of changing carts.  29.  I too am satisfied on the evidence that the only irresistible inference that can be drawn is that the appellant was taking employment

and foremost, what the Debtor did at the behest of Law in 2012 / 2013 sheds very little light on whether she was under Law’s undue
influence between 2004 and 2009.  Further, while the re‑financing arrangement whereby the Debtor “transferred” the mortgage
of the property from Citibank to DBS Bank may or may not objectively speaking be manifestly disadvantageous to her, subjectively,

SO SAU LAI CONNIE T/A WING FUNG TRADING CO v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD [2017] HKCFI 586; HCA 2807/2004 (3 April 2017),"14.  As evident from the Judgment, DBS prevailed at the end of the day. DBS also obtained costs orders in HCA2807/2004 and HCMP1361/
2005 in its favour, so it was entitled to proceed with taxation and recovery of such costs. Given the nature of the 2 sets of legal
proceedings, the involvement of counsel and experts as well as the interlocutory procedures and the trial that took place, there
was real likelihood that DBS’ eventual agreed/taxed costs might be a substantial portion of or even more than the amount of the
Surplus Proceeds, especially when such costs were to be taxed on indemnity basis. In such circumstances and given the clear contemplation
that the Surplus Proceeds (derived from the Property that was charged to secure such costs before it was sold) should be used to
secure costs liability to DBS should it succeed at trial (which it eventually did), it is entirely appropriate for the Surplus Proceeds
to remain in court pending agreement between the parties on such costs or pending completion of the taxation procedure, and then
for the eventual agreed/taxed costs to be satisfied by payment out from the Surplus Proceeds to DBS, and for any remaining balance
to be paid to NH. 15.  Since DBS was successful on the Summonses filed pursuant to the Direction, costs in respect of such Summonses should follow event. 16.  I therefore grant an order in terms of paragraphs 1-3 of the Summonses save and except that in paragraph 3 thereof the words “Messrs

 It was not an attack by a single punch.  While the Magistrate accepted that there was no evidence of any weapon being used and the
injury was not a permanent one, the assault caused a 2-cm laceration and bleeding to the left ear of PW1.  Had the Appellant not
been restrained by another person, the injury of PW1 could have been more severe. 57.  Whether PW1 received suturing to his ear or not, his injury was serious. The sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment cannot be said
to be manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. 58.  The appeal against sentence is also dismissed.","andVINCENT THOMAS

CHANG PUI YIN AND OTHERS v. BANK OF SINGAPORE LTD [2017] HKCFI 605; HCCL 12/2013 (5 April 2017),"11.  The Defendant has emphasized that the duty of an expert is to assist the court.  That is fully accepted.  If, at the trial on quantum,
this court should find the evidence of Dr Vinaimont to be as unhelpful on the issue of quantum as Bharwaney J found him to be on
the issue of the assessment of risks, I see no reason why this court should doubt the ability of the Plaintiffs’ expert to give
the necessary objective and impartial assistance required on the issue of the quantum of the Plaintiffs’ loss.  Experts are to
be impartial and are independent of the party engaging them to give expert evidence.  The Defendant’s counsel will be in a position
to put questions to Mr Green on the question of the quantum of loss, if the Defendant considers that Doctor Vinaimont has not adequately
addressed the issue.  It is indeed the trend of the courts now to have a single joint expert to be appointed by both parties to the
action, and to rely on such expert evidence with the confidence that the single joint expert would be able to give all the necessary
assistance required in order to address the concerns of both parties. 12.  In all the circumstances of this case, bearing in mind in particular the advanced ages of the Plaintiffs, the time-lapse between
the commencement of proceedings in 2011 and the assessment of the quantum of damages, and balancing the justice to both sides of
the case, I consider that it is in the interests of both parties and consistent with the just resolution of the dispute that further
time and costs should be saved.  Rather than having a new expert brought in at this stage, which would necessitate a new report to
be prepared by Mr Green in response to Mr Malik’s report, a further meeting of the experts and a joint statement to be prepared,
the trial on quantum can fairly proceed with the existing reports of Dr Vinaimont and Mr Green, and for them to be questioned at
trial on their evidence.  If the Defendant has indeed lost confidence in Dr Vinaimont, it is open to the parties to call Mr Green
as the single joint expert. 13.  For these reasons, I dismiss the Defendant’s application, with costs to the Plaintiffs.","andBANK OF SINGAPORE LIMITED

is whether the overstatement is causing any prejudice to the debtor.  In Winterthur Life Insurance v Au Oi Fong[20], Chu J said the following relating to an overstatement of the amount of the debt in a statutory demand: 49.  I agree with Mr Yu that no injustice has been caused to the Debtor by reason of the overstatement.  Firstly, the overstatement is
negligible as compared to the size of the Debt.  Secondly, there is no suggestion whatsoever that, if the correct amount of the Debt
was stated in the Statutory Demand and the Petition, the Debtor would have settled the Debt.  Indeed, that suggestion is inconsistent
with the Debtor’s stance that the MF Payments were her “commissions”.  Hence, the Debtor cannot rely on such ground to oppose the Petition. 50.  For the above reasons, the Debtor has failed to establish a bona fide dispute as to the Debt and I therefore make a usual bankruptcy order with costs against the Debtor.",(David Lok)Judge of the Court of First instance,High Court,/2017/606.html,"

were a sham.  Even assuming, as the Plaintiff’s case invites the court to do, that Anthony did no more than produce the resolutions
in his office at a time convenient to himself and that in no sense can there be said to have been a meeting, it does not seem to
me that the irregularity principle is circumvented.  On the assumption that Anthony and Genius Villa were able to convene general
meetings and pass the resolutions then in my view the irregularity does apply. 18.  What has given me pause for thought is a point that arose during my questions to Mr Lau.  It seems to be the Plaintiff’s case
that if he had had notice of the meetings then he could have taken action to enjoin Anthony from causing the resolutions to be passed
pending determination of the dispute about ownership of the shares in the companies registered in Anthony and Genius Villa’s names.
 However, Mr Lau expressly disavowed reliance on any irregularity in service of the notices.  If the notices were served properly,
which Mr Lau’s concession requires me to assume, then the only irregularity was in the way the resolution was passed.  That issue
does not turn on the question of beneficial ownership of the shares and who was entitled to decide how the shares were voted.  If
Anthony had caused meetings, albeit as formalities, to take place in accordance with the articles and the requirements of the Companies Ordinance, it necessarily follows that the Plaintiff’s complaints would fall away.  It, therefore, seems to me that the Plaintiff’s case

DENNIS KWOK HON MING v. POON SUI CHEONG ALBERT AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 614; HCMP 1526/2013 (6 April 2017),"30.  I am not satisfied that P will be unable to pay or repay the Majority Shareholders the costs and/or buy-out sum for which he would
be liable if the appeal were successful in setting aside the buy-out order, whether before or after the buy-out is executed. 31.  The Majority Shareholders’ submissions as to serious deleterious effect if there is no stay are based on (1) the wasted costs
of the valuation exercise should the buy-out order be overturned (estimated at about HK$2.5 million) and (2) the wasted time and
effort required for the valuation exercise. Wasted costs, time and effort are clearly to be avoided if possible.  However, the position
here is that if the appeal is not successful then the valuation is necessary, and further delay is to be avoided because (1) it is
clearly better for the valuation exercise to be conducted as close as possible to the date at which the value is to be ascertained
and (2) the problems between the Majority Shareholders and P (which I consider to have been unfairly prejudicial conduct against
P) commenced approximately 20 years ago.  As to the wasted costs, if P wishes to push ahead with the valuation which then turns out
to be wasted in light of a successful appeal, then he bears the risk of the wasted costs; and I am not persuaded he could not pay
those costs as I have addressed above. As to the wasted time and effort, that is a function of litigation — for example, it may
well be that P has to expend wasted time and effort on the appeals (if he is ultimately successful), but that would not be a basis
for preventing the appeals. 32.  It follows that I am not satisfied that the appeal(s) would be rendered nugatory if I do not grant a stay of execution.  The applications

effort required for the valuation exercise. Wasted costs, time and effort are clearly to be avoided if possible.  However, the position
here is that if the appeal is not successful then the valuation is necessary, and further delay is to be avoided because (1) it is
clearly better for the valuation exercise to be conducted as close as possible to the date at which the value is to be ascertained
and (2) the problems between the Majority Shareholders and P (which I consider to have been unfairly prejudicial conduct against
P) commenced approximately 20 years ago.  As to the wasted costs, if P wishes to push ahead with the valuation which then turns out
to be wasted in light of a successful appeal, then he bears the risk of the wasted costs; and I am not persuaded he could not pay
those costs as I have addressed above. As to the wasted time and effort, that is a function of litigation — for example, it may
well be that P has to expend wasted time and effort on the appeals (if he is ultimately successful), but that would not be a basis
for preventing the appeals. 32.  It follows that I am not satisfied that the appeal(s) would be rendered nugatory if I do not grant a stay of execution.  The applications

"CHAN MICHAEL v. THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF TAM SIU FUNG, DECEASED [2017] HKCFI 621; HCMP 745/2015 (7 April 2017)","8.  Under section 7(2) of the Limitation Ordinance (Cap 347) (“the LO”), the limitation period is 12 years.  In this case, the limitation period expired in about 2007 and before
the commencement of these proceedings.  Section 17 of the LO provides that, at the expiration of the limitation period, the title of the registered owner to the land shall be extinguished.
 By virtue of these statutory provisions, I am satisfied that the legal title of the defendant to the Property has been extinguished
in about 2007 by the plaintiff’s adverse possession of the Property since about 1995. 9.  In the circumstances, I shall grant the following declarations sought by the plaintiff: 10.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision:  7 April 2017(Paul Lam SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/621.html,"

out of high emotion or fear.  He must have paid great efforts in preparing such chili spray or arranging for such spray to be obtained,
which involved a high degree of planning.  Besides, D1 had a total of 5 bottles of such liquid in his possession, which suggested
that he had the intention of using them continuously.  The risk that some could have fallen in the hands of other people for illegal
use could not be ignored either. 124.   Bringing chili spray to protest and petition locations not only causes the aforesaid concern, it also affects the right of the
public to participate in peaceful protests and petitions.  When the possibility of people bringing offensive weapons to protest and
petition locations becomes a worrying concern, the public who only intend to express their views in a peaceful manner would probably
hold back and give up their right of peaceful protest and petition.  This would affect the public in respect of the exercise of an
important right, the consequences of which cannot be ignored. 125.   All in all, I take the view that the sentence of D1 is severe and perhaps there is room for a slight downward adjustment, but it
cannot be regarded as manifestly excessive.  Accordingly, the appeal against sentence is dismissed and the original sentence of 9
months is affirmed.",(Albert Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/623.html,"

LAM MAN CHIU v. HONG KONG FLOURTECH LTD [2017] HKCFI 626; HCPI 1083/2006 (7 April 2017),"8.  On this ground alone, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has abused the court’s process, which provides me with a sufficient ground
to exercise my discretion to dismiss the action.  I also note the defendant’s evidence that it will suffer prejudice if the trial
is to take place now. There are factual disputes in this case.  I agree with Mr Cheung’s general observation that, although the
witnesses had made witness statements, it will be difficult for them to recollect what happened back in 2003.  Mr Cheung mentioned
that Mr Tang Kim Kwong, who was an operation supervisor employed by a private investigation company, had passed away.  In Mr Tang’s
witness statement, he merely produced a VCD record of surveillance on the plaintiff on 29 April 2005.  I do not believe his death
would have any material impact on a trial so long as the VCD is still available.  However, I am more concerned about Mr Cheung’s
evidence that the defendant’s solicitors are no longer able to contact Mr Lai Wing Nin, one of the defendant’s witnesses who
had made a witness statement dated 16 June 2007.  Mr Lai was supposed to give evidence as to the availability of safety goggles and
that the plaintiff was seen wearing such goggles before the accident.  The defendant’s evidence on prejudice has not been challenged.
 In view of such evidence, I am satisfied that, if the case goes to trial now, the defendant will suffer material prejudice caused
by the plaintiff’s delay in prosecuting these proceedings.  Hence, there is more the reason why I ought to exercise my discretion
to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. 9.  In the circumstances, I shall dismiss the action with costs in terms of the defendant’s summons.  As the plaintiff was once on
legal aid, to err on the safe side, I shall also order that the plaintiff’s own costs be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations. 10.  I shall also direct that, when this decision is handed down, a court interpreter should be arranged to be present in order to explain

and her judgment.  However, I am unable to find any evidence to the effect that C had agreed with D2 to do only (the first) part
of the project.  Indeed, the further point now raised by C is inconsistent with his case at the trial, which was that the whole project
belonged to him and that D2 was only his employee.  Secondly, on the evidence D2’s offer to pay C 50% was only a settlement offer
which had not been taken up.  Thirdly, based on what was before the Adjudicator, she was quite entitled to find as a fact that C
had committed a repudiatory breach of the oral agreement (which she found to have existed) by walking out of the project before its
completion, so as to enable D2 to treat himself as no longer being bound by the oral agreement.  Fourthly, I can find no mistake
on point of law in her finding that C’s work done amounted only to about 25% of the project. 8.  According to s 28 of the Small Claims Tribunal Ordinance, Cap 338, this court can only grant leave to appeal on (i) any ground involving a question of law or (ii) the ground that the claim
was outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  However, in the present case none of the above is involved.  C’s complaint is really
about the assessment of credibility of witnesses and the findings of fact which are generally within the province of the Adjudicator.
 In the circumstances, this court is not in a positon to grant any leave to appeal: James Manuel Ho & Anor v Grand Pacific Vacation (Hong Kong) Limited, HCSA 5/2004. 9.  Based on the above, C’s application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  There is no order as to costs for this application.","Velo‑citi Limited

I take some comfort for that view from the judgment of Lord Justice Widgery in R v Saville [1980] EWCA Crim 1;  [1981] 1 QB 12 (sitting I might add with Bridge LJ and Woolf J as he then was) when he found that the Crown Court had an inherent jurisdiction to
remedy mistakes in the record and from his reliance upon Rubin J in R v Michael [1976] QB 414, where Rubin J said: 6.  However, these were cases which were civil in nature and the authorities provided to this court have been in respect of the appellate
jurisdiction of the court. None of them stand on all fours with the matter before me but I do feel that on the facts of this case,
the same principles apply.  This was a mathematical error which should not have been made. 7.  That being said, this is an issue of the liberty of the individual.  It is not, as was the case before Widgery LJ, an “unimportant
matter”.  Albeit that it refers to just two months’ imprisonment, it is two months of someone’s life and liberty and to this
defendant it is very important indeed.  The issue is therefore whether I should exercise my discretion and amend the record to show
the true intention of the court, or, in the circumstances of this case, not do so.  The defendant left this court room on 27 March
2017 expecting to serve 6 years and 6 months in prison less any reduction she may earn by reason of her good behaviour.  This is
her first term of imprisonment although she has previously been the subject of Rehabilitation and DATC orders as well as probation.
 She is just 21 years old.  The sentences were ordered to be consecutive after taking into account the issue of totality of sentence.
 They were entirely separate offending.  Be that as it may, she expected a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months.  It was
my error and whilst I do not resile from the sentence I intended she should serve, I do not feel in all the circumstances of this
case where there is just two months’ imprisonment at stake for a woman serving her first sentence of imprisonment after a very
difficult life, that it is appropriate to amend the record to reflect my true intent at that time.",Date of Hearing:　11 April 2017Date of Ruling:　11 April 2017,"(A P Campbell Moffat)

his co-accused Wong and Fong had given non-prejudicial statements against the defendant. Therefore in place of Yang there was the
likelihood of his co-accused giving evidence for the prosecution.  37.  As the defendant’s plea of guilty was not a timely plea the defendant is not entitled to the usual one third discount.  I shall
afford him a 25% or one quarter discount. 38.  The sentencing point had the defendant been convicted after trial would have been one of 8 years’ imprisonment, giving him a 25%
discount upon his plea of guilty the resulting sentence is one of 6 years’ imprisonment to which he shall so serve.",Dates of Hearing: 11 & 12 April 2017Date of Reasons for Sentence: 12 April 2017,(D’ Almada Remedios)Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/817.html,"

MUNIR AHMAD v. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION [2017] HKCFI 678; HCAL 130/2017 (13 April 2017),"22.  On the question of whether the applicant has been detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, there is nothing
in the evidence before the court to show that the Director is using the power of detention for any purposes other than for removal
of the applicant, or it has become apparent to the Director at any time that it would not be possible to effect the applicant’s
removal within a reasonable time.  The evidence shows that a removal order was issued against the applicant shortly after his discharge
from prison and, subject to the issuance of an emergency travel document by the Pakistani Consulate,the Director is in a position
to remove the applicant at any time thereafter.  There is nothing to suggest that the Director has failed to act with reasonable
diligence or expedition to effect the applicant’s removal.  It is also reasonable of the Director to take the view that the applicant
can be removed within a reasonable period of time.   In all the circumstances, I find that the applicant has been detained for a
period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, and his current detention is compliance with the Hardial Singh principles. 23.  None of the grounds relied upon by the applicant can justify the issue of a writ of habeas corpus in the present case.  While the court has sympathy with his personal and family circumstances, they do not affect the legality of
his detention.  24.  The application for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed, with no order as to costs.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/678.html,"

WEI XING v. WILLWIN DEVELOPMENT (ASIA) CO LTD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 680; HCMP 1922/2016 (13 April 2017),"26.  There will accordingly be the orders referred to above, with liberty to apply. 27.  In connection with costs, Mr Vaughan contended that Wen should not have been joined as a respondent at all and there should not
be a costs order against him, relying on Re Opes Asia Development Ltd (unrep, HCMP 447/2012, 17 May 2012) at §42 and Leung Chung Pun v Masterwise International Ltd [2014] HKCFI 101; [2014] 1 HKLRD 1129 at §§66–68.  In myview, however, the present case is special and quite different from those two cases.  There are only 2 shareholders
in the Company which is a private company: Wen and Xing.  There are at present only 2 directors of the Company: Wen and a person
called Zheng Fang.  There is no evidence as to who Zheng is and why he or she has been appointed a director.  As 70% shareholder
Wen is essentially in control of the composition of the Board.  Xing had been denied even the first category of documents above,
ie resolutions and minutes of general meeting and audited accounts, to which a shareholder is plainly and indisputably entitled under
the law.  There is and can be no explanation, and no reason has been offered by Zheng, why these documents had not been provided
to Xing, except for the fact that Wen has been at loggerheads with him.  The second and third categories of documents relate to SWI’s
or SWT’s dealing with the Company and Wen’s borrowing from the Company — matters in which Wen had a clear personal interest.
 Wen’s response to the present application in correspondence or on his affirmations was not that he was only a director and would
let the Company deal with it.  Instead he actively opposed the application and sought security for his own costs.  All the indicators
there are suggest that the Company’s response has been dictated by Wen’s position and that this litigation is in substance a
further episode of the acrimonious dispute between the two brothers Wen and Xing. 28.  Accordingly I think there is basis for an order that Wen should pay the costs of the application.  However, on a provisional basis,
I do not think Xing should have all his costs because (1) the application as originally framed was hopelessly wide; and (2) his 1st affirmation contains various assertions that are untenable in the light of the court’s findings in HCA 797/2012.  As an order nisi, I would order that Wen do pay Xing two‑thirds of the costs of the application, to be taxed if not agreed.","31/3/3012

that value might have been on 11 February 2011 if Wise Lords had not acquired US$83m worth of AUD from 24 July to 5 August 2008 and

such relief. Acquiring a possessory title through possession for the duration of the limitation period (even if established) does
not operate as a statutory conveyance and does not entitle the holder of possessory title to be registered as owner in substitution
of the paper-title owner.[3]","U HA MIN also known as TAM MAN (譚民)

finding on the credibility of the witness.  He had the advantage of hearing and seeing PW4 give evidence and study his demeanor.
 I saw no other reason for interfering with that ruling. 39.  In conclusion, the magistrate’s findings were not unreasonable, illogical or inherently improbable.  The magistrate did not fail
to consider any material fact or misunderstand or misquote any material fact.  I am satisfied the magistrate fairly and properly
considered the issues raised. 40.  I find no basis to interfere with the magistrate’s findings of fact and his assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.  The
evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt it was the appellant who assaulted PW1.  Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.","andTSANG, CHEUK-HIM ADLEY

the preceding grounds “and/or generally”, the Appellant’s conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory.  I have already rejected
the preceding grounds and I see no other basis for saying that this conviction is unsafe or unsatisfactory.  Perfected Ground of
Appeal Against Conviction No 4 fails. 30. As to sentence, I have already set out what the Magistrate said on the matter of sentence and I have already set out the terms of
the Perfected Ground of Appeal Against Sentence. It is unfortunate that the Appellant suffered the anguish of receiving on review
an immediate custodial sentence after initially having been dealt with by way of a fine.  The Magistrate gave the Appellant a one‑month
discount for that reason.  All things considered, I find no basis on which to interfere with the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment
imposed on review. 31. For the foregoing reasons, both the appeal against conviction and the appeal against sentence are dismissed.",Date of Judgment:  24 April 2017(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/990.html,"

to accept his evidence and that he was not given a fair trial.  In my view, it is not necessary to further consider and analyse other
grounds here in detail.  As the magistrate stated in paragraph 34 of his Statement of Findings, 21.  I have found that the magistrate’s approach in dealing with PW1’s evidence was improper as stated above.  For this reason, the
prosecution had failed to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the offence. 22.  For the above reasons, I allow the appellant’s appeal against conviction.  Since the appellant has already completed the community
service under the Community Service Order, I order that the conviction, the fine and the compensation order be quashed. ",(Judianna Barnes)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/721.html,"

by the same.  The Allotment was meant to result in a larger capital base for Ricco.  That purpose was not achieved, and as pointed
out by Ms Law, the trading partners and creditors of Ricco might have been misled by the Allotment exercise. 19.  Finally, Mr Wong has urged the court not to dispose of these matters in a summary manner.  The answer is that there is no material
factual dispute which may justify a full trial. 20.  For these reason, I hold that the Allotment was in breach of s.47A of the Ordinance.  I shall hear the parties on the appropriate

his summary submission dated 5 December 2016.  This court agrees with Ms Chui, Legal Aid Counsel for the Petitioner, that the Debtor
is essentially repeating his case and, in particular, his disputes with the Petitioner over a squatter hut in DCCJ 3434/2011 and
sought to adjourn the present proceedings until the conclusion of the District Court action.  This court further agrees that none
of the “grounds” raised by the Debtor constitute a bona fide dispute to the Debt on substantial grounds.  Lastly, this court agrees with Ms Chui that the “grounds” raised by the Debtor are
in substance a repetition of those he raised in HCSD 45/2016, which were rejected by Au‑Yeung J, and that there has been no change
of circumstances since the dismissal of his application to set aside the Statutory Demand. 15.  To conclude, in the present case, the Debtor has failed in his application to set aside the Statutory Demand, failed to show a bona fide dispute to the Debt on substantial grounds or “fraud, collusion or miscarriage of justice”.

is satisfied that the Petition is well‑founded and the Petitioner is entitled to a bankruptcy order against the Debtor. 16.

In the course of the hearing, I indicated to the parties that many of the affirmations filed for use in these proceedings were a

Ps have not even satisfied the fundamental question of providing the reason for requiring the 2nd expert report.  The proposed 2nd expert report is not in the bundle. There is no evidence to show how the 2nd expert report can deal with the defects which had been remedied by the replacement contractors.  As such, they have not been able
to discharge the burden for their application, which must be dismissed, with costs. 20.  As to the costs of these applications, there is no reason why the costs should not follow the event.  Ps ask for costs on the basis
that paragraph 22A, which they succeed is the main amendment whereas paragraph 15A is the subsidiary.  I am afraid that I am unable
to see such relationship between these two paragraphs.  Ds submit that there should be no order as to costs for the amendment application

"HKSAR v. LI, KA HO [2017] HKCFI 745; HCMA 526/2016 (2 May 2017)","32.  I have considered the 2nd ground and if PW1 did struggle and they were still embracing then yes common sense dictates it would have caused the appellant’s
penis to rub against her.  However, it was not PW1’s evidence that she only felt it after she struggled so I can understand why
this was not a possibility considered by the magistrate in his deliberations.  Whilst it is correct the prosecution has a duty to
prove the assault was intentional and indecent, the 2nd ground fails.  33.  This is a rehearing and I must review the evidence to see if I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.
 In the premises, I am not satisfied that the trial magistrate showed he considered the discrepancies in PW1’s evidence as to timing
of the assault.  It is therefore not clear if this was taken into account when making a finding of PW1’s credibility.  The conviction
of the appellant is therefore unsafe and cannot stand.  34.  I cannot be sure that the appellant intentionally assaulted PW1 indecently.  The appeal is therefore allowed and the conviction

set out in paragraphs 11 – 13 above.  Clause 19 showed that the Pledgee was not denying the title of the Pledgor over the Pledged
Shares but only claimed to be entitled to retain the Pledged Shares as security for the loan.  In any case, the Sum represented security
for payment of all obligations in full.  Defence (c) was unsustainable. 37.  The conditions in Order 29, rule 6 having been complied with, the Pledgor was plainly entitled to the return of the Pledged Shares.
 There was nothing from the Pledgee’s side which would have persuaded the court to exercise the discretion in another way.  I therefore
made the order as sought. 38.  Costs should follow the event.  I therefore granted costs to the plaintiff with certificates for 2 counsel. ",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/762.html,"

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. “C”AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 754; HCMP 727/2008 (4 May 2017),"52.  Whether the Mainland employees were beneficial owners of the ATML’s shares or were a mere “front” of Lu is a matter that can only be determined at the trial.  It is not good enough at the interlocutory stage for Chu to speculate
in her affirmation that there would have been no reason for replenishment of ATML’s shares if they belonged to Lu. In any event,
in §31 of her first affirmation filed on 15 April 2008 in support of the application for the Injunction Order, Madam Wong Mei Mei
expressly mentioned the allegation by the former company secretary of ATML that the shares might belong to the Mainland staff of
ATML.  Further, the statements of the relevant securities account were also exhibited.[13]  Hence, I see no merit in the non-disclosure argument. 53.  For the above reasons, I find that there is no good reason to disturb the Injunction Order re-imposed by the Court of Appeal back
in May 2009.  I therefore dismiss the Variation Application.  I also make an order nisi that the costs of the Variation Application be costs in the cause of China United’s claim for the return of the Fund, which shall
be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Decision. 54.  That leaves only the application by the SFC to join China United as an additional defendant in this action.  The Injunction Order
would affect the interest of China United because the Shares were held in its name.  China United has no objection to the joinder
even if it fails in the Variation Application.  However, there is some confusion as to whether the other Defendants have been notified
of SFC’s joinder application.  As they have the right to be heard, I would adjourn the Joinder Summons pending the clarification
of such issue.","andCHINA UNITED TELECOM LTD

"GIORDANO INTERNATIONAL LTD v. HENRY FOK ESTATES, LTD [2017] HKCFI 761; HCA 2251/2016 (4 May 2017)","21.  At the first hearing, the defendant engaged senior and junior counsel. It was contradictory to the defendant’s own stance that
the stay application involved no dispute of fact and was based on “settled” and “entrenched” law so much so that the plaintiff
should even be deprived of the opportunity to file evidence.  I disallow the engagement of senior counsel as unreasonable and substitute
it with a hypothetical junior in the costs assessment. 22.  The plaintiff’s affirmation in relation to the issue of costs was mostly a regurgitation of the correspondence.  It triggered
a lengthy response from the defendant, also with much reference to the correspondence. The plaintiff has caused costs to escalate
out of proportion to the original procedural step of a stay.  Had the stay application been adjourned for substantive arguments,
the costs (even with senior counsel) should not have exceeded $300,000 on party-and-party basis.  The indemnity costs now sought
for an application that has been withdrawn was totally unreasonable, in my view, and the plaintiff has contributed substantially
to it after the call over in January. 23.  Accordingly, though I award indemnity costs to the defendant, I take into account proportionality as if the solicitors had sensibly
dealt with the matter.  I award a sum of $230,000 to the plaintiff.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/761.html,"

was incorporated in Cyprus and used an address in Toronto, Canada.  According to the plaintiff, the defendant was not known to have

come within the potential errors that are liable to be impugned in the senses discussed in paragraph 6 above.  At this stage of considering
whether to grant leave to appeal, it is inappropriate for me to dwell on the merits of RFMF’s proposed grounds of appeal and/or

CHEN TE KUANG MIKE v. PALADIN LTD [2017] HKCFI 849; HCA 2163/2014 (5 May 2017),"9.  D asks this Court to order indemnity costs against P on P’s conduct.  This must be under O.62, rule 5 RHC.  The Court must take
all factors into consideration, including those factors above. 10.  In the circumstances, taking a broad brush approach, the appropriate costs order for the application should be costs in the cause.
 The costs for today can be regarded as wasted costs, given rise by no response of P’s solicitors to D’s letters in February
this year.  I was told by counsel for D that she only received instructions to act for D in April.  If P had responded positively,
there is simply no need to have the hearing today.  Although I accept that even if the hearing proceeds today, the costs that D will
obtain should be costs in the cause on a party to party basis, I will not award costs to P because this was caused by P’s solicitors’
conduct. D’s conduct of non-compliance with the court’s order for failing to serve the supporting affidavit, though not directly
relevant to the hearing today because P had not raised it as the reason for no response to D’s letters, such misconduct has to
be taken into account as well under O.62, r.5.  I therefore order that there should be no order as to costs for today’s hearing.
 As such, it is not necessary for me to consider whether there should be counsel’s certificate for this hearing. 11.  As to the case management of this case, I shall make an order in terms as follows:",Date of Decision: 5 May 2017(K. W. Lung),"Registrar, High Court",/2017/849.html,"

KERRY FRANCIS MOORE ALSO KNOWN AS KERRY MOORE v. JENNEX CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 790; HCMP 2109/2015 (9 May 2017),"38.  It was suggested that Moore should have agreed to the proposed directions put forward by Lo/Correstone. However, I am unable to
see how it would have saved costs since the procedural and substantive applications and consequent hearings were still required.
The fact that Lo/Correstone did not disagree with the directions sought under the Breach Order did not detract from the fact that
Lo/Jennex were in breach of the Transfer Order which therefore necessitated the enforcement under the Breach Order. 39.  It was also suggested that Lo had incurred significant costs in corresponding with dB&L and in respect of the hearing on 7 December
2016. I have found that the hearing on 7 December 2016 was necessary to deal with anterior procedural issues which could not be dealt
with by consent given the existence of unrepresented parties. Further, part of the correspondence was due to Lo’s/Correstone’s
stance that there was no unreasonable refusal or failure on their part in compliance with the Transfer Order, which Moore had to
refute. By the time DHCJ Kwok SC made the Transfer Order which was binding on Lo, Lo’s anterior reasons for not taking further
steps to effect the transfer as ordered were no longer sufficient answer for his non-compliance of such order. 40.  For all the above reasons, I grant an order that save and except for costs orders made on 7 December 2016, Lo do pay to Moore costs

claims are not unknown to Heung‑A Shipping and Eleni Maritime.  In fact, Smyth & Co had informed them of the additional claimants’

from the Fund, Heung-A Shipping would suffer no loss as a result of the late filing of these additional claims.  Such dilution cannot
in law amount to prejudice.  Eleni Maritime and Heung‑A Shipping, in particular, should not be allowed to benefit from their omission,

RE GARSON REAL PROPERTY AGENCIES (H.K.) LTD (IN CREDITORS’ VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION) [2017] HKCFI 1006; HCCW 342/2014 (11 May 2017),"14.  As I have already explained the Official Receiver relied on accounting and other records in reaching their conclusion that Ms Ho
should be allowed to vote the amount of the debt represented by the bonus.  However, it seems to me having regard to the information
that the audited financial statement provides, the better view is that there is sufficient reason to question whether or not Madam
Ho is entitled to prove for the amount of the bonus, to reverse the Official Receiver’s decision which I do. 15.  The consequence of this is that the decision of the meeting to appoint the liquidators, proposed by the Official Receiver which
were the next liquidators on the Panel A list, should not have been reached because Ms Ho’s admitted debt should have been less
than Ms Zhang’s.  It is perhaps a little unfortunate that this application was advanced as although technically Ms Ho proposed
the liquidators, the names were proposed by the Official Receiver and indeed as it transpires the original nominee has become unavailable,
and instead the Official Receiver has proposed two accountants from FTI.  However, as I understand it from Mr Chan, his instructions
are that having come as far as she has Ms Ho would like her preferred liquidators to be appointed and I will therefore so order.

was some vague suggestion that procedurally he might not be entitled to discovery that is available in Hong Kong.  However, it has
not been shown that discovery is not available in Switzerland.  I am by no means satisfied that Mr Bossard would suffer any procedural
disadvantage by having the dispute decided by the Swiss court. 53.  Physically, he would not be inconvenienced as he lives in Switzerland.  In so far as it was suggested that Swiss court fees are
significant compared to Hong Kong court fees, any such disadvantage would pale into insignificance given the notoriously high litigation
costs involved in any Hong Kong litigation.  54.  For all those reasons, I am satisfied that Switzerland is the proper and appropriate forum for the resolving the partnership dispute.",Date of Judgment: 12 May 2017(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/829.html,"

 In fact the debtor has taken out a summons in the Court of Appeal in HCMP 1061/2017 dated 8 May 2017 for leave to appeal. 14.  In any event I see no merit in the application.  Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the debtor’s affirmation raise no substantial point.  Paragraphs
5 to 25 appear to seek to challenge my conclusions as to the facts, but I do not discern any legitimate basis.  Within them, paragraphs
18 to 20 complain about a letter which was exhibited to a later affidavit of the petitioner.  However, as recorded in footnote 6
in my decision, I had specifically allowed that letter to be produced, and the debtor was cross‑examined on it.  Paragraphs 26
to 33 again seek to challenge my findings of fact, without any promising basis.  Paragraphs 34, 37 to 39 allege “bad faith” on
the part of the petitioner in other matters which are irrelevant for present purposes.  Paragraphs 35–36 and 40 raise no reason
against my costs decision.  Paragraphs 41 to 45 simply reiterate there are errors in my factual conclusions, without offering any
ground with realistic prospect of success. 15.  Given that each of the petitioner and debtor has failed in her application, taking a global view and broadbrush approach, and having
regard in particular to the history of the disputes between the parties, instead of ordering costs to follow the respective events,
I would make an order in respect of each application that there be no order as to costs.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/868.html,"

TOURAY EDRISA v. PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR SECURTIY [2017] HKCFI 836; HCAL 91/2016 (15 May 2017),"67.  I order that the applicant shall pay the costs of the Permanent Secretary in respect of the applications dealt with in this judgment,
to be taxed if not agreed, because the various intended grounds of judicial review are wholly unmeritorious. 68.  As mentioned in the course of the hearing, I am somewhat concerned as to whether it is proper for those acting for the applicant
to raise the ground of discrimination by way of proposed amendments to the Form 86 when there is no apparent factual basis to support
the allegation that the Permanent Secretary has adopted any policy or practice as set out in paragraph 71B of the draft Amended Form
86.  I make no finding as to whether some such policy or practice exists in the absence of evidence.  However, the point is not whether
such policy or practice in fact exists, but whether it is proper to raise an allegation without basis or foundation.  I have given
anxious consideration to the question of whether I ought to allow legal aid taxation in respect of the applicant’s costs incurred
in relation to this proposed ground of judicial review.  On this occasion, I am just prepared to make a general order that the applicant’s
own costs be taxed in in accordance with legal aid regulations, and I so order. 69.  I take this opportunity to remind practitioners that applications for judicial review are often, as in the present case, litigated
on public funds on both sides. The parties are expected to raise and pursue issues reasonably.  The underlying objectives mentioned
in Order 1A, rule 1 of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A, apply as much to 
    applications for judicial review as they do in relation to other civil litigations.","Date of Reasons for Decision: 15 May 2017(Anderson Chow)

HKSAR v. CHEUNG NGAI [2017] HKCFI 837; HCMA 292/2016 (15 May 2017),"17.  In my view, when PW1 demanded $10,000 as compensation from the appellant, the appellant replied: “Even spraying the whole car
won’t need $20,000[4],” it was, by no means, an indication of acceptance of responsibility on the part of the appellant. 18.  To sum up, in my view, the magistrate failed to give independent consideration to the testimony of the appellant as to whether it
was true or might be true when handling this “one against one” case where there was no independent witness or evidence. A particular
matter in this regard is whether PW1 did “overtake” from the appellant’s left but made a denial of it in order to minimize
his involvement in the matter. 19.  For the reasons above, I find that the conviction was unsafe.  As a result, I allow the appeal, quash the conviction and set aside
the sentence.","andCHEUNG NGAI

 It would not affect this court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal under the Magistrates Ordinance.  There is no point of law involved, and the argument has no chance of success at all. 16.

Whether those assertions can be made good by the plaintiff is a matter for another day.  Prima facie the plaintiff is entitled to choose the defendants to its action, and I am satisfied, given the circumstances and the allegations
which it is intended to make, that Fullbox is a necessary party to these proceedings. 75.  Accordingly, an order in terms of the plaintiff’s summons is to be made joining Fullbox as a party to these proceedings. 76.  There was no discussion of costs at the hearing however there would appear to be no reason, on the face of things, why the usual
orders as to costs should not be made.  Therefore, the costs of the Discharge summons are to be to the plaintiff.  As regards the
Joinder summons, this seeks costs of and occasioned by the application, and the amendment, to be in the cause, and I so order.  However

KOO MING KOWN v. PACIFIC ONLINE LTD [2017] HKCFI 859; HCA 2333/2016 (16 May 2017),"32.  The process of the court must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused.  Hence the court has power under Order 18, rule 19(d) and its inherent jurisdiction to strike
out any proceeding which is an abuse of the process of the court to prevent improper use of its machinery as a means of vexation
and oppression in the process of litigation: see Castro v Murray[12].  To prosecute an action which has absolutely no chance of success is a clear case of abuse of the process of the court.  The court
will strike out proceedings which are absolutely groundless, time-barred (Romex Properties Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd[13]), where the pleading is entirely without substance (Hutchvision Asia Ltd v Asia Television Ltd[14]) or where the plaintiff has no locus standi: see Gurdas S Choithramani v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd[15]. On my finding that the Plaintiff has no locus standi, that the Statement of Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action, and that it is frivolous and vexatious, the action has no chance
of success.  It must necessarily follow that the proceeding is an abuse of the process of the court. 33.  For the above reasons, the Statement of Claim as it now stands or as proposed to be amended in the draft Statement of Claim disclosed
no reasonable cause of action.  That being the case, it would serve no purpose to adjourn the hearing of the Striking Out Summons
to enable the Plaintiff to amend it, or to enable him to obtain evidence as to the falsity of Chan’s academic qualification through
third party discovery.  In any event, it is not necessary at this stage of the proceeding because for the purpose of this appeal,
I proceed on the basis that all the allegations contained in the Statement of Claim and the draft Amended Statement of Claim are
true.  Accordingly, the Statement of Claim must be struck out and the action dismissed. It must necessarily follow that the Adjournment
Summons and Discovery Summons must also be dismissed.  In the circumstances, the costs order made by the Registrar, being one which
follows the event, is appropriate. 34.  For the above reasons, I uphold the order of the Registrar dated 24 February 2017 and dismiss the Plaintiff’s appeal with costs.

to secure the just resolution of disputes in accordance with the substantive rights of the parties.  However, it can be seen that
there was no good explanation offered by the defendants as to their absence from the trial under factors 1 and 2.  Even if all other
factors are decided in favour of the defendants, it will not make a difference to my conclusion.  I decline to order a retrial. 51.  Tanner De Witt has been very fair in issuing the 10 January letter. There was no fault on the part of the plaintiff and she has

and her position is amply reflected in the video recorded interview where she refused to answer questions or give any information.
 It was the defendant’s right to do so and it is only being relied upon as evidence to show her lack of cooperation with and assistance
to the authorities.  The fact that the defendant exercised her right of silence during the course of the video recorded interview
is not being used to draw an adverse inference against her.  It is only being relied upon as evidence of the position that she took
with the Customs Officers at the time of her arrest and detention by them.   30.  At the conclusion of the Newton Hearing, I adjourned the sentence of the defendant to 4:30 pm, 23 May 2017. 31.

RE FORTUNE KING TRADING LTD [2017] HKCFI 890; HCCW 432/2012 (19 May 2017),"41.  I should add that although submissions have been made by both counsel on the validity of the transfer of the one share in the Company
from Alphred to Satisfactory and the Special Resolution approving the transfer, which are the subject matters of the Trustees’
claim in HCA 1055/2012, I have not made any determination on these issues as they fall outside the question raised in the Summons.
 That said, it appears that in the absence of the consent of the Official Receiver, who is the provisional trustee of the estate
of Mr Luu, any purported disposal of the assets of Mr Luu would be invalid and not binding upon the Trustees. 42.  As for costs, I make a costs order nisi that: 43.  I consider it appropriate to order 50% of the costs of Construction to be paid out of the assets of the Company, as the court derives
considerable assistance from the evidence filed by the Trustees in particular the evidence those concerning the Company which should
have been dealt with by the Liquidators.  Indeed, had the Liquidators performed their duty in investigating and making a decision
on the competing claims, the Summons might not have been necessary.  Given that in the ordinary event, the costs incurred by the
Liquidators in investigating and determining the competing claims would be paid out of the assets of the Company, it would be appropriate
to order part of Construction’s costs to be paid out of the assets of the Company.","21/1/2010

and offer to repay the sum in full within 24 hours.  The learned magistrate took into account the fact that the appellant’s family
only received $9,843 each month, decided not to order the appellant to repay in one go.  In my judgment, it cannot be reasonably
argued that the learned magistrate sentenced the appellant to an immediate term of imprisonment because she had not repaid the overpayment
in full. 66.  In my judgment, taken into consideration the seven factors and the three sentencing principles discussed in the preceding paragraphs,
bearing in mind in particular the hitherto clear record, the physical disability and the family difficulties of the appellant, the
interest of justice is best served by suspending the sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for a period of 2 years. 67.  I allow the appellant’s appeal against sentence.  The sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment is varied to the extent that it is

Children remaining in Hong Kong after the Removal and for some reasons, he then changed his mind.  He made no attempt to have any
contact with the Children since the Removal.  The Children now both object to return to Korea. The Son is of an age and maturity
which this court should take into account his views.  Even if the Daughter may not be, it was not suggested that she should return
without her brother.  The Children are now both well settled in Hong Kong and I find it is not in their best interest for them to
be up-rooted again. I thus exercise my discretion and decline to order the return of the Children to Korea. 177.  I will make no orders as to costs, save that the Mother’s own costs be taxed under legal aid regulations.  This is an order nisi,

to have said that he would like the matter to be left until the direction referred to in [12] had been issued.  28.  In [38] of their judgment the Court of Appeal state that if the MOF really intended to impose sanctions for any breach of an instruction,
they would have set this out in writing.  The present position is no different in that regard from when the matter was before the
Court of Appeal on 3 April 2017.  There is no written instruction or statement from the MOF stating that copies of the documents
should not be provided and that if they are the MOF may instigate some form of disciplinary action against KPMG Huazhen.  All the
Court has been provided with is Mr Jen’s apparent understanding of what Director Wang would like to happen. 29.  It seems to me that in order for KPMG Hong Kong to succeed in the present application it is necessary for them to demonstrate that
something has taken place since the hearing of the appeal, which materially alters the position that was before the Court of Appeal.

LEUNG WAI HOK v. SECRETARIAT ON CIVIL SERVICE DISCIPLINE [2017] HKCFI 899; HCAL 36/2017 (22 May 2017),"6.  It is well recognised that judicial review is an exceptional remedy that should only be employed in the most appropriate cases.
Simply because decisions or actions emanate from a body performing public law duties or powers, is not enough to justify invoking
the judicial review jurisdiction.  There must be a public law element with sufficient substance and importance to it to justify judicial
review.  This was strongly expressed by the Court of Final Appeal back in 2003 in the decision of Financial Secretary v Wong [2003] HKCFA 9;  (2003) 6 HKCFAR 476.  Bokhary PJ (as he then was) stressed that judicial review was not meant for micromanaging and that it should hardly ever be exercised
to review decisions that went only to procedure rather than the end result.[1]  In a separate judgment, Litton NPJ also stressed that judicial review was the means by which judicial control of administrative
action could be exercised and that not every decision by a decision maker was susceptible to review.  He explained that the essential
quality of a reviewable decision was that it was a substantive determination.[2]  He quoted the comments of Mason CJ (as he then was) in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33;  (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 337 that: 7.  More recently, Au J in Television Broadcasts Ltd v Communications Authority & Anor [2013] HKCFI 772; [2013] 5 HKC 593 laid emphasis on the special and exclusive nature of the judicial review jurisdiction.  He explained in some detail that save in
exceptional circumstances, judicial review should only focus on the ultimate action or decision which had substantive legal consequences
or final binding legal effect.[3]  He further explained that a court would adopt a strict approach in deciding whether or not to entertain a judicial review of intermediary
or preparatory steps in the decision making process of the executive branch of government and of statutory bodies and tribunals.[4] He then set out six governing principles when a court may entertain challenges of intermediary or preparatory steps in a judicial
review which essentially reflect that the jurisdiction would only be invoked in relation to substantive decisions or actions where
there is an important public law issue.[5]  8.  The application is therefore refused. ","Date of Decision: 22 May 2017(Kevin Zervos)

In support of the view above he said: 12.  As it is, there will be at least two trials taking place in which the defendant and the complainant are the same. If Mr Tracey were
to succeed in his primary submission, there would be three. These parents will, regardless of the outcome of these proceedings, need
to find a way forward which will, as far as possible, resolve the matters between them but which will also expedite a relationship
which will cause as little harm to the children of the family as possible.  No matter what the outcome, the defendant is still the
father of two young girls. There is considerable prejudice to the children of this marriage the longer these proceedings take to
come to a resolution.  I do not accept that the prejudice to the complainant can be minimised by the use of the screen; the relative
shortness of two or three trials rather than one long one or the institution of the Family Court injunction.  Each separate trial
adds pressure upon both the defendant and the complainant and, most importantly, the children. Nor is it in the interest of justice
to have several small and distinct trials which cause greater pressure upon the public purse than one longer one, as experience shows
that they are likely, cumulatively, to take up more time and not less.  My discretion must be exercised taking into account all these
factors and balancing them fairly as between the parties. 13.  The current valid indictment is to be severed. I give leave  for the prosecution to prefer two fresh indictments, one containing
the criminal intimidation charges under Counts 1 and 3 to7 of the current indictment and one containing Counts  2 and 8.   This matter
will proceed initially upon Counts  2 and 8 as reflected in the fresh indictment presumably re drafted as Counts 1 to 2 i.e. the
 indecent assault of 10 June 2016 and the rape on 30 July 2016.  The second indictment containing the counts of criminal intimidation
will remain in the High Court to be listed thereafter for trial if the defendant is found guilty upon either of the indecent assault
or the rape charges so that the same tribunal will be in a position to sentence him for all matters once the remaining charges of
criminal intimidation have been dealt with by jury trial if they are proceeded with.  If the defendant is found not guilty of all
of the charges on the first trial, I give leave for the prosecution to apply to have the criminal intimidation charges transferred
to a lower court to be dealt with and a further hearing will be fixed to hear that matter if it becomes necessary.","Date of Reasons for Decision: 22 May 2017(A P Campbell‑Moffat)

HKSAR v. TSIM HIU YEE [2017] HKCFI 903; HCCC 423/2016 (23 May 2017),"14.  It has been acknowledged as part of the sentencing regime for trafficking in dangerous drugs that the involvement of an international
element is an aggravating factor calling for the enhancement of the starting point.  I have addressed the issue where the drug concerned
is ketamine in HKSAR v Chan Ka-yiu, HCCC 143/2015, 19 May 2016, unreported, at paragraphs 18 to 39.  I will enhance the sentence in the present case by 6 months’
imprisonment.  The starting point currently stands at 12 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.   15.  At the time of the defendant’s arrest, she cooperated with the Customs officers.  This was acknowledged by the Customs officers
at trial.  She participated in a series of controlled delivery operations and later answered questions in a video recorded interview.
 Although the controlled delivery operations were not successful, the fact remains that she cooperated and assisted Customs officers
in the further investigation of this case.  She made a number of phone and WhatsApp messages to the person she claimed was to collect
the parcel and to the person who arranged the delivery. She participated in three controlled delivery operations.  On the issue of
assistance to the authorities, I have not held against her the fact that she sent a message to a friend and deleted messages.  She
revealed both matters to Customs officers when asked about them.  I will therefore reduce her sentence for the assistance that she
rendered the authorities by 9 months.  This brings the starting point to 11 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.  16.  For the foregoing reasons, I sentence the defendant to 11 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.

sum of RMB 130 million to be paid to Samson.  The issue is whether an order for damages to be assessed should be given in light of
the absence of any evidence at this trial. 118.  Based on the evidence and arguments before the court, Samson should not be entitled to the return of the RMB 130 million in its
primary prayer for relief.  Samson is the beneficial owner of the 3% shareholding in CNTG BVI in return for its RMB 130 million investment.
 Whilst the misrepresentation may have caused Samson to make such investment, on balance, in the light of his willingness to acquire
0.5% interest at RMB 30 million in the absence of the Buyback Representation and in the absence of evidence to ascertain the value
of the 3% shareholding, the relief sought by Samson for damages to be assessed is dismissed.  The defendants pointed out that the
monetary disputes regarding the use of funds and the value of the business is dealt with in the BVI proceeding.  The BVI proceeding
is the proper forum for such quantification and valuation exercise to be done.  The 2nd plaintiff has failed to establish that an order be granted for damages to be assessed in this action. 119.  Costs should follow the event and the defendants are to bear and pay the plaintiffs’ costs, to be taxed if not agreed.","Dates of Hearing: 25 – 29 July, 1 – 5 and 8 – 11 August 2016Date of Judgment: 23 May 2017","(Teresa Cheng SC)

MICHAEL YAP AND ANOTHER v. LAI YIP DYEING FACTORY LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1060; HCA 1084/2011 (23 May 2017),"24. Having considered Ps’ grounds and for the reasons above, I am not satisfied that Ps are able to discharge this burden.  As such,
Ds must be given leave to amend their respective Defence and Counterclaim.  So I order. 25. As to the costs of this application and the costs for the hearing today, Ps ask for costs for the reasons that Ds have made some
mistakes on their amended cases.  They have accepted that Leung Ting Kuen should not be pleaded and that the proportion of the shareholding
is not correct.  They are also late in their application, almost six years from the claim being first launched.  Ds did not file
their supporting affidavits in support of their application.  The supporting affidavits were filed and served about five months later.
The 2nd affirmation of Chung Lim Tung was wrongly described.  It should be the first affirmation.  This has wasted Ps’ time for clarification.
 This Court will certainly take all the factors into consideration as provided under O.62, r.5 RHC.  But all these factors do not
change the general legal principle that the costs should follow the event. Only the quantum of costs should be affected.  Overall,
Ds are successful in their application for amendment of their respective Defence and Counterclaim.  The costs of and occasioned by
the application will be given to the Ps, to be taxed if not agreed, by Ds.  The costs of today’s hearing, together with the costs
reserved should be to Ds.  Taking into consideration of the circumstances as described above, Ds will have only 75% of the costs.
 The assessed costs are $49,500 to be paid by Ps to Ds (with certificate for counsel) within 14 days from the date hereof. 26. This Court shall now make an order in terms as follows:",Date of Decision: 23 May 2017(K. W. Lung),"Registrar, High Court",/2017/1060.html,"

RE CHINA FISHERY GROUP LTD [2017] HKCFI 1815; HCCW 367/2015 (23 May 2017),"7.  HSBC argues that the Companies’ conduct in securing the abandonment of the appeal by entering into a settlement, material parts
of which were contained in an express undertaking to this Court,  when the management of the Companies had already formed the intention
not to comply with material parts of the undertaking was an affront to the Court and in these circumstances it was appropriate for
this Court to signify its displeasure with the Companies’ conduct by ordering costs on an indemnity basis: see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2017, vol 1, para 62/App/12.  HSBC further argues that it is not necessary for the Court to conclude that it was likely that this would
have been sufficient to lead to the dismissal of the summonses, it is sufficient for the Court to take note of the Companies’ conduct
and, if it forms the view the conduct is sufficiently reprehensible, to order costs on a higher basis. 8.  It is clear from Judge Garrity’s findings in his decision of 28 October 2016 that the Judge has found as a fact that the Companies’
management gave undertakings to this Court that at the time they did not intend to comply with.  This is, of course, unacceptable
and does represent an affront to the Court.  I am satisfied that in the circumstances it is appropriate to order costs on an indemnity
basis including the costs of today and I so order. 9.  As I have mentioned there is an application made to the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, by the United
States trustee for an order that documents including those sought in the summonses in these proceedings be provided to him.  As matters
currently stand neither party is able to use the documents for any purpose other than the conduct of these proceedings.  It seems
to me that before any of the parties release the documents they should first obtain an order of this Court.  If the Court in New
York considers that it is desirable that they are released to the United States trustee this is a matter to which I would have regard
and, if it were considered helpful, the parties can consider a protocol for expediting this process.  They might have regard to the

have another bite at the cherry.  In these circumstances, it is plainly right for the OR to require the Bankrupt to satisfy her of
the merits of the intended actions, as well as to provide an indemnity for the OR’s costs liability which may arise from such actions,
before giving any consent.  None of these requirements have been met. 6. I am unable to see any merit in this application, and the Bankrupt’s Summons dated 8 August 2016 must be dismissed. I shall hear

proposed added particulars substantially caused the death of the deceased, the delay in the application for amendment would have
caused injustice to the defence.  The particulars of the original indictment had nothing to do with “post-infusion management”.
 The inclusion of the proposed new particulars would have necessitated the defence team to shift or to re-focus their case to meet
the added allegation.  Whilst an adjournment would have given the defence time to prepare, in view of the fact that this case was
set down back in 2016, it would have been extremely difficult to find new trial dates should there be an adjournment. 38.  In any event, Mr Wong had clearly indicated that D1 would not ask for an adjournment as justice delay is justice denied.  Mr Duncan
did not ask for an adjournment either.  Had I allowed the application to amend, the defence team of D1 and D3 would have been forced
to deal with the new area while the trial is going on.  It would have been most unfair to the defence. 39.  For these reasons, I refused the application of the prosecution to amend the indictment.","MAK Wan-ling

suffers from dementia with psychotic features.  She concluded: “He had severe cognitive impairment and the condition is not likely
to improve in the near future given the progressive nature of dementia.”  In her expert medical opinion, she recommended a Hospital
Order of unspecified period under section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.  She suggested that the defendant could serve his sentence in Castle Peak Hospital where provision has been provided for him. 13.  I am satisfied on the evidence of the two psychiatrists that it is necessary in the interests and welfare of the defendant and for
the protection of others that the defendant be admitted to a mental hospital in accordance with section 76(2)(a) and Schedule 4 of
the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.  As suggested by the two psychiatrists appropriate provision has and can be provided to the defendant at Castle Peak Hospital. 14.

very high, and the enhancement for the international element may bring the sentence to a level where it is not just and proportionate
to the overall culpability of the offender’s conduct, I impose a starting point of 24 years’ imprisonment which I will reduce
by 29 percent for the defendant’s plea of guilty to 17 years’ imprisonment.  As I have already noted, the one third discount
was reduced to 29 percent for the unsuccessful Newton hearing. 39.

HKSAR v. KWOK WING [2017] HKCFI 937; HCCC 217/2014 (25 May 2017),"188.  Mr Reading submitted that the defendant is impecunious.  He noted that the defendant was declared bankrupt in 2009 and discharged
in 2013, and that there are proceedings against him by the Securities and Futures Commission for repayment of the $26 million the
subject of Count 1.  He submits he has no money and no property in Hong Kong or elsewhere.  I do not accept this to be the case.
 He has been able to afford a team of lawyers, including senior counsel, throughout these proceedings.  From what I have before me,
substantial funds ended up in the defendant’s hands and bearing in mind the way he has carried out his criminal misdeeds through
corporate structures and nominees here and aboard, I am not of the view that he is impecunious as he claims.  In fact, from what
I have before me, it appears that substantial funds ended up with the defendant which had been transferred overseas.  189.  In my view, the stay application was wrongly brought.  There had not been full and proper compliance with section 65DA of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, Cap 221, where the defence were obliged to provide a copy of the documents or materials on which their expert based his opinion
or findings.  Furthermore, it appeared to me that documents were in the possession of the defence which on their face did not support
their application, and which had not been disclosed.  190.  The unnecessary and improper act or omission by or on behalf of the defendant was the bringing of the stay application when it was
clearly devoid of merit, and where documents were in possession of the defendant that did not support his application, and were not
disclosed by him.  I therefore order that the defendant pay the prosecution costs of and in relation to the stay application, to

Further, at the hearing of closing submission, I asked Ms Leong if it is possible for the 2nd defendant to make any sanctioned payment pursuant to Order 22 RHC with a view to protecting her interest concerning the question
of costs, she made no submission in this regard.  In the circumstances, I refuse to exercise my discretion in favour of the 2nd defendant and make the order that: 62.  Pursuant to my order dated 16 November 2016, I reserved the question of costs as between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant regarding
the plaintiff's summons dated 3 November 2016, and the plaintiff's solicitors have given their undertaking not to claim such costs
against the plaintiff and the Director of Legal Aid.  As discussed with Mr Lin for the plaintiff at the hearing on 16 November 2016,
I am of the view that the costs of the plaintiff's summons dated 3 November 2016 were incurred as a result of the improper act or
omission on the part of the plaintiff's solicitors and that it is appropriate for this court to make a wasted costs order against
the plaintiff's solicitors personally on its own motion under Order 62 rule 8A RHC.  I now make an order nisi that the costs as between
the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant regarding the plaintiff's summons dated 3 November 2016 including the hearing on 16 November 2016 be paid by the plaintiff's
solicitors personally to the 2nd defendant with certificate for counsel, to be taxed if not agreed, which shall become absolute unless any of the parties apply to

the Indian Police “of no assistance” and only “generic in nature” confused the issues of state protection and acquiescence
with the issue of whether the applicant had demonstrated a genuine and substantive risk that he would personally be at risk of harm
if refouled.  The question of protection by the police was also addressed by TCAB and at para 42, TCAB found that it could not be
said that the police acquiesced simply because it did not further investigate when the applicant could not identify the attackers.
 It cannot be said that TCAB had failed to consider properly or analyse the issue of extended acquiescence nor can it be argued that
the finding on this issue is Wednesbury unreasonable. 20.  So for all the above reasons, I set aside the ex parte leave and this application for judicial review is dismissed. 21.

ZHU LI v. THE LAW SOCIETY OF HONG KONG [2017] HKCFI 961; [2017] 3 HKLRD 513; HCAL 8/2014 (31 May 2017),"98.  I have given the question of costs anxious consideration.  The applicant by this application has caused the Law Society to reconsider
its decision and to investigate her complaint as she had initially sought.  She has nevertheless continued her challenge, and refined
her grounds of review.  She has unfortunately at times used extreme language and made unsubstantiated allegations in advancing her
grounds of review.  Her allegations against the Law Society of collusion and bias in relation to this complaint were unsubstantiated,
and quite frankly without foundation, bearing in mind the structure and the composition of the Council and the manner in which it
conducts its affairs and business.  99.  From my assessment of the case, I have no doubt that the Law Society initially stood its ground on principle but later in a genuine
effort to resolve the dispute with the applicant agreed to reconsider its decision.  The applicant has succeeded in identifying an
anomaly in the complaint handling procedures when a complaint is made against a Council member.  The Law Society has addressed the
matter in the present case, and no doubt it has general guidelines concerning conflict of interest and procedures for declaring an
interest in relation to its ordinary affairs and business.  It would seem to me that the Law Society needs to specifically address
this issue with appropriate guidelines and measures. However, the applicant has not been successful in advancing arguments against
the “fresh investigation”, and unfortunately has resorted to making allegations against the Law Society that are without foundation. 100.  Therefore, on the question of costs, I am inclined to award the applicant 60 percent of her costs. Such costs would be limited because
the applicant has acted in person but in any event she may have incurred costs of some sort.  I therefore make an order nisi that
the Law Society pay 60 percent of the applicant’s costs, to be taxed if not agreed.",Date of Hearing: 16 December 2016Date of Judgment: 31 May 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

DR LAU YUE CHIU v. LAU KIN SHUN FREEMAN [2017] HKCFI 963; HCMP 1176/2016 (31 May 2017),"117.  I am unable to understand the relevance of the above proposition. This reflected misunderstanding as to administration of the estate
and the order of priority. The latter is governed by rule 19 of the NCPR which is quite irrespective of whether or not the beneficial
interest in a residuary gift has fallen in upon administration of the estate. The suggestion that a residuary legatee/devisee cannot
seek a grant of representation because he has no beneficial interest before administration of the estate is complete would render
rule 19(ii)-(iv) of the NCPR would be meaningless. The whole purpose of seeking a grant of representation is to enable the estate
to be properly administered and distributed, so it is strange that the residuary legatee/devisee cannot seek such grant under rule
19 of the NCPR before the estate is administered and he acquires beneficial interest. By that time, he does not need a grant any
more. 118.  By reason of the above matters, the answer to the Priority Issue is plainly and obviously that upon the death of Lau Yue Kui, former
administrator of the Estate, LA with will annexed de bonis non in respect of the Estate should have been granted to D as a matter of priority, and P did not come within the categories under rule
19 of the NCPR. That being the case, P’s claim against D in the OS must be struck out and dismissed, and I so order. There is therefore
no need for any further directions hearing for the OS referred to in paragraph 12(e) above. 119.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. However, I bear in mind the Removal Issue was not considered at the Hearing
of the Summons, and I also note the further concerns referred to in Part II above. I therefore grant a costs order nisi as follows:","7th fong

On the question of costs, by reason of section 43(1)-(2) of the HCO and Order 62 rule 3(12) of the RHC, the starting point is that the person against whom pre-action discovery is sought (eg D) is entitled to a costs order in his favour. But it had been said that “[where] the person against
whom an order is sought is at fault, eg where he has been dilatory in replying to a proper request to disclose documents, the court
may deny him his costs, or, in exceptional cases, order him to pay the applicant’s costs of the application”.[37] 57.  Here, NF made 2 requests to D on 17 May 2016 and 10 March 2017 for the Requested Documents, but there was no reply from him. D even
filed notice of intention to defend after the OS was served on him, but did not file any evidence in opposition. At the Hearing,
he also raised objection to the reliefs sought in the OS. In the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to grant a costs order
nisi that (a) there be no order as to costs of and occasioned by the OS (including all costs reserved if any), and (b) P’s own costs

CHEN LIAN TING v. ZHANG QIN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 999; HCA 2273/2016 (31 May 2017),"16.  I may add that the view of BVI law taken in Waddington seems to be consistent with the decision of Eder J of the BVI High Court in Iu Chung v Greater Achieve Ltd (Claim No BVIHC (Com) 140 of 2015) on 28 June 2016.  In that case, the company in which the plaintiffs held shares and its direct
wholly‑owned subsidiary whose assets were allegedly misappropriated by the wrongdoers were both BVI companies.  The statement of
claim pleading a double derivative claim was struck out on various grounds.  The relevant ground for present purposes was stated
in paras 15 and 16 of the decision, where Eder J said: 17.  It seems to me that the judge had at least assumed that a double derivative action was possible in BVI law.  The source of the requirement
of permission referred to by Eder J is not clear from the decision and (assuming it is not s 184C) it is at least arguable that it
is a procedural requirement not applicable to a multiple derivative action brought in Hong Kong. 18.  For these reasons, I conclude that the 2nd defendant has not shown that it is plain and obvious that multiple derivative actions are not permissible in BVI law or that to bring
a multiple derivative action in relation to HK Wise Park it is necessary as a matter of substantive law for the plaintiff to obtain
the prior permission of the BVI High Court.  The application to strike out must therefore be dismissed.","TOP SUPER RESOURCES LIMITED

L v. X LTD [2017] HKCFI 1043; HCMP 1002/2017 (31 May 2017),"3. The Company raises by its summons a point of principle.  This can be explained most readily by quoting the question of law that the
summons seeks to have determined: 4. It is not practical for that issue or for the other matters which the originating summons requires to be determined to be resolved
today.  The parties have agreed that the timing problem, by which I mean the fact that it will not be possible to determine the originating
summons and the inter-parte summons before it is suggested the limitation period will expire, should be addressed by an order granting leave to issue the writ
without determining the originating summons against an undertaking by the applicant to withdraw the writ which will not be served
in the event that the respondent is successful either on its inter‑parte summons or in defeating the originating summons on some other ground. 5. Because there is some confidentiality in this matter the names of the parties will be redacted but as this is an issue which is likely

HKSAR v. KO CHI-YIP [2017] HKCFI 968; HCCC 65/2017 (1 June 2017),"10.  The response from Mr Wright is that whilst the evidence of the WhatsApp messages was served late, it is not material in the circumstances
of the case to the discount to be afforded to the defendant following his plea of guilty.  I agree with Mr Wright’s submission.
 11.  The WhatsApp messages were clearly known to the defendant and there was always the possibility of them being relied upon by the
prosecution in the case against him.  The defendant made an informed choice to enter a plea of not guilty which he maintained until
after his case was listed for trial.  He was aware of the WhatsApp messages and of his involvement in the crime to which he has admitted.
  The issue in relation to the discount he is to receive is dependent upon the stage of the proceedings that he has entered his plea
of guilty.  A sentencing court has an overriding discretion but there has to be very good reason to adjust the percentage discounts
from those now laid down in Ngo Van Nam.  I see no reason not to follow Ngo Van Nam, and accordingly in the circumstances of this case I will afford the defendant a discount of 25 percent.  12.  As I have noted, the starting point is 13 years and 3 months’ imprisonment which I will reduce by 25 percent to 9 years and 10
months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 1 June 2017Date of Sentence: 1 June 2017,(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/968.html,"

FENG LISHE v. XU ZHIQIANG [2017] HKCFI 970; HCA 2178/2015 (1 June 2017),"60.  Xu has submitted skeleton bills of costs in both Actions.  In the 2178 Action, he asks for security for costs in the sum of HK$624,541.66,
and in the 2543 Action, he asks for HK$1,063,600, both up to and including the Case Management Conference.  Taking a broad brush
approach, and noting that the two actions are now consolidated so that one set of costs would be incurred for most items in future,
I shall fix the quantum at HK$320,000 in the 2178 Action, and HK$500,000 in the 2543 Action, to be paid by Feng and China Art respectively

RE TANG YAT CHEUNG [2017] HKCFI 1431; HCB 5436/2014 (1 June 2017),"10.  The trustees also allowed him rent in the sum of $4,500, despite that he is living rent free in his wife’s accommodation.  That
would have allowed him to contribute to his wife’s mortgage repayment, if any, or provided him something to give to his wife as
a loving gesture from a dutiful husband for sharing in her flat. 11.  On the whole, I consider the trustees’ approach of the trustees unreproachable.  They promised to reassess the allowance and to
consider any reasonable ad hoc expenses on production of documentary evidence. In my view, the allowance is reasonable for a person
who has a financial burden to bear.  But, in all fairness to the bankrupt, the allowance may not be as generous as a person of his
income would like to be restrained from spending.  However, if one unfortunately becomes a bankrupt, when managing his financial
affairs, he must bear in mind the principle that one must be just before generous. He has not been prudent in managing his financial
affairs which landed him in bankruptcy.  By reason of the bankruptcy proceedings, his debts are forgiven.  He is allowed to begin
his financial affairs afresh, while his creditors are made to suffer for his impecuniosity.  But all that the law requires of him
is to subject himself to some discipline in his financial management for a few years, pay what he can reasonably afford to pay like
a responsible adult and to instill in himself a sense of responsibility in his financial affairs so that he would not fall again.
 If he is to be allowed to keep and spend all his income and to contribute only a nominal amount to repay his debt, it would be unjust
to his creditors.  Hence, I consider the expenses assessed by the trustees reasonable. 12.  However, in the present case, the bankrupt has found a new employment which almost doubled his past income.  He should be encouraged
to take a more positive attitude in life by being allowed to keep some of the fruits of his effort.  While the trustees have allowed
him $1,900, I think there is room for further increase as the position of the creditors has improved in the past two years as a result
of his effort.  I would therefore revise his monthly allowance to $16,000, but only with immediate effect.  To increase beyond that
level would be unjust to the creditors.","Management fee

HKSAR v. ZHENG YICUN [2017] HKCFI 976; HCCC 132/2017 (2 June 2017),"2.  The defendant has admitted that on 13 September 2016 he unlawfully trafficked in a dangerous drug, namely 288 g of a crystalline
solid containing 280 g of methamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as Ice, by bringing the drugs into Hong Kong at the Lok Ma
Chau Control Point.  The estimated retail value of the drugs at the time of the offence was $104,544.  He was stopped by police officers
who searched him and found the drugs secreted in a pocket of his underpants.  He admitted to the police officers that on that day
he had been given the Ice by a person named Ah Hing in Haifeng in mainland China who told him to wear the underpants so as to conceal
the Ice and take it to Shui Yeh in Hong Kong.  He explained that he owed Ah Hing $7,000 who suggested to him that he could set off
$5,000 of the amount that he owed him by making the delivery of the drugs.  He agreed to do it.  He also admitted that he has been
taking Ice for about half a year prior to this offence. 3.  The defendant is 33 years of age.  He was born in Haifeng in mainland China.  I am told that his family moved to Hong Kong in 1997.
 He later joined them about 3 years ago.  He has attained secondary school education to Form 3 level in mainland China.  At the time
of the offence he was living with his family and employed as a jewelry worker.  The defendant is married with a six-month old son.
 His wife and child live in mainland China.  It appears he maintains two homes, one in Hong Kong and one in mainland China.  He has
a clear record in Hong Kong.  4.  According to the sentencing guideline cases of AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125 and HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691, for trafficking in Ice, a starting point for a quantity of 280 g of Ice within the indicated tariff band is 14 years and 8 months’
imprisonment.  There is also an international element due to the fact that the defendant brought drugs into Hong Kong from mainland
China.  As provided by HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKC 197 and HKSAR v Chung Ping Kun, CACC 85/2014, 2 July 2014, this warrants an enhancement on the defendant’s sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment.  This brings
the starting point to 15 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.  As the defendant is entitled to a full one third discount, I will reduce
his sentence to 10 years’ imprisonment. ",vZHENG Yicun (鄭壹村),(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/976.html,"

the contempt proceedings will be used by him to harass Chan prior to the conclusion of this action.  It cannot be allowed.  I have
been referred to the case of GB Minerals Holdings Ltd v Short [2015] EWHC 1387 (TCC).  It involved rather different facts and should be distinguished.  In particular, the Averments here are not significant. 23.  For these reasons, this application is declined. 24.  It should be made clear that the proposed amendment to the Contempt Statement as well as Koo’s 7th affirmation have been considered in the determination of this application.  For proper housekeeping, I make an order in terms of
para 1 of the ex parte Summons filed on 25 May 2017.  The filing of the Amended Statement be dispensed with, and I make no order

SARAS GOPI v. BINA DEEGAN [2017] HKCFI 978; HCA 3075/2015 (2 June 2017),"23.  For these reasons, I have concluded that the terms of the charge proposed by Mrs Gopi (with the words “upon completion of the
trial of [the] action” in clause 9.1.4 being replaced by “following the conclusion of the action”) will enable Mrs Deegan to
enforce the charge without too much difficulty or the need for further litigation if Mrs Gopi fails to comply with any orders for
costs until the action has been set down for trial, up to a maximum of $2,000,000.00, on condition that, within 28 days of this ruling, 24.  At present I see no reason why Mrs Deegan should not be required to pay the bulk of Mrs Gopi’s costs relating to the issues which
this ruling has addressed.  It is true that the language of clause 9.1.4 has to be altered in one minor respect, but I did not regard
that as necessary.  It is also true that I have only approved the charge proposed by Mrs Gopi subject to certain conditions, but
I have rejected most of the objections raised on behalf of Mrs Deegan.  In particular, I have rejected the core point made on her
behalf that Form CH1 was inappropriate, and that what was required was a deed of charge.  My current thinking is that the fairest
order to make is that Mrs Deegan must pay to Mrs Gopi 60% of her costs incurred in respect of the issues which this ruling has addressed,
limited to those costs incurred from 14 days after the draft charge was first sent to Mrs Deegan’s solicitors for their approval,
those costs to be taxed if not agreed, but not to be paid until the conclusion of the action.  I make an order nisi to that effect. 25.  I conclude with two observations.  First, I was left with the distinct impression that Mrs Deegan’s solicitors regretted agreeing
to the security being provided by a charge over Mrs Gopi’s flat, and they therefore took every point which was available to them,
however unmeritorious the point might be, to persuade the court to resile from what the parties had agreed, and to revert to the
usual order that security for costs be provided by a payment into court.  The difficulty with that is that the court was obliged
to give effect to what the parties had agreed, provided that it provided Mrs Deegan with sufficient security for her costs.  Secondly,
the resolution of the issue to which this application relates has resulted in the expenditure of very considerable legal costs, which
many people would think were wholly disproportionate to the minor issue at stake.  The parties would, I think, be well advised to
think long and hard before engaging in costly skirmishes which will only result in further depleting family assets.","Dates of Written Submissions: 31 March, 7 April and 12 April 2017Date of Handing Down Ruling: 2 June 2017","(Brian Keith)

necessary that Hunter promptly commence FX derivative proceedings in Hong Kong, and that steps be taken to resolve the “crystallisation

engagement of two counsel although I note that both parties were represented by two counsel at the hearing on 15 May 2017.  I grant
counsel certificate for one counsel only. 20. In the premise, I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs for the Summons on indemnity basis up to 18 October 2016 and
thereafter on party-and-party basis with certificate for one counsel.  Such costs will be assessed by summary assessment by way of
paper disposal and payable forthwith after the assessment. 21. The plaintiff has submitted her statement of costs.  I direct the defendant to send to the court his comments (if any) on the plaintiff’s

for the plaintiff to rectify the pleadings.  She was to lodge the draft on or before 24 February 2017.  By the hearing on 11 May
2017, there was a delay of about 3 months.  In all fairness to the 1st defendant, further delay would create pressure and injustice to the defendant when they could not fully understand how to defend
the case.  Unless special reason could be shown, there should be no reason to allow the application for an extension of time.  I
am not satisfied that there was any special reason. 21. In conclusion, I refuse to extend the time for the plaintiff to lodge her draft amended statement of claim.  Since I refuse the application,
there could be only one conclusion, namely that the statement of claim against the 1st defendant should be struck off.  The action against the 1st Defendant should also be dismissed with costs of the action, including the costs of the striking out summons and the hearing on 23
November 2016, 18 April 2017 and 11 May 2017 be to the 1st defendant. Counsel certificate is granted to the 1st and 2nd defendants for the hearing on 23 November 2016. 22.

SH v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1814; [2017] 6 HKC 22; HCAL 59/2015 (6 June 2017),"33.  I tend to agree with Mr Hew that not any fresh evidence raised on appeal would call for an oral hearing.  It all depends on whether,
in the mind of the Adjudicator, further probing is necessary and whether such so‑called fresh evidence is just more or less the
same as what was advanced before the Director.  In the present case, whilst the “new evidence” ground on its own may not succeed,
I am of the view that since the Adjudicator found against the applicant’s credibility which led him to conclude that the applicant’s
claim was unsubstantiated, the high standards of fairness required by Prabakar call for the Adjudicator to give the applicant an opportunity at an oral hearing to deal with those matters which were troubling
in his mind, before he decided the petition. 34.  In the absence of oral hearing before the Adjudicator, I find that there was a failure to meet the high standard of fairness.  I
allow SH’s application for judicial review against the Board’s decision but reject his application in respect of the Director’s
decision.  I grant a certiorari to quash the decision of the TCAB and order the matter be remitted to the TCAB for re‑consideration by another Adjudicator.  I
also direct the case to be heard expeditiously. 35.  I make an order nisi that the Director and the Board shall pay 50% of SH’s costs of these proceedings, to be taxed on a party to party basis if not
agreed, with certificate for counsel.  The deduction is made on the basis that the application in respect of the Board succeeded
but failed in respect of the Director.  The applicant’s own costs to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.",(M Poon)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1814.html,"

that on an appeal the claimant was barred from adducing new evidence such as a new translation of any question and answer, but there
is nothing to stop the claimant from at least identifying the evidence which he said was misinterpreted so that the court could assess
the materiality of that evidence. 33.  For these reasons I do not think the third ground is arguable at all. 34.  The claimant’s application for leave to appeal must accordingly be dismissed.

HKSAR v. KONG YUEN PING [2017] HKCFI 1012; HCCC 153/2017 (8 June 2017),"13.  Mr Bernard Yuen, counsel for the defendant, has urged me to sentence the defendant in relation to the two counts to which he has
pleaded guilty by ordering that the sentences on each be served concurrently.  He has drawn my attention to three cases, HKSAR v Ip Yuet Ho, CACC 455/2007, 4 July 2008, unreported; HKSAR v Lo Kwong Yin, CACC 223/2008, 5 October 2012, unreported; and HKSAR v X, CACC 109/2011, 8 February 2012, unreported.  In each case, the sentences imposed on manufacturing and trafficking offences were
ordered to be served concurrently. None of the cases provides any statement of principle, and clearly the sentences that were imposed
turned on the particular facts of the case.  Each case will be different and the question of sentence will be a matter of applying
the relevant principles to the particular facts of the case in question. 14.  From the nature and scale of the operation in the present case, the defendant had been manufacturing crack cocaine in considerable
quantities and capable of being done on a regular basis.  This is evident from the range of paraphernalia and materials that were
uncovered at the defendant’s premises as well as traces of cocaine that was found in various items, including the air conditioning
unit.  Whilst it was not a sophisticated operation, the scale of production was significant and was capable of manufacturing drugs
on a constant basis.  It appears this manufacturing station was controlled and operated by the defendant and his culpability is therefore
high.  I will adopt a starting point of 15 years’ imprisonment which I will reduced by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea
to 10 years’ imprisonment. 15.  Taking into account the totality principle, I would order that 3 years of the sentence on the manufacturing offence run consecutively
to the sentence on the trafficking offence, thus resulting in a sentence that the defendant is to serve of 14 years’ imprisonment.","Date of Sentence: 8 June 2017(Kevin Zervos)

HKSAR v. LEE SHING PO [2017] HKCFI 1013; HCCC 167/2016 (8 June 2017),"9.  I have borne in mind the principles laid out in HKSAR v Wong Suet Hau & Anor [2002] HKCA 183; [2002] 1 HKLRD 69 in deciding whether any of the drugs were for the defendant’s self-consumption.  I am satisfied that the defendant has had a history
of drug addiction and was likely a user of Ice at the time of the offence.  I am not satisfied, however, that any or some of the
drugs found in his possession were for self-consumption.  Given the circumstances in which the defendant was apprehended, in a public
place in the early hours of the morning with the drugs packaged in 5 plastic bags tucked in his trouser pocket, that this was for
the purpose of trafficking in the drugs in their entirety.  Whilst the defendant may have an addiction to Ice, it does not necessarily
follow that these drugs would be used to satisfy his craving for them.  I have also taken into account that no consumption equipment
was found at his home and it may be that he had access to consumption equipment and drugs elsewhere.   10.  I find that in the circumstances of this case, none of the drugs found in his possession were for self-consumption, and were instead
for the purpose of trafficking in them.  I will therefore make no allowance for self-consumption.  11.  The guideline tariffs for trafficking in Ice, on conviction after trial, are contained in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691.  The guideline starting point for this quantity of drugs is 11 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.  This will be reduced by one third
for the defendant’s guilty plea to 7 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Date of Sentence: 8 June 2017(Kevin Zervos)

TNB FUEL SERVICES SDN BHD v. CHINA NATIONAL COAL GROUP CORPORATION [2017] HKCFI 1016; [2017] 3 HKC 588; HCCT 23/2015 (8 June 2017),"91.  Professor Lin highlights the fact that the Shares (in HK Co) are registered, in accordance with the Interim Administrative Measures
for the Registration of Property Rights of State-invested Enterprises, to argue that this demonstrates that the Shares are state-owned
assets as well. However, as can be seen from the “Enterprise Property Right Registration Form”, what is registered is “the
property situation of the invested enterprise when the contributor distributed capital into such enterprise”, the contributor being
stated as the Respondent, and the enterprise being stated as HK Co.  In other words, the registration shows the property rights of
the Respondent as contributor.  It is not inconsistent with the fact that under the Company Law, the Respondent is entitled to own
property rights.  Nor is it inconsistent with the argument that SASAC, acting on behalf of the CPG, is entitled to the equities ie
any return from the Shares, by way of dividends and any proceeds from the transfer of such Shares.  As Ms Cheng pointed out, the
registration of the Respondent’s interests in the Shares is to ensure that CPG obtains the return on its investment in the Respondent.
 The fact of registration of the Respondent’s property interests in the Shares does not by itself alter the nature of such property
in the Shares under the law.  92.  I find that the Respondent’s assertion of Crown immunity has not been validly made on behalf of the CPG.  In any event, I find
on the evidence that under PRC law, the Respondent is entitled to independent autonomy in its business operations, and it has not
been established that the Respondent is part of or controlled by the CPG to be entitled to Crown immunity against execution of its
assets. 93.  The Respondent’s assertion of Crown immunity is accordingly dismissed, and the charging order absolute against the Shares is granted.
 I make an order nisi that the Respondent is to pay to the Applicant and the SJ the costs of the application for the charging order,
including any costs order reserved in respect of such application.","andSECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

filed, the lawyers should have summarized the competing versions, if anything, to assist the court in deciding whether to summarily
dispose of the dispute or give directions, and to facilitate judgment writing. 100.  On preparation of hearing bundles, an index of documents that only stated the exhibit numbers without description of documents is
useless.  It does not facilitate the finding of exhibits or verification of facts. 101.  Bundles A to C should each start from page one.  Pagination like page 101-83, etc is clumsy.  Care must be taken to ensure that

acceptance of the sanctioned payment would not have prevented a trial of the counterclaim. Therefore, the indemnity costs entitled
should be confined to the costs of the action, but not the costs of the counterclaim. 4. Para 1 of the Defendant’s Summons filed on 14 April 2017 is not disputed.  I make an order in its terms.  As for para 2, I make
an order in terms subject to, firstly, limiting the indemnity costs to the action as aforesaid.  Secondly, the interest on the costs
should be limited to 4.5% p.a. on costs incurred from 16 May 2015 (see Golden Eagle International (Group) Ltd v GR Investment Holdings Ltd [2010] HKCFI 569; [2010] 3 HKLRD 273) until judgment and at judgment rate thereafter until payment. 5.

It can readily be seen that the factual matrix of Hayter is very different from the case before me. 51.  Secondly, the three defendants (B, H and R) in Hayter were jointly charged with murder, they had clearly embarked on a joint criminal enterprise.  The case against the three defendants before me is not one
of joint criminal enterprise. 52.  Should the prosecution wish to rely on the “building‑block” concept in the absence of any joint criminal enterprise, I will

This issue of conflict is indeed relied on as a major foundation for the removal application and may need to be dealt with when that
application is determined.  But the receivers had already in recent correspondence undertaken that they “will not cast any votes
within or on behalf of CSI which would lead to any dilution of CSI’s shareholding in CSCG”.  Further, as Mr Barlow SC pointed
out, while there had been proposals for the offer or placement of shares since the beginning of the receivership, none had been proposed
on the basis that no shareholders’ approval would be necessary.  He further submitted that if indeed a proposal is made to exercise
the general mandate, notice would have to be given to the receivers as members of the CSCG board and the receivers would be in a
position to ensure that the matter does go to the shareholders such as by convening an EGM to decide the matter and if necessary
to decide if any of the directors should be removed.  There is no dispute that the members in general meeting can revoke by ordinary
resolution any general mandate previously granted.  12. I am not prepared to proceed in this application, as I think the applicants implicitly invited me to, on the assumption that the

"HKSAR v. CHOW HEUNG WING,STEPHEN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 2217; HCCC 437/2015 (14 June 2017)","34.  The Specimen Directions referred to by the prosecution, while without any legal effect, are indeed very useful guidance for judges
in their preparation of the summing up.  The citation of cases such as Adomako thereinare for reference only.  As I have indicated earlier, I have no quarrel with, and indeed endorsed the application of, the
four elements enunciated in Adomako.  I only came to the view that the test for the last element is different in HK from that of UK as a result of the CFA in Sin Kam Wah overruling Chau Ming Cheong. 35.  For these reasons, I declined the invitation of the prosecution to depart from my earlier decision in Lai Shui Yin.  I ruled that in the present case, the test for the last element was the same as what I have ruled in Lai Shui Yin, ie the test for gross negligence was not only an objective reasonable man test, but the prosecution is required to prove that the
defendant’s subjective state of mind was culpable, that the defendant was subjectively aware of the obvious and serious risk of
death to the deceased. 36.  I will add here that the test should be the same for anyone facing a charge of GNM.  It makes no difference that the GNM in this

 The key distinction is said to be between cases where there is an immediate loss of value of some asset or interest in an asset
as a result of the acceptance of the contingent liability and cases in which the claimant has merely become subject to a contingency
which may or may not lead to loss in the future: see Jackson & Powell, Professional Liability, 8th ed, §5-045.  But it is not an issue that requires resolution at this hearing.  26.  In my view, the plaintiff has not met the threshold test.  Accordingly, as the court’s discretion has not been engaged, it is
not necessary to consider whether and how that discretion is to be exercised. 27.  The plaintiff’s appeal is dismissed and service of the writ is set aside.

respondent was informed of the SESC Announcement a day before it was made that involved a breach of secrecy by the Japanese regulators
which the respondent failed to prevent.  There is no evidence that the respondent was informed that the Japanese regulators would
be divulging any confidential information in breach of their secrecy obligation.  The issue as to whether the Japanese regulators
have divulged confidential information in breach of their secrecy obligation, would nevertheless come under consideration in relation
to the ground of review concerning the obligation and alleged breach of secrecy. The proposed amendment is not justified and refused. 17.  In light of the foregoing,

reasons for decision should serve as a reminder to all litigants and practitioners that courts take a dim view of late applications
to move milestone dates. In the post-CJR culture, parties and their lawyers should be frank and upfront on any matter that may potentially affect milestone events so
that the court seized of the matter can evaluate the situation and decide how best to balance the parties’ interests as well the
deployment of court’s resources. The prism is triangular, and it is not for a party to dictate the outcome by withholding information.
In future, litigants should not expect the courts to smile with like kindness as in the present case, and they may have to suffer
the consequences of their own tactical manoeuvres. In a slightly different context (but also in the exercise of the court’s broad
discretion on case management, Ng J (as approved by the Court of Appeal) in In the matter of James Henry Ting made clear unsatisfactory and tactical delay is a material factor that may sway the exercise of discretion against the applicant. 90.  On 16 June 2017, Ps’ solicitors wrote to the court to request inter alia for (a) the trial to be re-fixed in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (b) extension of time to submit Ps’
statement of costs. It was said that if it is possible to re-fix the trial in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel,
then some costs thrown away may be saved. In my view, this proposal would not cause Ds any prejudice since (i) it would be Ps who
may suffer some delay if the re-fixed trial is to accommodate the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (ii) saving some costs thrown
away will only benefit Ds who are liable to pay such costs. It is also appropriate to extend time for Ps to lodge their statement
of costs since they cannot prepare their statement of costs until it is known whether Ps are able to retain their existing counsel
upon re-fixing the trial and thereby save some costs. 91.  In the circumstances, on 16 June 2017, I granted the following directions on paper as follows:",Date of Decision: 13 June 2017Date of Handing Down Reasons for Decision: 19 June 2017,"(Marlene Ng)

the facts of this case fell within consideration number (2.), and I decide to exercise my discretion to deprive the defendant as
to costs, the question then becomes how much.  25.  Mr Suen, first of all, asked me to deprive the defendant of 100 per cent of its costs.  At the hearing, he modified it to 50 per
cent.  In the exercise of my discretion, having taken into account the view formed by the court on the witnesses, the time taken
in court, and as to the overlap of certain witnesses’ testimony with other issues, I have decided to deprive the defendant of 25
per cent of its costs of the action, and therefore I order that the defendant is to have 75 per cent of its costs of the action,
and that includes the counterclaim, to be taxed if not agreed, and I give certificate for two counsel because I believe that this
is a case which justifies attendance of two counsel.  26.  In my judgment, this costs argument cannot be viewed in the same way as considering who is the successful party in an action, and
therefore it cannot be said that simply because the defendant managed to get a cheque from the plaintiff in terms of costs, it is
therefore the successful party.  The reality of the matter is that both parties have to come to court because they cannot agree on
the principle in relation to awarding costs, and therefore in the exercise of my discretion, I believe the fairest order to make
for the costs of today is no order as to costs.",Date of Hearing: 22 June 2017Date of Ruling on Costs: 22 June 2017,"(Paul Shieh SC)

CHAN SHEE KEE v. CHAN GARY KEE AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1123; HCMP 1181/2017 (23 June 2017),"17.  The plaintiff commenced the present action by way of an originating summons in the expedited form (Form 10), instead of the general
form (Form 8).  The plaintiff accepts that, under Order 7, rule 2(1) of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A, the expedited form should only be used if “authorized or required”, and the expedited form is neither authorized nor
required to be used for commencing the present action.  Accordingly, the plaintiff took out a summons dated 19 June 2017 seeking
to correct this irregularity.  In view of the conclusion that I have reached that the declaration sought should not be granted, plainly
the court should not grant any relief under the summons. 18.  The court has, for many years, been drawing practitioners’ attention to the fact the expedited form of the originating summons
should be used only where authorized or required, and that in many cases the expedited form has been wrongly used (see, for example,
the decision of Godfrey J (as he then was) in Hong Kong Ping Jeng Lau Co Ltd v The Incorporated Owners of United Centre, HCMP 2971 of 1989, given on 4 December 1989, and more recently the decision of DHCJ Paul Lam SC in International Automotive Components Group v Xuke Trading Limited, HCMP 564/2017, given on 19 April 2017).  Despite the court’s reminders, the same mistake has kept being repeated.  It must be
emphasised that rules of court are meant to be observed.  It should not be assumed that the court will readily overlook breaches
of the rule regarding the correct form of the originating summons to be used for commencing an action even if it can be said that
no prejudice is suffered by the opposite party as a result of the use of the incorrect form. This is because the use of the correct
form of the originating summons carries implications beyond the mere form of the document, including the timetable for the filing
of evidence and the fixing of the date of hearing of the originating summons. 19.  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s originating summons dated 22 May 2017 and summons dated 19 June 2017 are dismissed.
 The parties are agreed that there should be no order as to the costs of this action, and I so order.","Date of Decision: 23 June 2017(Anderson Chow)

to correct this irregularity.  In view of the conclusion that I have reached that the declaration sought should not be granted, plainly
the court should not grant any relief under the summons. 18.  The court has, for many years, been drawing practitioners’ attention to the fact the expedited form of the originating summons
should be used only where authorized or required, and that in many cases the expedited form has been wrongly used (see, for example,
the decision of Godfrey J (as he then was) in Hong Kong Ping Jeng Lau Co Ltd v The Incorporated Owners of United Centre, HCMP 2971 of 1989, given on 4 December 1989, and more recently the decision of DHCJ Paul Lam SC in International Automotive Components Group v Xuke Trading Limited, HCMP 564/2017, given on 19 April 2017).  Despite the court’s reminders, the same mistake has kept being repeated.  It must be
emphasised that rules of court are meant to be observed.  It should not be assumed that the court will readily overlook breaches
of the rule regarding the correct form of the originating summons to be used for commencing an action even if it can be said that
no prejudice is suffered by the opposite party as a result of the use of the incorrect form. This is because the use of the correct
form of the originating summons carries implications beyond the mere form of the document, including the timetable for the filing
of evidence and the fixing of the date of hearing of the originating summons. 19.  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s originating summons dated 22 May 2017 and summons dated 19 June 2017 are dismissed.
 The parties are agreed that there should be no order as to the costs of this action, and I so order.",Date of Hearing: 21 June 2017Date of Decision: 23 June 2017,"(Anderson Chow)

Having come to that view, all that is required is that each item of costs should be reasonably incurred. 17.  Adopting a broad-brush approach, and without embarking on a mini-taxation, I would summarily assess the plaintiffs’ solicitors
costs for the Taxation Appeal and the Stay Summons at HK$133,900 in total, to be shared equally between the 2 plaintiffs (ie HK$66,950
for each plaintiff).  In respect of HCA 167/2011, I would further allow the sum of HK$196,000 by way of counsel’s fee. 18.  Accordingly, I would vary the costs order nisi made on 17 January 2017 to the effect that: “The defendants do pay the plaintiffs’ costs of the Taxation Appeal and the Stay

WO CHUN WAH v. CHAU KWEI YIN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1131; HCPI 903/2014 (23 June 2017),"56.  To sum up, as the Plaintiff inflated his claim, and it was reasonable and necessary for the Board to participate in this action.
Its attitude in the proceedings was impartial, which is beyond reproach. The settlement agreement reached between the Board and the
Plaintiff and my assessments were mainly based on the authorities and arguments put forward by the Board. In my view, the Board only
played a filtering role, and its participation assisted the court in arriving at a correct assessment and also accorded with public
interest and justice. Having considered the circumstances of this action as a whole and balancing the Plaintiff’s interest with
public interest, I conclude that it is not proper to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. The Board performed its function
by screening out unreasonable claims; on the contrary, the Plaintiff seriously inflated his claim. In such circumstances, it is wholly
unreasonable to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. Therefore, I make no order as to costs, and each party shall bear
its own costs. 57.  In summary, I find that the Plaintiff was an employee of the 2nd Defendant and that the Plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result of the 2nd Defendant’s breach of duty of care. I find that the 2nd Defendant is liable to pay to the Plaintiff damages of $1,428,547 together with interest on the principal of $1,395,309 at the rate
of 2% per annum from 18 November 2014 to the date of this judgment, and interest on the principal of $33,238 at half of the judgment
rate from 1 June 2013 to the date of this judgment, and thereafter interest on the outstanding principal at judgment rate until payment. 58.  Turning to costs, I order that the 2nd Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs, such costs to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations, and that there be no order as to costs between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant.",Date of Judgment: 23 June 2017(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1131.html,"

The 1st Defendant has also issued contribution and indemnity notice against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.  The 1st Defendant asks for full indemnity of the Plaintiff’s claim on the ground that the accident was directly caused by the negligence
of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. 91.  I disagree that there should be full indemnity. Although the 2nd Defendant is liable for the accident for pressing the wrong button of which the 3rd Defendant is vicariously liable, the 1st Defendant remained the direct employer of the Plaintiff.  As the employer, it had a non-delegable duty to provide a safe system and
a safe place of work for the Plaintiff.  If the 1st Defendant had discharged such duty, the accident could have been avoided.  Judging the blameworthiness of the parties, the 1st Defendant on the one hand and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants on the other should bear equal responsibility for the accident.  I therefore hold that the 1st Defendant is entitled to claim 50% contribution from the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim. 92.  I make a costs order nisi that: (i) the Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of the action against the 1st Defendant and the costs of the assessment of damages proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants; (ii) the 1st Defendant is entitled to the costs of the contribution proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants; and (iii) the Plaintiff’s own costs to be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations.

PETER ANTHONY REID AND ANOTHER v. THE ENVIRONMENT BUREAU [2017] HKCFI 1145; HCAL 90/2016 (27 June 2017),"11.  As is well recognised, judicial review is the means by which the Court of First Instance exercises its general supervisory jurisdiction
over inferior courts, tribunals and other bodies performing public functions.  In general terms, the nature and scope of the judicial
review jurisdiction is largely defined by the relief that a court may grant.  The court on review is required to check the exercise
of the public function that either has no lawful basis or has a lawful basis but has been exercised unfairly or unreasonably.  It
will not review the merits of a decision or attempt itself to perform the task that has been entrusted to the public authority by
law.  12.  Whilst the judicial review jurisdiction is an important means by which the citizen can bring to bear judicial scrutiny over the
exercise of public functions or responsibilities, it is incumbent on an applicant to follow the requirements and procedures as laid
down in the legislative and administrative framework in seeking redress under this jurisdiction.  In the present case, the decisions
or actions sought to be challenged by the applicants were well outside the prescribed time period, and the applicants did not in
any satisfactory manner articulate the public law wrongs that were alleged to have been committed.  The content of the application
was general dissatisfaction with the implementation and development of government policy in relation to waste management which has
been the subject of investigations and reports from the Director of Audit and the Public Accounts Committee respectively.  This was
an inappropriate attempt to invoke the judicial review jurisdiction where little if any effort was made to address the legal requirements
and issues.  13.  Notwithstanding the subject matter of waste management is an important issue of policy, the present application failed to properly
address the relevant legal procedures and issues in order to invoke the judicial review jurisdiction.  The application is therefore

was poor and how the material was inferior.  As noted, the statement of the expert was admitted into evidence by having her statement
read out in open court and therefore was not the subject of cross-examination.  Whilst the expert could have explained in greater
detail the lack of quality of the handbag in arriving at her conclusion, it is the case that she is familiar with Chanel products
and its quality, and has identified by the poor workmanship and inferior material that it is not one of their products.  18.  I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before the Magistrate, including the admission the appellant made at the time of her
arrest that this was a “highly imitated” handbag, the nature and circumstances of the transaction, the price difference between
the genuine handbag and the handbag sold by the appellant, and the expert evidence that this was not a genuine Chanel handbag, that

CHEN HONGQING v. MI JINGTIAN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1148; HCMP 962/2017 (27 June 2017),"79.  As I have explained in the earlier part of this decision, CSI does not carry on any business, other than holding the Shares as an
investment.  The appointment of independent receivers, to exercise the voting and other rights of a shareholder in the interim of
the determination of the dispute between Chen and the Defendants in the Arbitration, is not draconian and in fact serves to preserve
the value of the Shares.  It should also conserve the subject matter of the Arbitration, assisting to ensure that the arbitral process
is not frustrated in its final stages, should Chen’s claims to the Shares succeed but the Shares have been transferred to and registered
in someone else’s name, and the voting rights lost. 80.  Having considered the entire circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the appointment of receivers to exercise the voting
and other rights in the Shares is an interim order that may be granted by the court in Hong Kong in relation to arbitral proceedings.
 Bearing in mind that the Shares are of a company in Hong Kong, the interim appointment of receivers of such Shares will facilitate
the process of the arbitral tribunal or the Mainland court that has primary jurisdiction over the Arbitration, and it is just for
the court to grant such an interim order to maintain and preserve the status quo. 81.  An order will be made in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 and 4 of the Re-amended Originating Summons issued on 22 May 2017.  An order

BANK OF CHINA (HONG KONG) LTD v. CERTAIN AIM LTD [2017] HKCFI 1150; HCMP 1272/2007 (27 June 2017),"86.  There is also the question of D’s delay in making the application by the summons which is a factor to be taken into account. 
Wong said unconvincingly in his 1st affirmation that he only became aware of the judgment in September 2008.  Yeung also said unconvincingly in her 1st affirmation that she did not know of the judgment until shortly before the summons was issued.  Although there are disputed facts
as to when D became aware of the OS and the judgment, it is unlikely, in my view, that D only became aware of the judgment shortly
before the summons was issued.  There has obviously been delay in taking out the application.  Despite this, I am of the view that
the discretion to set aside the judgment should be exercised in favour of D.  I have found that defences with a real prospect of
success have been shown and in my view, it would be unjust not to set aside the judgment which was obtained by default without a
determination of the merits. 87.  I am satisfied that the appeal should be allowed. I allow the appeal and set aside Master K Lo’s order dated 17 May 2010.  The

HKSAR v. WU CHUN KIT [2017] HKCFI 1151; HCCC 162/2017 (28 June 2017),"6.  I have had submitted to me two letters.  One from the defendant who has expressed his remorse for what he has done.  He also stated
that he has joined a Christian group whilst in custody and he is keen to rehabilitate himself and lead a law abiding life in the
future.  The second letter comes from a minister of the Christian group who confirms the defendant’s participation in the group
and commitment to change his ways and rehabilitate himself.  I have carefully considered the information and material submitted to
me which I accept and will be as leniently as I possibly can when passing sentence on the defendant. 7.  According to the sentencing guideline cases of AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125 and HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691, for trafficking in Ice, a starting point for a quantity of 32.7 g of Ice within the indicated tariff band is 8 years and 6 months’
imprisonment.  There is also an international element due to the fact that the defendant brought drugs into Hong Kong from mainland
China.  As provided by HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKC 197 and HKSAR v Chung Ping Kun, CACC 85/2014, 2 July 2014, this warrants an enhancement on the defendant’s sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment.  This brings
the starting point to 8 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  As I have indicated, I will take into account the fact that the defendant

HKSAR v. LIU YEE LUN [2017] HKCFI 1152; HCCC 163/2017 (28 June 2017),"8.  On the individual approach, the following calculation can be made.  The quantity of ketamine involved is 57.4 g and according to
the guidelines laid down in S for J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1, a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of cocaine involved is 5.42 g and according to the guidelines
laid down in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370, a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of Ice involved is 6.21 g and according to the guidelines laid
down in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125, a sentence of 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  This would make a total sentence of 13 years and 6 months’ imprisonment
and obviously taking into account the totality principle, an adjustment downwards would need to be made. 9.  On the combined approach, most of the drugs were ketamine, and applying the sentencing guidelines for ketamine to the total quantity
of narcotic involved, which would be about 70 g, a sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  The difficulty
I have with the combined approach is that for small quantities of cocaine and Ice, the sentencing tariff is higher than that for
ketamine.  There needs to be an adjustment.  The conversion is one way of doing it and I will be guided by it, but as indicated there
is a difference in the final sentence depending on which drug the total narcotic has been converted to which is then applied to its
sentencing tariff.  10.  I will impose a starting point, applying the conversion submitted by the prosecution, of 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment which
I will reduce by one third for the defendant’s early guilty plea to 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. ",Date of Hearing: 28 June 2017Date of Sentence: 28 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

WEI XING v. WILLWIN DEVELOPMENT (ASIA) CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 1157; HCMP 1922/2016 (28 June 2017),"5.  As the second basis for seeking a variation, Mr Leung submits on behalf of Wen that there was no justification for making Wen a
party or for ordering costs against him.  I agree with Mr Ho that this argument is no longer open to Wen.  The issue was debated
at the substantive hearing on 1 March 2017 (and in the skeleton arguments for that hearing).  In my judgment I gave reasons at §27
dealing with those arguments and disposing of the issue.  In §28, I actually concluded there was basis for ordering Wen to pay costs.
It was on the quantum of costs awarded that I expressed my view on a provisional basis.  Even if I am technically not functus officio in relation to the question, I see no special reason why it should be re‑opened. 6.  Accordingly Wen’s application must be dismissed, with costs to Xing on a nisi basis (with a certificate for counsel insofar as necessary). 7.  I also direct that the sum of $350,000 previously paid by Xing into court as security for Wen’s and the Company’s costs be released
and paid out to Xing.  Although he was ordered to pay the costs of the application for security, the costs order in his favour in
the originating summons is likely to be sufficient to meet them.  Any other debts that may exist are not a ground for withholding
the sum from Xing which was paid into court only as security for the costs of these proceedings.","Date of Written Submissions: 6, 14 & 21 June 2017Date of Decision on Costs: 28 June 2017","(Godfrey Lam)

HKSAR v. ZAMAN MUNIR UZ [2017] HKCFI 1158; HCMA 113/2017 (28 June 2017),"20.  The appellant submitted that the sentence of 22 months and 2 weeks was too long.  He asked for leniency so that he can be released
as soon as possible so that he could return to look after his father and children in Pakistan.  21.  In sentencing the appellant the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452.  The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline sentence of 15 months imprisonment upon a plea of guilty in relation to section 38AA offences.  The appellant was convicted after trial and as such the correct starting point to be adopted is one of 22 months and 2
weeks imprisonment.  The appellant did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the starting point.  22.  Although the magistrate considered enhancing the sentence he decided not to do so, it could be said that the magistrate was generous
to the appellant in not enhancing the starting point as the appellant had a previous similar offence.  In the circumstances, the
sentence is neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.  Accordingly the appeal against sentence is dismissed. ",(S. D’ Almada Remedios)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1158.html,"

further submission.  There were also costs for attending the hearing twice.  43.  All that the DOJ had done in this case was consistent with a neutral but helpful attitude towards the court.  It was not an attempt

HKSAR v. TAM TAK CHEUNG [2017] HKCFI 1163; HCCC 138/2016 (29 June 2017),"18.  The indecent assault was particularly shocking and grievous.  In all likelihood it would have escalated into further serious sexual
violence on the victim if not for the fortuitous intervention of the stranger.  The defendant had kissed and fondled the victim and
inserted his fingers into her vagina, and he was clearly contemplating having sexual intercourse with her, when he pushed her onto
the ground and unzipped his pants.  19.  It is the duty of the courts to ensure that violation of a person’s modesty and dignity in cases of indecent assault is soundly
deprecated.  This was a serious case of indecent assault which warrants severe punishment.  I note that the maximum penalty for indecent
assault is 10 years’ imprisonment.  Mr Boyton submitted the case of HKSAR v Keita Ali,CACC 419/2015, 21 March 2017, unreported, by means of comparison where the appellant indecently assaulted an elderly woman and was
sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment.  Comparing indecent assault cases is of limited utility because no two cases are exactly alike,
and the sentence to be passed will in any event necessarily involve applying the relevant sentencing principles to the particular
circumstances of the case.  What makes this a serious case of indecent assault was the sexual molestation perpetrated by the defendant
on the victim by kissing and fondling her and inserting his fingers in her vagina.  In light of the circumstances of the present
indecent assault, I would adopt a starting point of 5 years’ imprisonment.  20.  As a result of the defendant having pleaded guilty, he is entitled to a one third discount, and accordingly the sentence on Count
1 is reduced from 6 years and 6 months to 4 years and 4 months’ imprisonment, and on Count 3 is reduced from 5 years to 3 years
and 4 months’ imprisonment.  Taking into account the totality principle, and in order to arrive at a sentence that reflects the
overall criminality and to avoid any overlap between the offences, I order that 20 months of the sentence on Count 3 run consecutively
to the sentence on Count 1, thus resulting in a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment.","Date of Sentence: 29 June 2017(Kevin Zervos)

conclusion either way on whether the plans should be disapproved under s 16(1)(j).  It follows that Ground 1 is not made out and that this court should not direct the Tribunal to dismiss the appeal. 43.  For the above reasons, the application for judicial review succeeds on Ground 2, but Ground 1 fails.

light of this judgment. 44.  While the BA’s application is granted, I have rejected Ground 1 and the associated contention that the Tribunal should be directed

CHAN KAM NUN v. THE IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT [2017] HKCFI 1199; HCA 214/2016 (4 July 2017),"27.  In view of the above, the plaintiff’s action is already time-barred.  His statement of claim should be struck out and his action
dismissed.  Therefore, I uphold the Master’s decision and dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal. 28.  As I am upholding the Master’s decision allowing D’s striking-out application and dismissing the plaintiff’s action, it necessarily
follows that the Master’s order dismissing the plaintiff’s summons for striking out must stand.  In para 22 of his judgment,
the Master briefly stated the plaintiff’s grounds of application and the reasons for dismissing his striking-out summons.  The
Master said: 29.  For the above reasons, I dismiss all of the plaintiff’s appeals, uphold the Master’s decisions striking out the plaintiff’s
statement of claim, dismissing his action and dismissing the plaintiff’s summons for striking out, and uphold the Master’s decision
on costs.  I also order the plaintiff to pay the defendant costs of this appeal, assessed summarily at $10,000.",(Anthony To)Deputy High Court Judge,"The Plaintiff in person, present.",/2017/1199.html,"

to the appellant.  40.  The humanitarian grounds advanced by the appellant on this appeal are not factors which warrant a reduction of his sentence.  The

into account irrelevant matters, and failed to take into account relevant matters.  53.  The appeal will accordingly be allowed.  The claim in the bill for two solicitors on each of the 64 items under objection is rejected.

SKYRUN LIGHT INDUSTRY (HONG KONG) CO LTD AND ANOTHER v. SWIFT RESOURCES LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1196; HCA 1278/2014 (6 July 2017),"20.  Ninthly, in respect of Item D3, Ps claimed 5 hours for preparation for the Hearing and 2nd PTR at $22,500. Ds claimed this was excessive and a legal clerk or paralegal spending 0.5 hour at $1,000/hour would suffice. I do
not understand the nature of such objection. Since Ds had no objection to Item D4 (ie attendance at the Hearing and 2nd PTR by Ps’ solicitor fee-earner), such solicitor fee-earner rather than any legal clerk or paralegal should be the one who had
to prepare for such hearings. That said, given the allowances above for attendance on counsel (including conference with counsel)
and perusal of documents, and further given the involvement of counsel for the Hearing and 2nd PTR, even on a generous indemnity basis, I am unconvinced the solicitor fee-earner would have to spend much time for preparation
for the hearings. I allow 1.5 hours at $6,750 for Item D3. 21.  Tenthly, in respect of Item E2, Ps claimed counsel’s fees for conference for 1.5 hours in the sum of $6,750, which translated
to an hourly rate of $4,500. I find such rate reasonable for counsel of 20 years’ experience. As explained in paragraph 16 above,
there was no duplicate between this item and Item C3. For the reasons explained in paragraphs 16-17 above, I allow counsel’s fees
at $6,750 for Item E2. 22.  Taking into account all of the above matters, having considered the nature and scope of the present action and the Summons, the
affirmations filed in support of such summons, the skeleton submissions and list of authorities, what transpired at the Hearing and
2nd PTR, the involvement of counsel, and considering all circumstances, I am satisfied the claim for costs in Ps’ Statement of Costs
(save for the items I have adjusted down) was not unreasonable or disproportionate. Ps’ total costs on their Statement of Costs
are assessed at $287,325 (being $600 (B1) + $600 (B2) + $22,500 (C1) + $9,000 (C2) + $11,250 (C3) + $4,500 (D1) + $22,500 (D2) +

Turning to LRMJ–29 and 37, they are both documents bearing the 2nd defendant’s signature.  For LRMJ–29, the 2nd plaintiff says that the 1st defendant had told her it was not signed by the 2nd defendant, but by the girlfriend of Kong Pok‑man, and the signature is different from all the other known signatures of the 2nd defendant; see her 1st affirmation, paragraphs 87 to 89.  For LRMJ–37, the 2nd plaintiff says the 1st defendant forged it in her presence; see her 1st affirmation, paragraph 64.  The 1st defendant denies this; see her 1st affirmation paragraph 52.  It seems to me that if the signatures do indeed look very different, then perhaps an expert cannot add
very much. 10.  In any event, these documents are not in the summons, but only mentioned in the proposed directions of the plaintiffs lodged on
3 July 2017, so that, I think, to be fair, the 1st and 4th defendants should be given time to consider and respond to the application to adduce expert evidence on handwriting in relation to

now become enforceable as a judgment of this court.  The Company does not suggest that it cannot pay the Award.  It simply refuses
to do so and takes the position that there is nothing the Defendant can do about it in Hong Kong. This seems to me to be unacceptable.
 The Company wishes to take advantage of Hong Kong’s financial system and the legal system that underpins it.  Hong Kong’s legal
system and courts provides investors both domestically and internationally with confidence in the reliability and integrity of the
financial system.  The Company’s refusal to honour the Award shows disregard for the integrity of our legal system and, in a non-technical
sense at least, contempt for the High Court of Hong Kong.  If the Company wishes to be listed in Hong Kong it should honour the Award
and respect the decision of Mimmie Chan J.  There is a public interest in steps being taken to remedy this conduct and to disabuse
other Mainland companies of the idea that they can take the benefit of access to Hong Kong’s financial system without the burden
of complying with our laws.  In the circumstances of this case the obvious and appropriate step is the winding up of the Company
in Hong Kong and the delisting of its H shares. 32.  Before ending this judgment, I should deal with a preliminary point taken by Mr Coleman.  The originating summons originally sought
only a permanent injunction enjoining the Defendant from presenting a petition.  It was subsequently amended to replace the injunction
with the declaration.  Mr Coleman argued that the question of whether or not the second core requirement was satisfied was not one
that justified enjoining the presentation of a petition.  It could not sensibly be suggested that the answer to the question was
clear and that it would be an abuse to present a petition.  The Company was simply trying to avoid the difficulties caused by presentation;
difficulties that would be the result of its own intransigence rather than abusive conduct by the Defendant.  I was referred to Re Sinom (Hong Kong) Limited [12] in which it was held by Kwan J that a creditor should not be prevented from issuing a petition unless the petition was bound to fail.
 I agree that this is normally the correct approach.  In the present case I have deviated from it because it has seemed to me given
the extensive argument I have heard that the most practical course is to determine the issue immediately on the originating summons
rather than delay it to the hearing of a petition. 33.  I will dismiss the originating summons.  I will make a costs order nisi that the Company pays the Defendant’s costs.  Given the views that I have expressed in [31] I consider it appropriate that the
costs be assessed on an indemnity basis to reflect what in my view is the unethical conduct of the Company.","andARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LIMITED

to uphold the DPO Order and DPO Review Order on arguments that did not find favour with this court. In the circumstances, he must
be taken to have been aware of the usual consequences of litigation and could not have expected “low-costs adjudication”. Having
considered all the circumstances, I grant a costs order nisi that C shall pay D2 costs of and occasioned by the Appeal to be taxed if not agreed.","(D)有薪假期

HKSAR v. WONG YI CHING [2017] HKCFI 1219; HCCC 112/2017 (11 July 2017),"7.  The video recorded interview, VDP14, was also wholly exculpatory but the defence wish it to be rendered inadmissible nevertheless.
 The prosecution wishes to rely upon it to prove presence and supply and from that will ask the jury to infer knowledge.  They say
it is admissible even although it is prima facie exculpatory.  The basis of the defendant’s complaint is that she was induced by PW1 not to volunteer information as to her ability
to contact a person she called “Ah Po” and that, as a result of that inducement, she altered answers to other questions to fall
in line with her failure to disclose Ah Po’s contact details.  She also altered her answers to take into account PW1’s suggestion
that she had met Ah Po that morning. 8.  I do not understand why the defendant would wish to exclude wholly exculpatory admissions made either at the scene of arrest or
in interview but that is a matter for her.  I can find no logic in the complaint made by the defendant in respect to her answers
in interview.  I cannot see why the police would not want the contact details of Ah Po if there was an Ah Po who had been the person
who provided the defendant with the drugs.  I cannot see why the officer would even know about the existence of Ah Po at this stage
of the investigation prior to any interview or why it would be important to the police to have the defendant meeting with Ah Po that
same morning.  In cases of trafficking, defendants are hardly ever given bail and I do not believe that PW1 would have suggested
it.  Indeed, it does not appear that the defendant complains that he did so explicitly.  The defendant herself accepted that she
knew she was going to be prosecuted but maintained that she thought she would get bail as a result of what he said i.e. it wouldn’t necessarily be the case that she wouldn’t be able to leave, if she refrained from giving information which would clearly be of assistance to both her and the police. 9.  I considered the video recorded interview carefully as the defendant also complained that she was kicked by PW1 at one point because
it appeared she was going to provide information she had been asked to withhold.  Throughout the interview the defendant sat upright
with arms crossed and legs crossed.  She looked defensive and she spoke clearly, confidently and quickly without any real hesitation
despite the transcript reading as if she was hesitant.  The officer did not move at the point the defendant referred to as the kick
whilst I considered that she had simply adjusted her position in the chair very slightly.  I do not accept that she was kicked at
that point.  I do not accept that she changed her story at that point because of a kick.  There were two officers in the room and
two officers who escorted her to the room.  I do not accept that she was momentarily left with only PW1 such that he could remind
her not to mention her ability to contact Ah Po or, out of the blue, to suggest that she had bumped into Ah Po that morning.  Accordingly,
I do not find that any part of the VRI was entered into involuntarily and, if admissible on other grounds, it may be adduced.","andWONG Yi-ching (female) (王怡靜)

particularly when he is now married and has a family to support.  Coupled with the remorsefulness of the appellant and the support
of his sister and father as set out in his grounds of appeal the appellant should stand a good chance of rehabilitation after drug
addiction treatment.  The court should not lightly give up helping him in this regard. 12.  The magistrate correctly considered the issue of proportionality between the offence and sentence before making the detention order.
 Taking into account the criminal record of the appellant, the nature and value of property involved in the offence and the whole
circumstances of the case an immediate custodial sentence is inevitable.  An order of detention in the DATC is a much better option
than imprisonment and is not out of proportion with the criminality of the appellant in the present case.  The court is of the view
that the sentence is neither excessive nor wrong in principle. 13.  Appeal against sentence is dismissed.",(Joseph Yau)Judge of the Court of First Instance,of the High Court,/2017/1232.html,"

CLEVER OCEAN GROUP LTD v. AMYLINEAR INTERNATIONAL LTD [2017] HKCFI 1583; HCMP 3596/2016 (12 July 2017),"14.  It seems to me clear from Mr Miller’s report, read in its totality and in particular para 8(m)(n) and para 9(m)(n), that Ms Liu
was validly appointed as administrator of her late husband’s estate and was entitled to direct that she be appointed the applicant’s
sole director and that the share in the company be transferred into her name.  I can see no reason on the face of the report to doubt
this conclusion and that at present Ms Liu is authorised to commence the present application.  15.  The only issue is whether the Companies have demonstrated any credible reason to think that a co-administrator will be appointed
by the BVI court and that if it does this might lead to Ms Liu’s authority being interfered with.  I think not.  First, it seems
to me that given Mr Lin’s limited BVI assets and Ms Liu and her sons’ right to the estate of her late husband, there is no reason
to think that the BVI court’s initial willingness to appoint one administrator would be changed.  Secondly, it seems to me highly
doubtful that if the BVI court did appoint a co-administrator it would be either Ms Liu’s father-in-law or her brother-in-law (the
other director of the Companies).  The evidence before me clearly demonstrates that trust between Ms Liu and her father‑in-law
and brother-in-law has broken down, and I would expect somebody independent to be appointed if a co-administrator is to be appointed
at all.  I can see no sensible reason for thinking that they would think it desirable or prudent to take a different approach to
the present matter to Ms Liu.     16.  I will therefore make orders for the convening of EGMs of the respondent companies.  I will hear counsel on the form of the orders

The test for granting leave to appeal in this type of situation was set out by the Chief Judge in 厦門新景地集團有限公司 v Eton Properties HCMP 13 of 2012, 14 Feb 2012, para 9, 3.  Since the CJR, the courts have endeavoured to make it clear that parties are expected to carefully and thoroughly consider from
an early stage all steps leading up to trial, and not to wait until the eve of trial before making last minute interlocutory applications.
 I have in my Decision of 30 June 2017 referred to all the matters which I have taken into consideration in balancing the value of
the Isherwood statement sought to be produced, the potential prejudice to the Plaintiffs and the Defendant, the explanation offered
by the Plaintiffs for the late application, the disruptive effect on the trial and the preparations for trial, and the overall fairness
and justice of the case. 4.  Having considered the draft Grounds of Appeal, I am not persuaded that the Plaintiffs’ appeal against my exercise of discretion
have reasonable prospects of success, in that it can be shown that I had exercised my discretion under wrong principles of law, or
that I had failed to take into consideration relevant factors, or had taken into consideration irrelevant factors.  It is trite that
an appellate court cannot interfere simply because its members consider that they would, if they themselves had sat at first instance,
have reached a different conclusion.  The application for leave to appeal is accordingly dismissed, with costs and certificate for

ELITE DRAGON LTD v. BEL GLOBAL RESOURCES HOLDINGS LTD [2017] HKCFI 1247; HCCL 8/2014 (14 July 2017),"9.  Should I be wrong, and the Court does have jurisdiction to consider an application made after the period of 14 days specified in
r5B(6) to vary the Order Nisi, I decline to vary the Order Nisi to provide for costs to be paid on an indemnity basis.  The summons
to vary the Order Nisi only seeks variation of the costs to be paid by Elite. 10.  Costs are in the discretion of the Court.  Despite the findings made in the Judgment, as to the liability of Elite and Sunny for
damages and to account for profits, Elite’s liability is essentially on the basis of Stephen Sy (“Stephen”)’s knowledge being imputed to his company, Elite (para 141 of the Judgment).  An order for costs to be paid by Stephen on an
indemnity basis would have been appropriate in this case, but the action has been discontinued against Stephen.  Having considered
the role of Elite in the case, I decline to order costs to be paid by Elite on the indemnity basis sought. 11.

"HKSAR v. LOPEZ GARCIA, MANUEL ORLANDO [2017] HKCFI 1249; HCCC 140/2016 (14 July 2017)","42.  As I have explained, the narcotic content of the drugs involved warrant a starting point of 22 years’ imprisonment which is to
be enhanced by a further 2 years for an international element to 24 years’ imprisonment.  The defendant is entitled to a one third
discount for his guilty plea which will be increased by 4 percent for the assistance that he rendered to the authorities in participating
in the controlled delivery operation. Accordingly, his sentence will be reduced by 37.3 percent which will result in a sentence of
15 years’ imprisonment.  43.  I will further discount the sentence by 6 months because of the defendant’s personal circumstances and involvement in this case.
The defendant’s personal circumstances and character, to a large extent are reflected by the testimonials on his behalf that I
have accepted, the positive contribution that he has made to dissuade others in participating in the drug trade, and the details
that he has supplied to the Mexican authorities concerning this case.  I have also borne in mind the matters advanced in mitigation
that warrant the discount that I will give. 44.  The defendant is therefore sentenced to a term of 14 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 14 July 2017Date of Sentence: 14 July 2017,(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/1249.html,"

LAM KIN CHUNG v. SOKA GAKKAI INTERNATIONAL OF HONG KONG LTD [2017] HKCFI 1250; [2017] 4 HKLRD 192; HCMP 2685/2016 (14 July 2017),"38. The Applicant has shown a strong prima facie case of malpractice in the election and nomination of members to be appointed to the management committee.  As a result of this malpractice,
it is likely that Soka is being hijacked by “SGI headquarters”.  The Applicant is intending to secure support from the other
members to convene an extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of challenging such malpractice.  The present committee members
who have control over the management and operation of Soka have a personal interested in what the Applicant is seeking to do and
in the outcome of the extraordinary general meeting, if held.  In the light of Soka’s pre-litigation conduct, the Applicant’s
concern about the committee’s good faith in honouring its undertaking not to perform any screening is well justified.  Screening
is difficult to detect and prove and is costly to rectify.   39. The Applicant has shown he has a proper purpose to access the register and to be provided a copy.  As a general rule, the court will
make a mandatory order to give effect to a legal right and the burden is on the company seeking to resist the making of the order
to persuade the court to exercise its discretion not to make such order.  Having regard to the circumstances above, I consider that
the preferred course is to bend in favour of ordering inspection of the register and provision of a copy on terms rather than refusing
to make the order by relying on Soka’s undertaking to act as a post box for facilitating communication between the Applicant and
the other members.  I therefore allow the application and order inspection of the register and provision of a copy on payment of
the prescribed fee and on the Applicant’s undertaking to use the information contained therein solely for the purpose of communicating
with the other members in relation to the two purposes set out in paragraph 4; not to use the said information after the forthcoming
annual general meeting; and to destroy the copy or any copies made therefrom, whether in the form of hard copies or soft copies or
in whatever form, within one month after the said meeting.  I also make a costs order nisi that the Applicant shall have costs of the application. 40.

RE DAYS INTERNATIONAL LTD [2017] HKCFI 1323; HCCW 299/2011 (14 July 2017),"2.  To cut a relatively complex story short, Global Empire’s claim relates to an alleged assignment of debt to it by the Dayarams
in connection with a company called Days International Limited.  The Dayarams were charged and convicted of fraud in relation to
the affairs of the company and in particular the circumstances in which the alleged debt was created.  3.  As my earlier decision explains, the circumstances in which it is suggested that Global Empire came to acquire the debt and indeed
the genuineness of the debt itself are, to put it at its lowest, highly questionable and given the conviction of the Dayarams and
the failure of their subsequent appeal, it is quite clear that the suggestion that Global Empire is owed any money by the company
as a result of the assignment is bound to fail. 4.  As a consequence, Global Empire has agreed to withdraw its summons appealing the liquidators’ decision and pay the costs, the
only issue is whether or not the costs should be paid on an indemnity basis as the liquidators seek.  It seems to me to be quite
clear that Global Empire’s appeal of the liquidators’ decision was pure chutzpah and it had no realistic prospect of success
and should never have been brought.  I will therefore order that the costs are assessed on an indemnity basis.",Date of Hearing: 14 July 2017Date of Decision: 14 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. SUN MIN [2017] HKCFI 1266; [2017] 4 HKLRD 211; HCMP 2236/2015 (17 July 2017),"17.  I had some concerns about whether or not an order that the Defendant pay to a counter party to a transaction who sold her shares
an amount assessed on the basis of the difference between the sale price and a valuation of the shares based on the price in the
market once the inside information became known to the market, was a windfall for the seller rather than restitutionary in nature
as section 213(2)(b) envisages. 18.  Mr Yu’s argument is that it is apparent from the inclusion of section 213(8), which allows damages to be claimed by the SFC on
behalf of a counter party to a transaction, that section 213(2)(b) is not concerned with compensating a counter party for any loss
caused to him or her.  Section 213(2)(b) requires the court to make the assumption that the counter party retained the shares and
ignore the sale.  On this assumption it is legitimate to calculate the amount to be paid by way of restitution by looking at what
the position of the counter party would have been if he or she had retained the shares and been in a position to sell them when the
share price rose. 19.  Whilst I understand the argument and accept that given the agreement of the parties the order sought in the present case is one
that can be made, and will accordingly make an order in the terms of the originating summons subject to certain minor changes in
the periods for payment, I must say that I harbour reservations about how section 213(2)(b) operates.  It does seem to me that section
213(2)(b) applied as explained by Mr Yu results in a defendant having to pay a sum that neither represents (a) disgorgement of profit
improperly made by the insider nor (b) restoration of loss suffered by another person trading in the shares as a consequence of the
insider’s conduct.  It seems to fall into a separate category, which I have difficulty in characterising.  As, however, the order
is agreed and I have not had the benefit of full argument before me I think it is best that I go no further.  It may be that this
is an issue, which will come back before the court at some time in the future in circumstances in which it can be more fully considered.",Date of Decision: 30 June 2017Date of Reasons for Decision: 17 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

to be imposed should be one which will help the appellant get rid of her drug addiction.  The magistrate rightly came to the conclusion
that the appellant should undergo a period of cure and rehabilitation in an addiction treatment centre. 15.  There are ample authorities, notably HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] HKCA 61; [2001] 1 HKC 261, saying that for the type of offence committed by the appellant, the starting point is in the range of 12 to 18 months imprisonment.

 The Plaintiff, under the “arrangement” with the Dings, retained absolute and full control of the Lands according to the various
documents that had been executed by the latter (see: para 155 of the CA Judgment).  Hence, the Dings cannot be “the former owners”

meaning of the LRO.  I accept that the Plaintiff is the only party who is entitled to claim the Compensation. 37.  For the above reasons, I allowed the Plaintiff’s application and granted the relief as sought by it.",(David Lok)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1272.html,"

it notified Mr Lau, advising him of the nature and likely consequences of the proceedings, informing him of his rights, and giving
him the opportunity to be heard on the matter, even the opportunity to elect an oral hearing if he wished to have one.  Similarly,
the Appeals Tribunal should have addressed the issue of “previous practice” as well as considering the factual dispute that had
been raised by the applicant in relation to the complainants’ dealings with the insurance agent.  These are matters that most likely
would have warranted an oral hearing.  128.  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that a number of procedural irregularities took place before the IARB and the Appeals
Tribunal that violated fundamental principles of natural justice, as well as the requirements of Clause 39, and that the Appeals
Tribunal left unresolved various critical issues raised by the applicant.  In line with my judgment, I therefore make an order certiorari
quashing the decision of the 2nd respondent, including the payment order.  I remit the matter back to the Appeals Tribunal for rehearing and reach a decision according
to law and to any relevant comment in this judgment.  129.  It seems to me that on the question of costs the applicant should receive its costs, but I will require argument on the issue in
light of the Court of Appeal decision in Orrico Philippe v Municipal Services Appeals Board [2015] HKCA 332; [2015] 4 HKLRD 111, if applicable.

have to be examined.  I accept the submission that the appeal will be rendered nugatory without a stay because, without the stay,
the PLs would have to expend enormous manpower and other resources to comply with the Order. Further, no prejudice arising from the
interim stay has been suggested by either Mr Lee or Mr Shum.  18.  In the premises, I make an order in terms of paras 1 and 2 of the PLs’ Summons filed on 14 July 2017. 19.  In respect of costs, I order that the costs of this application be in the cause of the Stay Application.  However, there are 2 sets
of reserved costs incurred for the hearings before Master Au-Yeung and Master Hui on respectively 5 and 14 July 2017.  I am satisfied

more prejudicial than probative.  However, he acknowledged in oral submissions that the identification evidence of the two police
officers was not of poor quality.  In any event, he lists a number of matters that he submits rendered the identification parade
evidence unreliable.  First, he argues that the identifications were made of a stranger.  That may be so, but both police officers
were greeted by Ah Moon and spent a considerable period of time with him in the lounge.  He chatted with them and entertained them
while they were there.  This was not a fleeting encounter.  Secondly, he complains that the two police officers were extremely precise
in their height estimates of the appellant.  One officer said he was 175-176 cm tall.  The other officer said he was 1.73 metres
tall.  He argues that appellant was the tallest, by about half a head, of the eight people used in the identification parade and
so therefore he stood out.  The participants in the identification parade were of varying heights, and whilst the appellant was the
tallest, the range of heights were not of a nature or degree that would render the identification parade unfair. Thirdly, he complains
that two of the actors were Filipinos and not Thai nationals like the appellant.  Whilst it is true that two of the actors were Filipinos,
their general appearance and characteristics was similar to the other participants in the identification parade.  It should be noted
that the other participants were Thai nationals.  But in any event what was important, as correctly noted by the magistrate, was
whether the actors reasonably resembled the appellant.  He was satisfied that the identification parade was fairly conducted and
I agree.  There is no substance to this ground of appeal. 16.  I have considered the evidence presented at trial and the issues before the magistrate, and I find no basis to interfere with the
magistrate’s verdict.  As this is a rehearing on the papers, I am satisfied to the requisite burden and standard of proof that
the appellant is guilty of the offences as charged.  17.  The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed. ",Date of Hearing: 21 July 2017Date of Judgment: 21 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

I note that the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence of using a copy of a false instrument, contrary to section 74 of the Crimes Ordinance.  The head sentence for such an offence is imprisonment for 14 years.  The magistrate applied the sentencing guidelines for an offence
contrary to section 7A of the Registration of Persons Ordinance which in the circumstances of the case was appropriate.  He noted that a proper sentence in such circumstances is one of 15 months’
imprisonment on a plea of guilty.  He correctly took the view that there was no difference in terms of culpability where a photocopy
of a forged identity card is used.  He accordingly imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment on the appellant for this offence.
 8.  The magistrate ordered that the terms of imprisonment on each offence run concurrently.  9.  I have considered the sentences imposed by the magistrate and his reasons for doing so and there is no basis for this Court to interfere
with the decision of the magistrate.  The appeal against sentence is dismissed.",Date of Hearing: 21 July 2017Date of Judgment: 21 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

in opposition even in the absence of any supporting evidence filed by the relevant defendants. I have perused the affidavit not without
reluctance. With respect, it is of no assistance and it merely shows poor judgment on the part of the plaintiff’s legal advisors. 26.  The counsel brief is really modest. It was at the outset agreed that there should be paper disposal of the Variation Summons. Mr
Ng’s written submissions are capable of dealing with all the arguments advanced on behalf of the relevant defendants. The supporting
work to be undertaken by the plaintiff’s solicitors should be minimal. I believe 1.5 professional hours of the handling solicitor

and together with his immaturity of youth, has committed this crime.  I am of the view that in the special circumstances of his case,
rehabilitation of him is a matter of importance which warrants greater emphasis when passing sentence.  In light of the seriousness
of the offence and the sentencing guideline cases, a term of imprisonment is warranted.   10.  Cocaine and heroin are equated for sentencing purposes and the tariffs as fixed for heroin in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370 apply to cocaine.  This was confirmed in AG v Pedro Nel Rojas [1994] HKCA 54; [1994] 1 HKC 342.  According to the sentencing guidelines for the quantity of narcotic content involved of 69.65g of cocaine, the defendant is in the
band of 50 to 200 g, where the guideline starting point for traffickers after trial, subject to any enhancement, is 8 to 12 years’
imprisonment.  I will therefore adopt a starting point of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment which I will reduce by one third for
the defendant’s guilty plea to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  As I have mentioned, I am of the view that there are special
circumstances in the defendant’s case, as highlighted by his background and youth, that warrant a further reduction in sentence
in order to serve the desirability of rehabilitation.  I will reduce his sentence to 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  11.  I note that the defendant is currently serving a detention centre order.  In accordance with section 7 of the Detention Centres Ordinance, Cap 239, such an order will lapse if the person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is not suspended.

that the defendant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months.  This order is somewhat
meaningless in light of the substantial term of imprisonment that has been passed in relation to the drug trafficking offence. 11.  Ms Pauline Leung, on behalf of the defendant, has very helpfully taken me to the photographs of the scene where the defendant was
arrested which depicts the position and damage of the vehicles.  Whilst it would appear that it was not a significant collision between
the vehicles, it nevertheless was an attempt by the defendant to avoid apprehension which put the safety of the police officers at
risk.  As an aggravating factor to the circumstances of the drug trafficking offence, I would have enhanced the sentence by 2 months’
imprisonment.  However, as the defendant has been sentenced in relation to the two separate offences of dangerous driving and drug
trafficking, and taking into account the totality principle, I order that 2 months of the sentence on the dangerous driving offence
run consecutively to the sentence on the drug trafficking offence.  12.  The defendant is therefore sentenced to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 24 July 2017Date of Sentence: 24 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

HKSAR v. LAM HING CHIT [2017] HKCFI 2436; HCCC 75/2017 (24 July 2017),"25.  Does the fact that the conduct undertaken by the Accused which he admits render the admission by him in the first letter inadmissible
upon the basis that the prejudicial impact of this conduct is such as to render his trial unfair?  This is upon the basis that it
reveals criminal conduct of the nature of an attempt to pervert the course of public justice.  Many acts by an accused person following
a crime may be criminal (for example, destruction or concealment of evidence and interference with witnesses) and some may not (for
example, flight).  Sometimes if the conduct of an accused person after the crime is of great significance a charge of attempting
to pervert the course of public justice might be justifiable.  There would be, however, many, many cases where to add such an additional
charge would obscure the main issue.  Drafting indictments requires an acute appreciation of the relationship between the forest
and the trees.  However, it seems to me that such prejudice is something which can be cured by direction.  In any event, I do not
regard the prejudice as so great as to prevent the fair trial of the indictment as laid. 26.  In the result, in my judgment the first letter should be admitted into evidence subject to appropriate arrangements being made for
redaction. 27.  I think that I can deal with the issues relating to the reception into evidence of the 3rd letter with considerably greater brevity.  Objection is taken by the prosecution upon the basis that the letter is self-serving and
is not a spontaneous expression in the face of an accusation made to the Accused.  There is some force in what is said on behalf
the prosecution because the letter was written many months after the Accused first faced the accusation that he was guilty of a conspiracy
to traffic in dangerous drugs with Lui Mei Yi and others.  Nevertheless, it does seem to me that in all the circumstances it would
promote and a degree of fairness and balance for the jury to have available to it the 3rd letter. That fairness and balance is a relevant part of the determination of the admissibility of such evidence is recognised in
Attorney General v Li Siu Lam [1989] 2 HKLR 370, 374.  I propose also to order that the 3rd letter be admitted into evidence subject to appropriate arrangements for redaction of certain parts.","10/1/17

done, or not as the case may be, by way of compliance with them.  If the Liquidators, consider KPMG HK do not have a legitimate excuse
for non-compliance the appropriate course is to commence contempt proceedings. 12.  I also have another more practical objection to the way in which the Liquidators wish to progress the matter.  If I have to decide
the summonses on the basis of the evidence filed to date, which is Mr Manzoni’s preferred course, I cannot see how I could be expected
to do other than make an order substantially in the terms of the first part of paragraph 27 of the February Decision, which would
not advance the matter very far; although I note in passing that there may be a material difference in the position in respect of
the audit working papers for the financial years up to and including 2007, when the audit was done by the KPMG HK and from 2008,
when as I understand the position, KPMG Huazhen carried out the audit on the Mainland as a component auditor.  If the question of
KPMG HK’s ability to direct KPMG Huazhen to take such steps as are necessary for KPMG HK to comply with the 2016 and 2017 Orders
is going to have to be resolved by further evidence and possibly cross-examination, particularly, having regard to the importance
of the Liquidators having access to the Documents and the nature of KPMG HK’s reasons for failure to comply, this should be by
way of contempt proceedings. 13.  In conclusion I will dismiss the two summonses.  I will make a costs order nisi that the costs are paid out of the assets of the Company with a certificate for two counsel.",Date of Hearing: 6 July 2017Date of Decision: 26 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

RE BRAR JASPREET SINGH [2017] HKCFI 1448; HCAL 37/2016 (26 July 2017),"13.  In her submission, Ms Poon seems to suggest that, due to the high standards of fairness required for the adjudication of non-refoulement
claims, the Adjudicator should be more reluctant to conclude that the Applicant was not telling the truth.  However, the high standards
of fairness only requires the Adjudicator and the Director to observe a high standard of procedural fairness in determining the non-refoulement
claim.  It does not mean that there should be preference on the part of the Adjudicator in believing the Applicant’s factual allegations.
 In my judgment, the Adjudicator had reasons to disbelieve the Applicant.  The high standards of fairness have been observed in this
case, and the Adjudicator was entitled to make the relevant factual findings. 14.  In the Decision, the Adjudicator has made it clear that credibility is an independent ground to reject the Applicant’s non-refoulement
claim.  As there is no room for the court to disturb the factual findings by the Adjudicator about the credibility of the claim,
the Applicant’s application for judicial review cannot possibly succeed.  In such circumstances, there is no need for me to deal
with the other issues such as whether the Applicant’s allegations are sufficient to establish the Risk of Torture, the Risk of
Harm or the Risk of Persecution for the purpose of the non-refoulement claim, or whether there are good reasons to extend the time
for the leave application. 15.  For the above reasons, I dismiss both the leave application and the time-extension application.  I also make an order that the Applicant’s

HKSAR v. LAM HING CHIT [2017] HKCFI 2435; [2018] 5 HKC 441; HCCC 75/2017 (26 July 2017),"21.  In my opinion, the impugned statement in paragraph 11 of the witness statement in the depositions of Ms Lui is not mere narrative.
 It is concerned with arrangements to pick up in Hong Kong drugs which had been packed on the mainland and to ensure that Ms Lui
understands the arrangements and the participants in the packing operation which were a prelude to its delivery.  In my judgement,
this is clearly a statement to advance the interests of the conspiracy. 22.  The only remaining question is whether the inability of counsel for the accused to cross-examine Fu Chai would be a proper basis
for the exclusion of the impugned passage.  I rather suspect that if Fu Chai was available, he would most likely be on the current
indictment as an accused and if that were the case his availability to the present accused for cross examination would depend on
exigencies of a joint trial and it would be by no means a sure thing that he would conduct his case in a manner which would expose
him to the cross examination of the present accused.  In my judgement the efficacy of cross-examining Fu Chai is a concept substantially
more apparent than real.  23.  Finally, in making the order that the impugned passage is admissible as an act or declaration in furtherance of the conspiracy,
I also make it plain that in the event that the evidence presents at trial in a manner which would mean that the factual underpinnings
of, in particular, my determination that there exist reasonable evidence that the impugned passage was an act or declaration in furtherance

proceedings and a related judicial review (together with the CE) in relation to Ms Lau, seeking declarations that the oath taken
by her was invalid and that she has been disqualified from entering the office of a LegCo Member.  By then, the applicant no doubt
has no more sufficient interest and locus in pursuing this judicial review, and the application should have been withdrawn by the applicant, failing which, be dismissed. 24.  For the above reasons, I would set aside the ex parte leave previously granted to the applicant and dismiss his leave application on the basis that the applicant does not have sufficient
locus to bring the present judicial review. 25.  There are no reasons why the applicant should not bear the costs of Ms Lau incurred in this judicial review,[4] including her costs (including counsel’s costs) incurred in preparing the hearing on 15 December 2016 and the written submissions
dated 20 December 2016 (and filed on 21 December 2016) to oppose the applicant’s locus.  I therefore so order.","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

that leave was required.  They left the matter to such a time where they were under time pressure, and so sought leave to appeal

DCB v. AB [2017] HKCFI 1396; HCMP 2173/2014 (28 July 2017),"27.  The parties did attempt mediation but there was no evidence that the mediation attempts were not successful by reason of the Father’s
attitude. 28.  As I have said, the Father did not have a hopeless case, and it was necessary at the time for him to invoke the court’s wardship
proceedings in order to try to bring L back to Hong Kong.  He had no ulterior motive and although the language he used in his affirmations
and his criticisms of the Mother indicated he is an emotive person, it could not be said that he had conducted the litigation in
relation to L’s care and control in a way other than bona fide in the best interests of L. 29.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I am unable to say the Father’s litigation conduct in relation to L’s
care and control was reprehensible, or beyond the band of what was reasonable.  Bearing in mind L is still young, and the parties
will need to continue to communicate over her welfare for years to come, I have come to the view that it is in L’s best interest
that there should be no order as to costs, including any reserved costs, save those already ordered, if any.  The Mother’s own

ignored them and refused to provide them with the details for payment. 49.  Finally, it is trite law that there are conditions to be satisfied before the court would imply any terms in a contract.[6]  The principal test remains one of necessity, and the question to be answered is whether the term is necessary to give effect to
the intention of the parties or to achieve the parties’ objective in entering into the contract rather than whether it is necessary
to make the contract work at all.[7] It is clear that the rights and obligations between the Plaintiff (lender), the 1st Defendant (borrower) and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (guarantors) are well regulated by the terms of the contracts made between them, to be supplemented by various legal principles
under the law of surety and guarantee.  There is simply no room for the court to imply any further terms as contended for by the
Defendants in the relevant loan facilities agreements.  There is also no factual basis to support that the Plaintiff was in breach
of some of these alleged implied terms, for example, the Plaintiff or its predecessor had misrepresented the financial position between
the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant or the Plaintiff had made premature demands for repayment of debt.[8] 50.  For the above reasons, the Defendants have failed to establish any triable issues either as to liability or quantum, and Master
Ho was right in granting summary judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.  I therefore dismiss the appeal. I also make a costs order

Xing’s application for costs is on the basis that they had the authority to remain as solicitors for SWT by virtue of their retainer
being an entire contract.  However, a party’s conduct in the carriage of the proceedings is a relevant matter to be taken into
account, when liability for costs are determined.  22.  In view of the lack of full and candid disclosure by BKT and Wen as to the status of SWT, the stance of the 2nd LC, and the stay of proceedings against SWT by virtue of its liquidation, and by virtue of the fact that court time and Xing’s

The following statements of principle are not controversial. This rule enables a court to review an earlier case management decision
relating to expert evidence. Although the rule existed even before the Civil Justice Reform (“CJR”), the exercise of discretion
under this rule should be guided by the objectives of the CJR.  The rule may be invoked irrespective of whether the previous order
was a consent order or an order made by the court. The circumstances pertaining when the previous order was made would be a relevant
consideration in deciding how the discretion under the rule ought to be exercised. Given this rule, it is unnecessary to resort to
the traditional ways[6] to challenge a previous consent order that has been made relating to expert evidence. The rule may be invoked by a party or on the
court’s own motion. 16.  The critical factor, which is clearly fact sensitive and requires further consideration in an appropriate case, is what constitutes
“sufficient cause” to revoke or vary a previous order made or direction given in relation to expert evidence.  Whether or not
there are fetters to the court’s exercise of discretion under this rule, such as proof of erroneous information at the time of
the original order or direction; or proof of subsequent event changing the basis on which the original order or direction was made;
or a need to establish some material change of circumstances, is best left to be debated when the appropriate case arises.  In this
case, I had requested the parties to explain why expert evidence on the condition of the road surface in question was not obtained
and, inferentially, to consider whether or not expert evidence on the condition of the road surface at the time of the accident ought
to be adduced.  Had Mr Azari been able to express an expert opinion on the subject, which would have been of assistance to me in
determining the condition of the road surface at the time of the accident, that would have constituted sufficient cause to enable
me to invoke the rule to vary the previous consent order made in this action in relation to expert evidence and to grant leave to
the parties to adduce expert evidence on this issue.  If the court seeks expert evidence to assist it and such expert evidence is
available and fulfils the criteria of admissibility, as expert evidence and conforming to the objectives of the CJR, then that would
constitute “sufficient cause” to vary a previous consent order made in the action in relation to expert evidence. 17.  The plaintiff has failed in his application to adduce expert evidence but has succeeded on the jurisdiction point.  The defendants
have succeeded in resisting the plaintiff’s application to adduce expert evidence but have failed on the jurisdiction point.  I
could make an order nisi as to costs that there be no order as to costs; or make an order nisi as to costs that the plaintiff pays the defendants’ costs on the application to adduce expert evidence to be taxed, if not agreed,
with certificate for 1 counsel and that the defendants pays the plaintiff’s costs on the jurisdiction point to be taxed, if not
agreed, with certificate for 1 counsel.  However, as I have caused the parties to incur these extra costs in the exercise of my case
management powers, I am minded to and I make an order nisi as to costs that the costs of the application be in the cause, with certificate for 1 counsel.",Dates of Hearing: 26 April 2017Date of Decision: 3 August 2017,"(Mohan Bharwaney)

LI SHEONG TEK v. CHEUNG KIU CHUN [2017] HKCFI 1373; HCSA 30/2017 (4 August 2017),"8.  The Claimant’s instant application for leave to appeal is only on the ground that the Order is erroneous in point of law.  9.  Having considered the Reasons for Decision, I do not accept that there is any basis to grant leave to appeal.  The Claimant is seeking
to challenge the findings made by the Adjudicator on the basis of her rejection of the Claimant’s credibility and evidence, and
her preference for the evidence given by the Defendant as to the Messages, the making of the Agreement, and what the Agreement related
to.  I fail to see how it can be said that the Adjudicator had ignored any evidence which would have any effect on the Decision or
on the Order.  Nor can I find any point of law on which the Adjudicator can be said to have erred, to raise any arguable appeal.
 10.  For the above reasons, I am not satisfied that the Claimant has established any reasonable ground of appeal which has any reasonable
prospects of success, and refuse to grant leave.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1373.html,"

MAI CUITING v. MAK CHUI FONG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1374; HCMP 2619/2016 (4 August 2017),"52.  In the present case, P only sought an estate account of which Ds had a duty to provide.  As pointed out by Mr Chan, she did not
seek a removal of Ds.  However, in my view, this does not mean that Ds could simply ignore preparation of the estate account.  Ds
should have responded to the 30.05.16 Letter from P’s solicitors by indicating a time frame as to when Ds would provide the estate
account to P.  There was no such indication.  Ds then seemed to change solicitors yet again.  Up to the Hearing, there was no evidence
that Ds had taken step to prepare estate account by that time. 53.  P succeeded with her application and she should be entitled to costs.  If her costs and Ds’ costs are ordered to be paid out of
the Estate this means P would have to bear 1/7 of not only her own costs but also 1/7 of Ds’ costs.  I do not see why P should
have to bear any part of her own costs or Ds’ costs.  54.  In any event, having considered all the circumstances in the present case, I have come to the view that Ds had defaulted in discharging
their duties as administrators, and should be personally liable for the costs of P’s successful claim against them, on indemnity
basis.  Ds should also be deprived of their own costs to be paid out of the Estate.",Date of Plaintiff’s Reply Submission on Costs: 21 July 2017Date of Decision: 4 August 2017,"(Bebe Pui Ying Chu)

"HKSAR v. MUNKH ERDENE, MUNKHZAYA [2017] HKCFI 1383; HCMA 325/2017 (4 August 2017)","9.  The Magistrate relied on the case, HKSAR v NARANKHUU Baljinnyam [4] where very similar facts were disclosed.  The Court in that case took the view that a starting point of 9 months was appropriate.
 As such, with the plea from the Appellant which allowed the Appellant to have 1/3 discount in sentence, the Magistrate sentenced
the Appellant to 6 months’ imprisonment. 10.  I cannot see any flaws in the reasoning and the basis of sentence as applied by the Magistrate.  In fact, it seems that there is
no evidence to say when did the Appellant arrive in Hong Kong, and her travelling pattern, if any.  To that end, the travel index
records of the Appellant should be tendered to provide certain background information of the Appellant.  If the Appellant committed
the present offence on the very day when she entered Hong Kong as a visitor, that can be taken as an aggravating factor.  There is
also no information as to the content of the handbag, other than the stolen property, carried by the Appellant.  If there was nothing
else, it can provide a strong inference that the Appellant carried the ‘anti‑anti‑theft’ handbag with the sole purpose of
shoplifting.  It may well be a crime involving syndicates. 11.  There are no valid grounds put forward by the Appellant against her sentence, and the appeal is accordingly dismissed.","andMUNKH ERDENE, MUNKHZAYA

his sister Madam Kwok had and has no beneficial interest in the Property.  That is sufficient to dispose of the Trustees’ application. 22.  The Trustees’ application is hereby dismissed. 23.

LONGLIFE INTERNATIONAL (HONG KONG) CO LTD v. MAY DELIGHT LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1381; HCA 2544/2016 (7 August 2017),"46.  For example, Ms Ho complained that even though the defendants argued that Shanghai courts are the proper forum to hear this case,
they knew on 1 April 2017 when they received the ruling of the Shanghai First Instance Court that it had no jurisdiction to hear
the case and concluded that Hong Kong courts have exclusive jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, they made the present application for a
stay on 3 April 2017.  Ms Ho also submitted that in breach of the requirements under Order 12, rule 8, the defendants had failed
to state its ground of stay and that they had failed to produce the rulings from the Shanghai courts declining jurisdiction.  47.  The way the defendants have conducted their case so far might be less than satisfactory but they did not result in any substantial
delay in the proceedings.  On the timing of filing of the present application, the defendants might be excused for doing so as they
were going to appeal the decision of the Shanghai First Instance Court.  Unless they made the stay application, they would have to
file their defence thereby losing the opportunity to challenge jurisdiction.  48.  In the premises, I order that the costs of this application be to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for

evidence upon which the prosecution could rely to ask the learned magistrate to draw an irresistible inference that she had no intention
to pay. 23.  I find that there was not only one irresistible inference which could be drawn from the facts as I have found them to be.  I do
not believe that sufficient consideration was given to the positive good character of this 53‑year‑old appellant, who as a nurse
has served the community her whole working life, nor to her previous attendance at Disneyland, her knowledge of it or the vast amounts
of money she expended there between 2014 and 2016.  Whilst I understand the need for Disneyland to implement a zero tolerance policy
to shop lifting, I take the view that there will always be exceptions to the rule and that the prosecution of this lady is tragic.
 She was a fan of Disneyland and clearly spent considerable amount of time there.  This prosecution has no doubt tainted irrevocably
her interest in it. 24.  For the reasons given above this appeal is allowed. The conviction is quashed and the sentence set aside.  Costs of the appeal be

of the opinions from the Mainland law experts and the full argument on the issues by both parties, I accept that the court should

of documents and depreciation of memories.  However, the Liquidators have provided an account of what happened since the last application
for extension of validity of the 1st and 2nd KPMG Protective Writs in Section C of Borrelli 3.  In the past 12 months or so, the Liquidators have been pressing KPMG to produce
documents.  It is fair to say that there was delay and obstruction on the part of KPMG making it difficult for the Liquidators to

of time should not be a factor to deny the Extension Applications.  In particular, there should be no destruction of documents given

"CHINA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (IN OFFICIAL LIQUATION) v. KPMG (A FIRM) [2017] HKCFI 1913; HCA 2276/2016 (8 August 2017)","30.  I am sure that such argument would be fully canvassed in the R 8A Applications in November.  At this stage, it suffices for me to
say that the concern of the Liquidators as stated in paras 41-45 of Borelli 4 deserves serious investigation.  Pending the availability
of the opinions from the Mainland law experts and the full argument on the issues by both parties, I accept that the court should
extend the validity of the Protective Writs pending full argument on the issue in the R 8A Applications. 31.  KPMG may also argue that the effluxion of time is too great and that further extension would cause difficulties because of the loss
of documents and depreciation of memories.  However, the Liquidators have provided an account of what happened since the last application
for extension of validity of the 1st and 2nd KPMG Protective Writs in Section C of Borrelli 3.  In the past 12 months or so, the Liquidators have been pressing KPMG to produce
documents.  It is fair to say that there was delay and obstruction on the part of KPMG making it difficult for the Liquidators to
carry out the investigation work.  The evidence at this stage shows that KPMG is responsible for such delay and so the effluxion
of time should not be a factor to deny the Extension Applications.  In particular, there should be no destruction of documents given
the preservation order in place by KPMG. 32.  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the validity of the Protective Writs should be extended to June 2018 which provides a
reasonable time for the carrying out of the investigation work.  However, I must warn that the Liquidators cannot expect to have
indefinite extension of the validity of the Protective Writs.  Any further extension applications would have to be closely scrutinised
by the court in the future.","KPMG (A FIRM)

 However, as both parties have been legally represented for most of the time during the 5 years, I cannot be sure if the plaintiff
should be solely held reasonable from the time taken. 23.  As such, I will adopt the usual approach.  For general damages (PSLA), the plaintiff is entitled to interest at 2% per annum from
the date of writ to the date hereof.  Regarding pre‑trial loss of earnings and special damages, there be half judgment rate from
the date of accident to the date hereof. 24.  I will also make a costs order nisi.  The plaintiff is entitled to costs of the assessment, including costs reserved on party‑and‑party
basis, at District Court scale, to be taxed if not agreed.  As the plaintiff was absent at the assessment, there will be no order
as to costs regarding the hearing before me on 24 July 2017, notwithstanding I am indebted to the assistance from Mr. Lim. The plaintiff’s

AIA INTERNATIONAL LTD v. APPEALS TRIBUNAL OF THE HONG KONG FEDERATION OF INSURERS AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1411; HCAL 163/2015 (11 August 2017),"3.  In the exercise of the court’s discretion, although the starting point is that costs generally follow the event, it is entitled
to deprive a successful party of whole or part of its costs because it had caused a significant increase in the length or costs of
the proceedings by raising issues on which it was unsuccessful, even where it was not unreasonable for that party to have raised
those issues.  A court will exercise its discretion in this regard, depending on all the circumstances and with due circumspection
so as not to undermine the utility of the general rule that costs follow the event.  See Commissioner of Inland Revenue v HIT Finance Ltd (No 2) [2008] HKCFA 57; [2014] 4 HKLRD 412, at paragraph 7 per Bokhary PJ, and Zhuhai International Container Terminals (Jiuzhou) Ltd v Lo Hong Hoi, CACV 181/2011, 31 July 2012, unreported, at paragraph 33 per Kwan JA.  4.  The respondents accept that in the present case they fall into the category as described by Lam VP in Orrico Philippe for the reason that they actively opposed the judicial review. The respondents seek, however, to argue that the costs that the applicant
would otherwise be entitled to should be apportioned on the basis that it was unsuccessful on its argument that the IARB was not
entitled to make an order requiring payment.  That is not correct.  The applicant accepted the practice of the IARB or the Appeals
Tribunal to require an insurer to repay premiums and cancel or reinstate policies as a result of the misconduct of an insurer’s
agent.  They took issue with the payment in the present case as being outside the terms of the accepted practice, which remains to
be resolved as explained in this Court’s judgment. 5.  In the circumstances of the present case, after weighing the arguments on costs, I do not consider that it is appropriate to deprive
the applicant of any of its costs.  I therefore order that the respondents pay the applicant’s costs to be taxed if not agreed.","Ms Tsui Ming Lo

consideration of the evidence relevant to that issue.  Ms Wong submits that, having regard to the arguments advanced by the prosecution
before the Magistrate, he correctly answered Question (2).  I do not accept this submission.  If one were to look at the position
as it was at the time of the Magistrate’s determination on 30 January 2015, for reasons mentioned above, I am of the view that
the Magistrate ought to have considered himself bound by the decision of Poon J and ruled accordingly. In any event, this court has
now before it the judgments of the Court of Appeal and Court of Final Appeal and must be guided by those judgments when deciding
how the present appeal should be disposed of. 28.  For the foregoing reasons, I hold that:- 29.  Accordingly, the Magistrate’s answer to Question (2) is set aside, and that question is remitted to another magistrate for fresh
consideration.  I have been given to understand by Mr Man that the prosecution may apply to the magistrate for an adjournment of
the fresh determination of Question (2) pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings mentioned above.  Although this appears
to me to be an appropriate course to take, it is a case management issue to be decided by the magistrate assigned to deal with this

RE TIN WAN TUNG [2017] HKCFI 1432; HCCW 250/2016 (11 August 2017),"67.  I am fully aware of the principles that winding up proceeding is only to be invoked for plain and obvious cases and that where there
are genuine disputes on facts, it is not appropriate to issue a winding up order.  It is also not the court’s function to try a
case on affidavit evidence.  It is unusual for the court to embark on an analysis of disputes of facts on affidavit evidence only,
particularly as it involves allegations of fraud and misrepresentation which require a very high standard of proof.  However, for
reasons as already explained, despite an extremely cautious approach, I come to the provisional view that Tin has made out a strong
case that he was induced into executing the documents by reason of Wong’s misrepresentations.  Tin is entitled to a winding up
order. 68.  Besides, the facts of this case cry out for a winding-up order to be made. Tin was induced into transferring his flat for 8% shareholding
in Mega City, which most likely is nothing but a piece of paper.  Wong strongly resisted disclosure of the financial documents of
Mega City.  Tin’s flat was transferred to Fully Fortune, which was almost immediately mortgaged.  There is no evidence about the
business of that company and its assets.  What is known is that Fully Fortune has been repeatedly mortgaging the flat for the past
ten years and received the proceeds of the mortgage in a huge lump sum but has been unable to pay the small instalments.  Now Wong
has openly admitted that he and his Companies are unable to pay even a small petitioning debt.  Where has the mortgage loan gone
and who else but Wong could have pocketed it? Coincidentally, when Tin commenced legal action, Fully Fortune stopped making repayments.
 Dah Sing Bank has obtained judgment against Fully Fortune and will sell Tin’s flat to recover the mortgage loan.  The net result
would be that Tin will lose his flat with Wong pocketing the mortgage loan.  This is a case which cries out loud and clear of fraud
or misrepresentation.  All that is said is about the main action which on the face has nothing to do with this petition.  But, if
the Companies are insolvent, why should they   be allowed to continue their business incurring further costs for themselves in pursuing
a hopeless counterclaim and causing their victim to incur more legal costs for what would most likely turn out to be an empty judgment. 69.  For the reasons I have given, I come to the conclusion that the Companies have failed to show a bona fide counterclaim on substantial ground which would be equal to or would exceed the indisputable petitioning debt.  In the circumstances,
the proper course is for the Companies to be wound up.  I therefore make the usual winding up order with costs to the petitioner,

set aside.  I assess the amount of GMI’s proof of debt at US$6,666,519.09.  Had Wu properly assessed GMI’s proof of debt, the
debt owed to GMI would have far outweighed the aggregate of all other creditors’ claims and Mr Pang’s appointment as liquidator
would not have been approved.  His appointment must also be set aside.  East China should reconvene a creditors’ meeting in accordance
with the terms of the order to be made hereunder.  34.  Accordingly, I grant the plaintiff an order in terms of sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of paragraph 1 above and a further order

unsecured debt. 11.  The remaining matter is the costs of the hearing before me today.  Ms Ling, who appears for the liquidators, asks that those costs
are paid by the Company as the only reason why it has been necessary for counsel to attend court is to deal with the issue that I
have just considered.  It seems to me, reading the correspondence between the parties, that this is a fair characterisation of the
circumstances in which it has been necessary for counsel to appear before the court rather than for the court simply to dismiss the
petition in the normal way without requiring the attendance of representatives of either party.  12.  I will therefore order that the costs of today are paid by the Company to the Petitioner.  In addition there are the Official Receiver’s
costs which will be paid out of the Petitioner’s deposit and which I assess in the sum of $5,300.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1665.html,"

the Customs & Excise officer speaking to him had said he had never been told that, he then replied that he must have said it
himself.  “I hate people,” he said, “who take white powder”.  Then he asked to be allowed to help in this situation because
Fei Sing had taken advantage of him and his integrity. 20.  I have had the opportunity—and it is a considerable advantage — of having considered the evidence over a number of days.  I
have, obviously, to be very careful in my approach not to usurp the functions of a jury.  The test that has to be applied which is
referred to in Secretary for Justice v Tang Sau Ling [2013] HKCA 251; [2013] 2 HKLRD 174, applicable to this kind of application, is whether a jury, properly directed, could, may or might conclude that the only reasonable
inference to be reached on all the evidence is that the defendant’s account was a false one and to cover his knowledge that the
package contained drugs. 21.  I have decided, on reflection, that this is a matter for the jury and, accordingly, the application is dismissed.",Date of Ruling: 14 August 2017(M. Stuart Moore),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1919.html,"

"RE CHAN KIN MAN, EDDIE [2017] HKCFI 1472; HCMP 1260/2017 (16 August 2017)","1.  This application is in my view misconceived. It seeks an order for the voluntary liquidation of the company to be permanently stayed,
but the voluntary winding up, begun by a special resolution of the members in 1996, had long been completed. A return of the final
general meeting was filed and registered by the Registrar of Companies on 5 May 1997. It follows that the company was dissolved 3
months later, in August 1997, pursuant to s 239(4) of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32). 2.  Upon dissolution, a company ceases to exist as a legal entity: Integrated Marketing Communications Ltd v Registrar of Companies [2015] HKCFI 1726; [2015] 5 HKLRD 362.  There are no further winding up proceedings in existence to be stayed under s 209 or otherwise dealt with.  The company is not being wound up any more.  An order for a permanent stay of winding up cannot be made
in these circumstances.  This defect in the motion has been drawn to the attention of the applicant by the Registrar of Companies,
who suggested that a prior application under s 290 might be more appropriate, but those acting for the applicant have paid no heed.  The motion must accordingly be dismissed.","Date of Judgment: 16 August 2017(Godfrey Lam)

D’s claim on quantum meruit is not simply based on introduction of the clients referred by P but also services provided in handling their cases.  The parties were not equal in blameworthiness or culpability in that under Rule 4, D would be the one who was in breach of rules
and D ought to know the rules.  Even though the capacity in which P worked in D’s firm is disputed, D’s case is that P’s role
was to liaise with D’s clients, to collect documents from clients and to find new clients for D’s firm mainly on personal injuries
cases[19].  P should be allowed to pursue a claim for reasonable remuneration for the services provided by him.  I am not prepared to dismiss
or strike out P’s claim on the basis of quantum meruit. 69.  For the reasons stated above, both Questions 1 (a) and (b) should be answered in the affirmative.

not having notice of the demand notice was not a result of any neglect on her part.  He noted in particular that she did not have
a lock on her mailbox and this neglect on her part would have attributed to her not receiving notice of the demand notice.  I reject
this submission. It is not uncommon not to have a lock on your mailbox and it will depend on the situation and circumstances of the
mailbox and the building in which it is located.  As explained by the appellant, she resides in a secure building where the number
of flats is small and where misdirected mail has only occurred on two or three occasions.  15.  I am of the view that in light of the additional evidence and in the circumstances of the case, the demand notice did not come to
the appellant’s attention because of any neglect on her part. 16.  For the reasons that I have given, I would allow the appeal and would rescind the order for the appellant to pay the additional
penalty of $320 plus the costs of $440.  I note that the appellant has paid these sums which I order should be repaid to her. ",Date of Hearing: 17 August 2017Date of Judgment: 17 August 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

allow the appeal and proceed to consider the quantum of security for costs that I should order. 37.  Base on the skeleton bill provided by the defendants[19], the solicitors costs incurred up to October 2016 is HK$1,292,257.00 and the estimated costs up to conclusion of trial is HK$1,256,863.00.
 The total disbursement, largely consisting of counsel fees and expert fee, is HK$2,464,500.00.  The total sum is thus HK$5,013,620.00.
 Mr Lam SC acknowledged that this court can take a broad-brush approach and needs not order full security.  He fairly asked the court
to assess and order what this court considers as reasonable security for costs.  In the end, I consider that HK$2 million is a reasonable
sum to be ordered as security for costs. 38.  I make the following orders:",Date of Judgment:  18 August 2017(Jason Pow SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2017/1483.html,"

HKSAR v. AHMED SHAMIR [2017] HKCFI 1490; HCCC 176/2016 (18 August 2017),"17.  I do not accept that the defendant was coached at all, at least not in the sense that any C&E officer told him what to say and
provided him with information about which the defendant had absolutely no prior knowledge.  Although it was not canvassed with any
of the officers, I accept it is possible that conversations took place in the intervening period, conversations which the defendant
alluded to in evidence and in which the defendant volunteered all sorts of information which was happily received by the C&E
team.  I say this because the defendant said he had spoken with C&E over those two days.  He is generally effusive.  He was effusive
in interview and in evidence.  It is difficult to control him once in full flow.  This can be seen on the VRI and was evident in
court.  It is possible that the defendant believes that anything he said during that time was the subject of what he likes to term
“coaching” whereas and in fact it was simply a one‑way flow of information which the C&E accepted and no doubt, urged him
to repeat under interview. 18.  I come to this view because the defendant made it clear under cross examination that he only gave in interview information he agreed
with (whether that was coached or not) and where he disagreed with it, he did not say it.  Two matters arise from that.  Firstly,
that he appears to have conceded that what he said was correct to his knowledge (although the issue of the truthfulness of his statements
is not to be decided upon here) and secondly, he chose when to comply with the provision of information to C&E and when not to.
 The first matter suggests that the information came directly from the defendant himself as the C&E could not have had such detailed
information within their own knowledge at that stage of the investigation and secondly, he acted wholly voluntarily.  Any inducement,
if made, was not operative, as he made it clear that he refused to say that he had knowledge as to the contents of the parcel which
he maintained is what the C&E wished him to do. 19.  Accordingly, I do not find that any admissions against interest made within the VRI VDP121, have been made involuntarily.  I find
the VRI Exh VDP109, VDP121a and VDP121b prima facie admissible subject to an application as to editing matters which are either submitted to be irrelevant or where their prejudicial
effect may outweigh their probative value.","CO 9892

HKSAR v. LEE WANG KAM [2017] HKCFI 1510; HCCC 172/2016 (21 August 2017),"9.  On 9 June 2014, the Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 revised the sentencing tariffs for a person convicted of trafficking of Ice as contained in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125.  The narcotic content of Ice of 14.3 g falls within the band of 10 to 70 g where the sentence after trial ranges from 7 to 11 years’
imprisonment.  For this quantity of drugs, a starting point of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is adopted.  10.  On 2 September 2016, the Court of Appeal revised the practice of affording discounts of sentence for guilty pleas in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] HKCA 397; [2016] 5 HKLRD 1.  It was noted by the Court of Appeal that the revised practice would not apply in respect of cases in the Court of First Instance
where trial dates had already been fixed.  This case was fixed for trial on 23 May 2016 and therefore the previous practice applies.
 Under the previous practice, a defendant would usually be entitled to the normal one third discount when the plea of guilty was
entered on the first day of trial: HKSAR v Lo Chi Yip and Another [2000] HKCA 211; [2000] 3 HKLRD 270, 276C-277J; and HKSAR v Ting Chiu and Another [2003] HKCA 41; [2003] 3 HKLRD 378, [17], [21] to [23].  Accordingly, the defendant will be given the normal one third discount for his plea of guilty.  11.  The starting point of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment will therefore be reduced by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea
to 4 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearings: 27 June and 21 August 2017Date of Sentence: 21 August 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

WAH SUN HONG LTD v. WONG LEE YUK PING AGNES [2017] HKCFI 1502; HCA 333/2016 (22 August 2017),"21.  The final complaint relates to the lack of particulars for the fraud claim, which is mainly formulated in §§11, 12 and 23 of the
Amended Statement of Claim: 22.  The Defendant raised the complaint relating to the lack of particulars for the fraud claim for the first time in the written submissions
filed for the hearing of the striking out application, and so the Plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to deal such complaint
in the opposing affirmations.  In any event, assuming that the Plaintiff’s factual allegations were to be accepted by the court,
there is certainly a prima facie case that the Defendant had obtained money from the Plaintiff in a fraudulent manner.  If the Defendant thinks that insufficient
particulars have been included in the pleading, the proper way is for her to ask for further and better particulars in support of
such claim.  At this stage, the Plaintiff’s fraud claim is one capable of being pursued and so I refuse to strike out the fraud
claim pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim. 23.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the striking out application.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of the application, including the costs of the application for leave to adduce the Affirmations of Chieng and Mak,
be to the Plaintiff in any event with certificate for 2 counsel, which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing

deleterious effect on him, the court will require good and cogent evidence, such as production of documentary proof, in support of
such a contention (see: Star Play Development Ltd v Bess Fashion Management Co Ltd [2002] HKCFI 594; [2007] 5 HKC 84 §9, Ma J (as he then was); and Leo Innotech (Holding) Ltd v Lee Shung Chi, HCA 474/2015, unrep, 13 October 2016, §4). 22.  I accept Mr Khaw’s submission that this is only a bare assertion which is not supported by any particulars, not to mention any
documentary evidence.  There is simply no particulars or evidence from the Debtor regarding the volume of his practice or even an
approximate number of his clients which may be affected by the cessation of his practice (if it occurs at all). 23.  For the above reasons, the Debtor has failed to show any reason to oppose the Petition.  I therefore made the usual bankruptcy order

in respect of Bankrupt’s Estate. In any event, the Son had not given any consideration for any future interest, and would not be
able to enforce such voluntary benefit made without deed against the Grantors/Trustees. 59.  For all of the above reasons, I find the TiB was correct in deciding that the Property was within the Bankrupt’s Estate. There
had been much discussion in the affirmation evidence and witness statements in relation to Wong Siu Lun’s proof of debt and/or
the TiB’s accounting inaccuracy in respect of the Estate account. I have carefully considered those matters, but they did not appear
to be relevant for the determination of the Summons. Indeed, neither the Bankrupt nor Mr Chan canvassed those matters in their submissions. 60.  In the circumstances, the Summons is dismissed. There shall be a costs order nisi that half of the costs of the Summons (including all costs reserved if any) be paid by the Bankrupt personally to the TiB to be taxed
if not agreed. In coming to the view that the TiB should be entitled to only half of the costs of the Summons, I note (a) there was
no cogent evidence before this court that the TiB had explained the reasons for their decision in relation to the Living Trust Agreement
to the Bankrupt prior to Mr Chan’s written submissions, and (b) it was only at the Hearing (but not even in Mr Chan’s written
submissions) that the TiB conceded the Bankrupt had locus to bring the application.",Date of Handing Down Decision: 24 August 2017(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1514.html,"

the narcotic content of drugs involved in this case, I adopt a starting point of 7 years and 9 months’ imprisonment, which I reduce
by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea to 5 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.  12.  Taking into account the totality principle and the circumstances of the defendant, I order that the sentence for the possession
offence run concurrently to the sentence for the trafficking offence.  I have borne in mind that the drugs found in the defendant’s
possession, had they been included in the trafficking offence would not have made a marked difference to the sentence that I would

HKSAR v. CHRISTOPHER HODGSON POON [2017] HKCFI 1527; HCMA 162/2017 (25 August 2017),"13.  Given the lack of direct evidence as to the knowledge and belief of the appellant and the circumstances of the case, the decision
by the appellant not to testify or call any evidence in the trial cannot be faulted.  He has conducted his case reasonably and in
accordance with his legal entitlements and for the above reasons, the fact that he did not give any further details about the agent
was neither here or there and could not be regarded as having brought suspicion upon himself or misleading the prosecution into thinking
their case was stronger than it was. 14.  For the above reasons, I disagree with the respondent who submitted that there was clear evidence before the magistrate for him
to conclude that the appellant had in fact brought suspicion upon himself.  On the contrary, in my view, there is no sound basis
for saying that the appellant had brought suspicion upon himself when the prosecution evidence only revealed that he submitted the
cover note to support his application to transfer the ownership of a vehicle in the Transport Department and that was all the prosecution
case was about. 15.  Accordingly, I will allow this appeal to award costs of the trial to the appellant to be taxed, and I also award the appellant his

Counsel for the Creditor argued that any contradiction between allowing the Creditor’s costs as an expense, and as a provable
non-preferential debt, as referred to in the judgment in Cooke v Dunbar, can be reconciled to the extent that the Creditor should be permitted to prove for any of its unpaid costs.  In reality, it is difficult
to envisage how such a situation can arise whereby a petitioning creditor would have to compete with the other creditors for the
balance of any costs which could not be paid in full.  If there are sufficient assets, the Petition Costs would be paid first, in
full, before the claims of other creditors are considered for distribution.  If the petitioning Creditor cannot be paid in full first,
if and when other assets are collected, the petitioning Creditor and the OR will still be entitled to payment of any balance of their
unpaid costs from such assets, before the claims of the other creditors are considered and paid on pari passu basis.  21.  Since the Creditor is to be paid the Petition Costs in full, it is not unjust that it should not be entitled to a vote on matters

summons, Ds ask for indemnity costs against P.  This Court has to take into consideration of Ds’ obligation of putting forth the
proper use order to Master K. Lo, bringing her attention to the agreed terms and the excluded days under Order 3 RHC.  Obviously,
Ds had not discharged the duties.  However, after the “unless order” had been made, P asked Ds not to perfect the Order, which
they disagreed and immediately sealed the Order.  The conducts of the parties after the Order have to be taken into consideration
under O.62, r.5, RHC.  On the other hand, P has failed in its application for setting aside Master K. Lo’s Order.  The appropriate
costs order for P’s application should be no order as to costs. 33.  As to the costs for Ds’ summons, the costs should follow the event.  Costs of this summons are granted to P assessed summarily

ME v. CYM [2017] HKCFI 1561; [2017] 4 HKLRD 739; HCMP 1624/2017 (30 August 2017),"85.  Based on my ruling on habitual residence, it is not necessary for me to consider the Article 13(b) defence.  However, I am of the
view that the evidence adduced by the Mother is not sufficient to satisfy the high threshold for such kind of defence.  Firstly,
it is also always possible for the Mother to seek proper relief from the English court, including financial relief to enable her
to stay in the UK and appropriate access arrangement.  In respect of her right to stay in the UK, I am sure that the HK Central Authority
can liaise with the English Central Authority to make temporary arrangement to enable the Mother to stay in the UK for any matrimonial
proceedings if such need arises.  Secondly, it is not sufficient for the Mother to simply assert that she does not have the means
to stay in the UK.  The facts of the present case indicate that the parties might have obtained some financial assistance from their
families.  Hence, more materials need to be supplied to the court to substantiate her allegation about the lack of means to stay
in the UK for any matrimonial proceedings.  In any event, my ruling on such defence is now academic. 86.  Based on my finding on habitual residence, I refused the Father’s application for the return of the Child.  I now make a costs
order nisi that there be no order as to costs of the present proceedings and there be legal aid taxation for the costs of both parties. Such

that the business is sold quickly and that in the circumstances the way in which the provisional liquidators have proceeded and the
offer that they propose to accept are within the range of reasonable procedures and price.  9.  So far as the facts of this particular application are concerned, it would in any event appear from the evidence that has been filed
that the price that the prospective purchaser has agreed to pay is right at the upper end of the range of indicative prices that
the prospective purchasers introduced by B have suggested.  Mr Maurellet SC submitted that the court should adjourn the application
in order that the provisional liquidators could allow a short period in order for alternative bids to be obtained.  There is, however,
no indication from B that there is any other prospective purchaser which is willing to pay more than the current offer, or submit
a compliant bid which would involve producing evidence of an ability to complete within the kind of time frame the provisional liquidators
require which in the sale agreement before me is within five working days of sanction by the court.  Therefore, as a matter of practicality,

orally in court referred to the sides of the breasts while in the Statement of Findings she confined herself to the sides of the
chest.  The difference between “chest” and “breasts” is rather small and people often refer to the breasts as the chest.
 While it is desirable to spell out specifically whether it was the sides of the chest or the breasts which were touched, the parts
of the body referred to were so close to each other that they are no doubt inherently sexual in nature.  No matter it was the sides
of the chest or breasts there was no significant impact on the findings of the magistrate.   33.  Ground of appeal (c) fails. 34.

The tariff guideline for trafficking in this quantity of Ice is set out in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691. It fixes a tariff for a narcotic content of over 600 g of Ice of 18 years’ imprisonment and upwards and further provides that for
very large quantities of over 600 g the principles laid down in HKSAR v Abdallah [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKLRD 437 should apply.  So far as material, it fixes a tariff guideline for 1,200 to 4,000 g of Ice of 23 to 26 years’ imprisonment.  10.  Based on the narcotic content of the drug of 1,920 g and the circumstances of the case, I would adopt a starting point of 23 years
and 9 months’ imprisonment which I would reduce by one third for the defendant’s guilty plea to 15 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.
 I will further reduce the sentence by 10 months because of the role played by the defendant in this crime and his cooperation with
the police at the time of his arrest as well as the view that I have taken as to his background and circumstances which led him to
commit an offence that he would not have otherwise had committed.  11.  Accordingly, the defendant is sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1578.html,"

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. MO SHAU WAH AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1607; HCA 353/2013 (6 September 2017),"32.  However, I take a different view of the 1st defendant's application for leave to appeal in relation to paragraph 1 of the summons.
 For the reasons I set out in my judgment, I do not consider that the terms of the varied injunction order required that CPSL act
as instructed by the terms of the 1st defendant solicitors letter of 19 May 2017 and therefore it cannot be said that (by not acting as instructed) they were “obstructing and/or impeding” the carrying out of the order.  I view the case for appeal of the 1st defendant as regards paragraph 1 as no more than fanciful and accordingly decline to grant leave.  33.  Finally, I would observe that the draft notice of appeal annexed to the 1st defendant's application would appear to require further
consideration by counsel before filing.  Currently it seeks only the setting aside of my judgment below and does not indicate the
precise relief sought as a consequence which is a necessary requirement in accordance with order 59 rule 3(2) RHC. 34.  Though the 1st defendant has only in part succeeded with its application for leave to appeal I order that the costs of the application
be costs in the cause of the appeal.",Date of Judgment: 6 September 2017(David N Francis),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1607.html,"

bank transactions that occurred in Vietnam.  When I inquired of Mr Choy whether a statement had been obtained from the brother, he
informed me that one had not been obtained.  He also intimated to me that he was unsure whether the brother would give evidence at

legal advisors can give comprehensible and reliable advice as to the likely consequences of an application being unsuccessful, in
order that the prospective applicant can weigh whether or not it considers it appropriate to make the application and risk an immediate
adverse costs order.  29.  My own preference is for a robust and clear approach.  It seems to me generally that when faced with an application such as an application
for the appointment of interim receivers, the position will be that if the application is unsuccessful, the applicant will pay the
costs, and pay the costs forthwith unless it can be demonstrated that there is reason to think that at the conclusion of the proceedings,
the trial judge may be persuaded that that is an unfair order to make.  30.  In the present case, it does not seem to me that the application falls into the speculative category, although, as will be apparent
from my reasons, it seems to me that the application should have been seen long before this hearing to be weak.  In the circumstances,

CHEN HONGQING v. MI JINGTIAN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1619; HCMP 962/2017 (8 September 2017),"16.  In this case, the appointment of receivers was ordered as an interim measure granted under s 45 of the Arbitration Ordinance (“Ordinance”), to preserve the status quo and to facilitate the process of the arbitral tribunal.  This was the application made by the OS,
which can be described as “the cause” in Hong Kong.  The order made for the appointment of receivers is sufficiently self-contained
and severable from the determination of the dispute between the parties in the arbitration, and I concluded on 27 June 2017 that
the Plaintiff had established the merits for the grant of the order sought.  Ordering that the costs of the application for the interim
measure made under the Ordinance should be paid by the Defendants to the successful Plaintiff is more appropriate than to order that
the costs should await the outcome of the arbitration, and the tribunal’s determination on the merits of the dispute referred to
arbitration. 17.  Since the Intervener applied to intervene and to oppose the Plaintiff’s application for interim measures, and did at the hearing
of the OS argue (unsuccessfully) against the grant of the interim measures sought, it is fair that the costs of the Plaintiff’s
application by the OS should be paid by the Intervener, jointly and severally with the Defendants. 18.  The Order Nisi will accordingly be varied to provide that:",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1619.html,"

and was given more.  There was a professional mediator to help the couple.  I am of the view that the Husband (who had flexible working
hours as a consultant) should be given as much access as possible.  I therefore extended the terms of access. 44.  The Husband and his lawyers had used their best endeavours to try and persuade the Wife to do what was in the best interests of
the Children.  But for her indication of consent, the present application would have ended at the pre-trial review.  The Wife did

bearing in mind the fact the applicant himself delayed in making the application for leave to apply for judicial review (see paragraph
93 of the judgment). 11.  Fourth, it is clear that the Judgment will give rise to some far reaching implications.  As pointed out in the course of the hearing,
although this action is strictly between the applicant on the one hand and the Government (through the respondents) on the other,
as a matter of practical reality, it is to be expected that the Judgment, once it is given effect, will be applied not only to the
applicant but also to other civil servants in a similar situation.  Considerable confusion and difficulties will arise if the Judgment
is now given effect, only for it to be overturned by the Court of Appeal a few months later.  Consider, for example, the situation
where the applicant, or some other civil servants in a similar situation, should decide to take advantage of housing benefits offered
by the Government to “married” couples and move into departmental quarters provided by the Government, only to find a few months
later that they will cease to receive the housing benefits because the Judgment is reversed by the Court of Appeal. Other serious
consequences may also arise from a reversal of the Judgment in so far as it impacts on the operation of the regulation against double
housing benefits applicable to a civil servant and his/her “spouse”, as mentioned in paragraph 17 of the second affidavit of
Tse Wing Yee Winnie.  Further, there could be issues arising as to whether the Government is entitled to recover benefits given or
made available to the applicant and his partner, or other civil servants in a similar situation, during the period between now and
the handing down of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and that could lead to further litigations. 12.  For the above reasons, I would have granted the extension of time sought by the 1st respondent in any event even if the 1st respondent had not offered the Revised Undertaking.  I consider that the costs of the 1st respondent’s summons, including the costs of the hearing on 7 September 2017, should be in the cause of the Appeal.  The applicant’s
own costs are to be taxed in accordance with legal aid regulations.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1628.html,"

HKSAR v. WONG KWONG WAI [2017] HKCFI 1630; [2018] 1 HKC 207; HCMA 118/2017 (11 September 2017),"3.  This charge based upon only the particulars in the charge would not have allowed the magistrate to give a proper assessment as to
sentence.  The reason being there are a wide variety of circumstances in which this offence could have been committed, for example,
it could have been a stone falling because the appellant was doing repairs outside of his home and was careless or it could have
been a stone which had fallen due to disrepair etc. It is therefore incumbent upon the prosecution to supply the court with brief
facts as to where the stone fell from, in what circumstances, and was it due to the appellant’s negligence or did the incident
happen due to a lack of supervision or care.  Also of particular importance was the size of the stone and whether it had fallen from
the balcony of the appellant’s apartment, the window or the wall etc. 4.  Hence, it is of the utmost importance that this absence of brief facts is an isolated incident and hopefully both the prosecution,
the police and the court will be vigilant to stop this from happening again. 5.  In the circumstances I allowed the appellant to appeal against his conviction out of time and set aside his conviction due to the
absence of facts upon which to base his conviction.  His sentence was also set aside.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1630.html,"

TSOI CHIK SANG LAWRENCE AND OTHERS v. TASTY CATERING GROUP LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1637; HCMP 812/2017 (12 September 2017),"93.  On the evidence adduced, this case cries out for the appointment of receivers.  First and foremost, the absence of a properly constituted
board of a company that is actively trading alone would be sufficient reason.  The shareholder dispute (which is unlikely to be resolved
in the near future) creates an insuperable obstacle in the way of resolving the problem by convening a meeting of members to appoint
the directors.  Meanwhile, HHCS continues to be in breach of its statutory obligations that are criminal offences, a state of affairs
that should not be allowed to continue.   94.  The practical solution lies in the appointment of receivers.  It would enable applications to be made for a meeting to be held limited
to the presentation of financial statements, director’s reports etc to meet the statutory obligations. 95.  In my view, when that is coupled with uncertainty over share capital, the possibility of dilution having taken place and jeopardy
to HHCS’s assets, the case for the exercise of the court’s discretion was overwhelming.  The respondents have not been able to
put forward any good reason for not making the appointment that would outweigh those considerations.  In the circumstances, the court
had no hesitation in making the appointment.",(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1637.html,"

During the course of submissions when dealing with the objections to various exhibits, a number of proposed exhibits had been removed
by the prosecution.  I must say that the exercise of examining the relevance of these materials has been extremely difficult because
of the confusing nature and changing position of the prosecution case, and the recent flow of additional evidence that the prosecution
wish to rely on at trial.  In respect of the following remaining exhibits, I have set out my remarks concerning the nature and relevance
of the exhibit in question and whether to allow or disallow its admission into evidence.  34.  I should point out that a significant portion of the objected material concerns discussions or meetings of a group or individuals
in relation to demonstrations and political activities.  There are at times comments about tactics and actions to be employed at
public events or directed to identified targets.  In light of the charges that have been laid against the defendants and the prosecution

should be disallowed.  It seems that she has not challenged the law costs draftsman’s hourly rate at $1,600. 43.  I maintain my ruling and reject the plaintiff’s review for this item since almost all items in the bill could not be agreed or
narrowed down by the parties before the hearing, which would no doubt heavily burden the defendant’s law costs draftsman with the
preparation for the taxation. 44.  To conclude, I order that the plaintiff’s application for review be dismissed.  As costs shall follow events, I further order

HKSAR v. CHAN YIU SHING [2017] HKCFI 1663; HCMA 377/2016 (18 September 2017),"22.  In the present case, the liquids in question were not offensive weapons per se, as the magistrate clearly pointed out[13], therefore the court must make a finding on the purpose of the possession of such liquids before ruling on whether such liquids were
offensive weapons.  In the present case, having heard the overall evidence and before making the foregoing determination, the court
could not ignore the innocent account given by the Applicant.  The effect of the Applicant’s account was not confined to whether
there was a reasonable excuse, it also related to whether the liquids in his possession were offensive weapons.  Certainly, the court
could not directly determine the liquids to be offensive weapons merely because the Applicant’s exculpatory account was disbelieved,
the whole of the evidence must be taken into consideration in determining whether the court could be sure that the possessor had
the unlawful intent as stated in the legislation.  The magistrate clearly stated that the burden of proof was nonetheless on the
prosecution[14]. Furthermore, the magistrate’s approach in the present case was correct, and was clearly distinguishable from the questionable
approach in Lee Shing-po[15] cited by Mr. Cheung in the appeal and in this application.  I am not satisfied that this argument raised by the Applicant meets the
standard of having great and general importance.  The relevant laws, including the burden and the standard of proof of the issues
of whether an article is an offensive weapon and whether there is any reasonable excuse, are very clear. There is nothing that needs
clarification. 23.  I will not certify this point of law for the following reasons: 24.  According to this definition, what was to be determined by the court is the intention of the person in possession or in control
of the article in question, there was no objective consideration.  I am of the view that this point is not reasonably arguable[19], it does not meet the standard for granting a certificate.[20]",(A Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1663.html,"

what causes of action there may be against which persons, and that in an application for private examination the trustees need not
formulate a cause of action.  If a person is shown to be holding pre-bankruptcy assets for the bankrupt, an action by the trustees
(in whom all such assets have vested) might be an action to recover trust property and might be free from limitation (see also §27
of the 2016 Reasons). 29.  Lastly, the Sisters allege that the trustees have acted for an ulterior motive, in that they are making these applications under
s 29 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance in order to get remuneration for themselves through the costs of these applications.  The allegation is premised on the contention
that there is no viable action that could be brought which could achieve any recovery for the benefit of the creditors.  As I have
stated, this is at best speculative at this stage. In any event, I do not think there is any sufficient basis to raise the inference
sought.  It is unnecessary to deal with the argument whether a trustee’s own fees can be recovered as part of the costs of a contested
application such as this. 30.  For the above reasons, there will be an order for the private examination of the Sisters, subject to the qualification mentioned
in §§7, 17 and 26 above.  The examination is to take place before a master of the High Court.  On a nisi basis, I order that the costs of and relating to the trustees’ summons be paid forthwith by the Sisters to the trustees, to be
taxed if not agreed.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1676.html,"

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. CHENG MEI LING AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1686; HCMP 1825/2016 (21 September 2017),"51.  I have previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Kwan JA in Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 in which the court concluded that if there is not sufficient evidence of constructive notice, it is unnecessary to consider if a
bank has taken reasonable steps to dispel constructive notice. 52.  While Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 was a matter that went to trial, I have also previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Mr Justice Ng in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015, a matter decided on a summary basis, in which His Lordship rejected a defence of undue influence which he found was
based on bare assertions which were not believable, lacked precision or particulars and did not show the defendant has been “…
forced, tricked or misled …” into signing the subject documentation.  As I have observed, every such case is very much dependent on its own facts, but I would
echo what His Lordship said in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015. 53.  After considering all of the evidence and the circumstances, for the reasons set out in my judgment I do not view the evidence of
the 1st defendant that she only entered into the Plaintiff’s Mortgage due to the undue influence of the 5th defendant as believable and therefore giving rise to triable issues which might amount to a credible defence.  Accordingly, I refuse
the application of the 1st defendant that the plaintiff’s Originating Summons be continued as if begun by writ or alternatively that it be heard (wholly or
in part) on oral evidence and therefore I give judgment for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s counsel provided a draft order to the
court for the hearing on 6 July 2017.  I make an order nisi in the terms of the said draft on terms that if any party seeks a variation to the draft they shall apply within 14 days of the date
of handing down of judgment by letter to my clerk setting out the variation they seek.  However, I would encourage the parties to
first seek to agree the terms of a draft order and if agreed jointly submit a draft for approval.","CHENG TUN HUM

costs of Yu and Chow (with certificate of counsel), to be taxed if not agreed and that Yu’s and Chow’s own costs be taxed in
accordance with legal aid taxation. 15.  As regards Royal’s application for costs, although it has been served with the summonses and the skeleton argument of Yu and Chow,
in my view it should be clear to its legal representatives that Royal’s appearance is not in fact necessary.   Moreover, Royal
has received the summonses for about a month before the hearing and there are plenty of opportunities for all the parties concerned
to communicate with each other so as to save time and costs.  In the circumstances, I decline to order any costs either in favour
of or against Royal in relation to Yu’s and Chow’s applications and the hearing of their applications. 16.  As regards the outstanding inter-parte summons taken out by Royal dated 16 April 2017, in the absence of any agreement between the
parties for the time being, I leave it to them to consider, in view of the orders that I have made above, whether the hearing fixed

as stated in the affirmation of Ms Liu filed herein on 24 August 2017. 12.  Variation of costs order nisi and payment of enhanced interest by the plaintiff to the defendant are difficult areas and often attract
heated arguments.  Nonetheless, I had the benefit of agreement reached by the defendant’s solicitors and Director of Legal Aid.
 I found them appropriate in the circumstances of the present case and endorsed the same. 13.  There was no reason why costs should not follow the event.  Director of Legal Aid had agreed that costs of the action, including
the assessment herein be taxed on High Court scale and on indemnity basis, I therefore also made the costs order on the same basis
regarding the present application.  Of course, there could not be any argument that, in so far as applicable, the own costs of the
plaintiff would be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations.","Interest on pre-trial losses:

stopped right across the junction (and not beyond the junction).  This may support that the defendant’s car was not travelling
fast and lend some “objective” weight to the defendant’s case that, on seeing the plaintiff dashing out, he has managed to
stop his car but the plaintiff failed to notice the car and effectively ran a “Stop” sign to collide with the side of the defendant’s
then stationary car. 22.  As such, I do think that the defendant does have a reasonable prospect of a successful defence and, given all the circumstances,
this is a case appropriate for a split trial. 23.  I will give the following orders:","FAN WAI KWONG

of the Injunction Order.  Whether the 1st and 2nd Defendants are persons of low morality or whether they have committed other crimes should not affect their rights to claim for damages
resulting from the wrongful granting of the Injunction Order. 35.  After the hearing, the 1st and 2nd Defendants through their solicitors write to the court indicating they would not proceed with the inquiry for the Default Payment
Claim.  Hence I only make an order for inquiry in respect of the Depreciation in Value Claim and award damages in favour of the 2nd Defendant in the sum of HK$3,508,600.  The parties have not addressed me on the issue of interest and so I reserve my decision on
such matter.  The parties are directed to inform the court within 14 days as to whether the 2nd Defendant is claiming for interest.  After dealing such issue, I will give further directions on the disposal of the Fortification

in time and costs and I should leave the matter to the normal route of taxation if parties cannot agree on costs.  These costs should
be taxable forthwith and the basis for taxation should be “party‑and‑party”. 9.  In the circumstances, I shall make the following orders:",Date of Decision on Costs: 22 September 2017( Jason Pow SC ),Recorder of the High Court,/2017/1822.html,"

BUILDING AUTHORITY v. APPEAL TRIBUNAL (BUILDINGS) [2017] HKCFI 1698; HCAL 11/2014 (25 September 2017),"18.  It is in those special circumstances that the court found it just to make the costs order requiring only the 100th interested to bear the costs of the applicant in the judicial review after he was granted legal aid and actively participated in the proceedings.  There are no similar considerations in the present case. 19.  Second, short of what could be properly regarded as public interest litigation[1] (which is clearly not the case here), the fact that the Church in pursuing the redevelopment plan (which led to the appeal before
the Tribunal and hence the judicial review) is pursing some form of public service and interest alone cannot generally be regarded as a compelling reason to reduce or avoid its costs liability in resisting a successful challenge of an administrative
decision.  Otherwise, almost all public authority respondents in failing to resist a successful judicial review would not be required
to bear the costs or the full costs of the successful applicant in a judicial review, which cannot be right as a matter of general
principle.  See: Ming Pao, supra, paragraph 4. 20.  For all the above reasons, I am not persuaded that I should vary the costs order nisi to the extent as submitted by the Church.  I would therefore dismiss the costs variation application, and the costs order nisi shall hereby become absolute.

In view of the inexcusable substantial delay and the lack of merits of the proposed appeal and despite the absence of prejudice
to the respondent, this is not a proper case for the grant of leave to appeal out of time. 32.  I dismiss the applicant’s summons dated 25 April 2017.  I also make an order nisi for the applicant to pay the respondent’s costs of and occasioned by such summons on a party and party basis to be taxed if not
agreed. ",(Lisa K Y Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1707.html,"

HKSAR v. MCCALL HOWARD KENNETH AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2428; [2018] 3 HKC 61; HCCC 446/2016 (25 September 2017),"43.  The constitutional right at stake in the instant case is the inviolability of a person’s home or other premises.  The issue here
is not simply privacy rights.  I have attempted to outline the importance of that right in earlier passages of this judgment.  It
is a right which is not absolute and an intrusion on such rights which is arbitrary or not lawful should be viewed with seriousness.
 The authorities cited above clearly support the proposition that in granting a search warrant which would render lawful an intrusion
into the rights guaranteed under Article 29 of the Basic Law must take into account that the grant of such a warrant would be such
an intrusion.  The warrantless search formerly permitted under section 52(1)(e) has now been narrowed so as to permit this if, and
only if, the obtaining of a warrant under section 52(1E) is not reasonably practicable.  That too underlines importance that the
legislature accords to the rights of the nature of those guaranteed under Article 29.  The respect due to this right is, in my view,
of the utmost importance.  Nevertheless, in the specific circumstancesof this case it seems to me that the reception into evidence
of the product of the searches of both premises is conducive to a fair trial and most assuredly would not place in jeopardy a fair
trial.  The evidence is both important and cogent and would, for all practical purposes bring to an end the trial of Counts 2 and
3 on the indictment.[23]  Speaking generally and applying the proposition specifically to this set of circumstances, the attempt to fight against the unlawful
trafficking of dangerous drugs is a matter of the highest importance.  In this case, the product of the searches reveals a very serious
case.  Although it is inappropriate at this stage to start looking at the quantum of any sentence that the accused might receive
on conviction for the 2nd and 3rd counts on the indictment and, in particular, the 3rd count, such a sentence would be very substantial and would reflect the serious view that the community of Hong Kong takes with respect
to the unlawful trafficking of substantial quantities of dangerous drugs — particularly of the kind of drugs involved here.  On
any view, this is a serious case.  In my opinion, had I been of the view that the search of the 2 premises had been unlawful and
not justified by section 52(1)(e) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, I would not have hesitated to hold that the breach in the specific circumstances of this case is anything other than reconcilable
withthe respect due to the right or rights concerned. 44. The final issue arising from HKSAR ‍v ‍Muhammad Riaz Khan (above) that needs to be  considered in this context is whether a ‍ruling in favour of the  prosecution appears unlikely to encourage
any future breaches of the rights at issue.  In my ‍judgement, the unique circumstances  of this case, where one ‍arm of the
police (the Mong Kok SDS team) was doing  its job in an ‍apparently perfectly appropriate and professional way[24] and unbeknownst to the Mong Kok SDS team another arm of the police (the Narcotics Bureau) was doing an apparently perfectly appropriate
and professional job in terms of the detection of crime but, as I have held, fell down in relation to how it dealt with search warrants
and unintentionally left the Mong Kok SDS team in a position where the obtaining of a search warrant under section 52(1E) was not reasonably practicable, I think that this alone would demonstrate that such ruling of this Court in the present circumstances
would be unlikely to encourage any future breaches of this kind.  I hasten to add in this context that the officers of the Narcotics
Bureau in not applying for a fresh warrant or applying to renew the existing warrant were not acting in any form of bad faith.  They
simply got the law wrong.  Further, I would be extremely surprised if the law enforcement agencies have not reviewed their practices
in the light of the decision in Keen Lloyd & Ors v Commissioner of Customs and Excise & Department of Justice (above) and there are in place practices and procedures to minimise the risk of future breaches of the rights involved in this case
on the basis of a stale warrant. 45.  For these reasons, I order that the product of the searches of both the Hennessy Road and Canal Road West premises is admissible
against the 1st Accused.  While parties to these proceedings should be permitted to see these reasons for my decision without delay, I think it is
inappropriate and potentially not conducive to a fair trial for there to be any publicity which refers to the degree to which the
police (in this context, I refer to the police as a whole) considered the 1st Accused to be a target for their interest in connection with trafficking in dangerous drugs.  Thus, while I will provide the reasons
for my decision to the parties, I direct that the reasons should not otherwise be published until the conclusion of the trial or
further order.","LAM AROON

JANET ELIZABETH NICHOL v. LEE SIK PO KELVIN [2017] HKCFI 1708; HCA 2254/2013 (26 September 2017),"109.  The parties attended before the Listing Clerk and fixed the substantive hearing of the Summons before Master Hui on 16 May 2017.
Ms Chan and Ms Yu were briefed to appear at such hearing. The hearing bundle was prepared, served and lodged. Skeleton submissions
were also lodged and served by both counsel. When counsel and their instructing solicitors appeared before the learned master on
16 May 2017, both sides were quite ready to proceed with substantive arguments. However, Master Hui took the view it must have been
implicit in the Kwok Order that the hearing of the Summons should be heard by a judge and not a master. I am unable to so read the Kwok Order.
But be that as it may, both Ms Yu and Ms Chan informed this court at the Hearing that they both urged upon Master Hui to hear them
as (a) the learned master had jurisdiction to hear the Summons, (b) they were quite ready to proceed, (c) court hearing time had
been allotted for substantive hearing of the Summons that day and (d) irrespective of any view taken of the Kwok Order both parties
had no objection for the Summons to be heard by a master. Master Hui did not accede to such submissions, and made no order in respect
of the Summons with costs reserved. I do not understand why the learned master did not deal with costs of the hearing before him
since the decision to make no order on the Summons did not turn on the ultimate merits of the Summons and was a matter privy to him
rather than the eventual tribunal for the substantive hearing of the Summons. 110.  Indeed, D tried to ameliorate the consequences of the Hui Order by having his solicitors write to P’s solicitors on 19 May 2017
proposing “in light of the observations made by Master during the hearing that implied in paragraph 4 of [the Kwok Order] is a
direction that the hearing be fixed before Judge and not Master” to file a consent summons for the Summons to be heard before a
master.  But no doubt as a matter of prudence arising from Master Hui’s observations that instilled concern over the implied effect of the Kwok Order (although I do not read such order that way), P’s solicitors replied on 23 May 2017 that it would be better
to re-fix the hearing before a judge as soon as possible. 111.  Thus, the consequence of the Hui Order was that costs incurred by both parties for the hearing on 16 May 2016 were wasted, and the
hearing of the Summons was deferred for 3½ months until the Hearing on 30 August 2017. By the time the Summons came before this
court, there was, of course, no help for it (as both Ms Yu and Ms Chan recognised and accepted) but to grant the cost order in paragraph
103(d) above. Given the pragmatic, efficiency-oriented and cost-saving CJR culture which should have prevailed by now, it is, however,
a sad waste of time, cost and effort to adjourn when the parties were ready to and indeed wished to proceed, and when the tribunal
had hearing time and jurisdiction, and if there was any concern (which I disagree) all that was needed was an order by consent for
the Summons to be heard by the master (which again would be a matter within the jurisdiction of the master).","LEE SIK PO KELVIN

of junior counsel.  I bear in mind the complexity of the case, especially in terms of the contrasting factual versions relied on
by the parties, as well as the value of the convertible bond and the importance of the case to the 1st Defendant.  The absolute figure claimed is, in my experience, not unreasonable even though it was exclusive of further drafting or
settling of documents, consultations and conferences.  I will stick to my original ruling. 61.  I have only revised my ruling in respect of items 32, 46, 70.1-70.7 and 76 of Section A.  The net result is to deduct a further
8.25 hours from the time costs of Mr Tse, at the rate of $4,300/hour. 62.  Both sides have succeeded partly in their applications for review.  Although there have been revisions in respect of the costs allowed
for the aforesaid four sets of items, the change in the overall position is not substantial when compared to the size of the Bill.

LEE YAN YAN ANKA v. THE PUN U DISTRICT ASSOCIATION OF HONG KONG [2017] HKCFI 1714; HCA 2516/2016 (26 September 2017),"23.  Mr Yip makes the point that the Plaintiff has no locus standi to appear at this hearing.  He submits that the Plaintiff, being a member of the Defendant, has no right to take part in the usual
business of the Defendant or to handle its tenancy matters, and is in no position to consent or to object to the application.  He
further submits that as there is no counterclaim by the Defendant against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff should not have been made
a party to the application. 24.  Mr Yip is right that the Plaintiff may not take part in the usual business of the Defendant, cannot handle its tenancy matters,
cannot cause Bank of China to allow the Defendant to operate its account and cannot cause the tenants to acknowledge the new Executive
Committee’s authority to bind the Defendant.  But be that as it may, she is a proper party in this application. She challenged
the validity of the election and sought to revoke the appointment of the new Executive Committee.  The order which the Defendant
sought has the opposite effect of requiring Bank of China and the three tenants to acknowledge the authority of the new Executive
Committee in representing the Defendant, albeit for a very limited scope.  She must be informed of the application and the possibility
that such an order would be made so that she may voice her opinion.  She may contest or consent to the application, if she has a
view one way or the other.  She may remain neutral with or without making any submission on the law or on the fact to assist the
court.  She may also let the application go by default to save costs.  She is a proper party and has locus standi to appear. 25.  For the above reasons, I grant the order sought under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Defendant’s amended summons and order that

LAERDAL MEDICAL LTD v. HONG KONG HAOCHENG INTERNATIONAL TRADE LTD [2017] HKCFI 1742; HCA 2193/2016 (26 September 2017),"9.  Apart from the prospect of success of the proposed appeal, I also have regard to the circumstances of the present case.  The real
dispute is about the money still remaining in D’s bank account.  Apart from that money, D does not have other assets in Hong Kong
to satisfy the Judgment.  I am told that D’s bank account has in effect been “frozen” by the Police by means of a “letter
of no consent” which is purely an administrative measure.The reality is that if that letter is not withdrawn, then even if a stay
of execution was ordered, D would be unlikely to be able to move any money out of that bank account.  On the other hand, if the Police
was minded to withdraw the “letter of no intent”, there would be nothing to prevent P from taking out a post-judgment Mareva injunction in order to preserve the assets.  Besides, in my assessment there is not a risk that D’s appeal would be rendered nugatory
if no stay was ordered.  This is because P’s solicitors have agreed to stake-hold all money derived from the execution of the Judgment
against D pending the disposal of the appeal.  Moreover, a business associate of P in Hong Kong has also offered to give an undertaking
to court that it will repay D in the event of a successful appeal.  There is no reason for me to doubt the sufficiency and adequacy
of the aforesaid undertakings.  On the other hand, D does not have substantial ties with Hong Kong and if it was allowed to remove
any money out of its bank account, the likelihood of P being able to execute its Judgment in case D’s appeal failed would be remote. 10.  In all the circumstances, given the undertakings from P, I see no good reasons why P should not have the fruits of its Judgment
now.  Therefore, I refuse D’s application for stay of execution.  11.  I will hear counsel on costs.",Date of Judgment: 26 September 2017(Alex Lee),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1742.html,"

will.  On the other hand, they have not given their consent either.  There is therefore a necessity to have a hearing on those issues.
 D1 in effect objects to the passing over, although he says in court that he does not object to the appointment of independent person
as administrator to administer the Deceased estate together with him.  D2 and D3 support the plaintiff’s application for passing
over.  The issue of passing over occupied much of the court’s time spent.  Having regards to the issues in dispute, the respective

With regard to contempt of court, neither counsel developed submissions on the point.  Moreover, I consider such a serious allegation
is one in respect of which the parties should have the opportunity to provide evidence.  There was no such opportunity.  For these
reasons, I decline to make an order for indemnity costs. 21.  With regard to the submission that the defendant is making oppressive, frivolous and vexatious applications, I do not think the
defendant’s conduct can be characterized as such at this stage.  The defendant’s appeal against the Master’s orders succeeded.
 Applications for costs to be taxed and paid forthwith are quite commonplace and the result is a matter for a court’s discretion.
 With regard to the defendant’s particular applications, the manner in which they were conducted was not oppressive and they were

affirmations of service is the Defendant’s registered address.  The Plaintiff’s solicitors duly confirmed the same through Mr

said, I required the Plaintiff’s solicitors to undertake to file a further affirmation within 2 days to exhibit such record(s)
filed in the Companies Registry verifying the Defendant’s registered address. 22.  Upon the Plaintiff’s solicitors giving the said undertaking, and also upon my being satisfied that the Provisional Agreement is

the suspended sentence, the Appellant committed further offences in relation to false trade mark and unlawful employment. 40.  I can find no flaw in the Magistrate’s decision of activating the suspended sentence and activating it in full.  It is not unjust
to order the present sentence to run wholly consecutively to the fully activated suspended sentence. 41.  The total sentence which the Appellant faces as a result is 24 months and 2 weeks for the two cases.  In my judgment, it is neither

"CHUNG TIN PUI, AS MANAGER OF CHUNG MAN YIU TSO v. LI PAK SAU AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1735; HCA 568/2007 (29 September 2017)","62.  With regard to Mr Koo’s last point of limitation, I have doubt whether s. 4 of the Limitation Ordinance can apply to a claim for retransfer of land based on resulting trust.  In any case, the claim does not arise unless and until the
plaintiff has withdrawn from the illegal agreements.  I cannot see how the plaintiff can maintain his involvement in the illegality
and at the same time seek retransfer of the property in question.  Hence, the cause of action only arose upon withdrawal from the
agreements.  This ground of objection thus has no merit. 63.  Though Mr Koo has not raised this question, I would also advert to it.  This action was started in 2007.  But 2nd defendant’s listing questionnaire filed on 10 February 2017 still said that it was not appropriate to set the case down for trial.
 Furthermore, the development cannot proceed further because the District Lands Office will not issue any more building licence for
the lots as a result of the plaintiff’s complaint.  The situation is thus in a deadlock.  There is no pressing need for the actin
to be disposed of.  I have also observed that the new cause of action based on illegality may assume core importance in this action.
 Hence, delay is not a factor against the granting leave to re-amend the statement of claim. 64.  I will grant leave to the plaintiff to effect the proposed re-amendments with consequential directions and costs order.  However,
I would give the plaintiff one more opportunity to consider and advise me no later than 6 October 2017 on whether he would have further
revisions to make to the draft re-amendments to take into account of the development of the law in Patel v Mirza and if so, when the revisions will be ready.",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1735.html,"

LEE WAI KEI WICKY v. WORLD FAMILY LTD [2017] HKCFI 1743; HCLA 35/2015 (3 October 2017),"54.  The complaint relating to the inherent improbability of the Defendant’s case is not pursued by Mr Kwok in the appeal, and rightly
so.  There is nothing inherent in the Defendant’s case, and there is no basis for the court to disturb the primary findings of
fact made by the Presiding Officer. 55.  Finally, Mr Kwok also raises a procedural challenge in respect of the evidence given by Madam Tsui of the Defendant.  He refers
to an incident that occurred during the trial on 9 July 2015.  According to Mr Kwok, the Presiding Officer should have disallowed
part of Ms Tsui evidence because a trainee solicitor hired by the Defendant was feeding the answers to her.  However, the Presiding
Officer had dealt with such complaint in the Decision.  She had already rejected Madam Tsui’s evidence given in the morning of
9 July 2015 and accorded very little weight to the rest of her evidence.[25]  Hence, such procedural challenge simply has no merit at all. 56.  For the above reasons, the Presiding Officer was entitled to make the finding that the Claimant was not working as an employee of
the Defendant.  I therefore dismiss the appeal.  I also make a costs order nisi that: (i) the costs of the appeal be to the Defendant; and (ii) the Claimant’s own costs to be taxed in accordance with legal aid

SZETO YUK LIN v. KANTON LTD AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1751; HCMP 251/2016 (6 October 2017),"5.  In my view, the costs for D6’s application for extension of time should be higher than usual.  This is because D6’s summons
was heard on the very same date as the Writ Procedure Summons, so that it was reasonable for P to engage the same counsel to deal
with both applications, rather than to engage a solicitor just for D6’s summons.  Moreover, as D6’s counsel had prepared a written
skeleton for its application for extension of time, it was only reasonable for P’s counsel to also prepare a written submission
in reply so as to better assist the court.  Moreover, costs would also need to be incurred to peruse the affirmation which D6 sought
to adduce.  6.  However, the application for extension under consideration was a relative straight forward one and the time spent on its hearing
was brief.  I can see no justifications whatsoever for P to engage two counsel for the hearing of D6’s summons and none has been
given.  Moreover, it is apparent that there was some degree of overlap of work in dealing with D6’s application for extension and
the application for the writ procedure.  Based on the aforesaid, the counsel fees that P attributed to D6’s application for extension
are in my view both unreasonable and excessive.  Moreover, the total time spent by P’s solicitor (namely, 4 hours and 10 minutes)
is in my view also excessive for an application of this nature. 7.  Having adopted a board brush approach, I would only allow P a global sum of $15,000 for the application and hearing of D6’s summons
for extension.","THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF PAK FAI MANSION

何妙鸞 v. 鄺譪慧 AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1754; HCA 2367/2015 (6 October 2017),"47.  Many of the exhibits filed by the Plaintiff in her affirmation in opposition to the Defendants’ application to striking out are
directed at these disputes.  While the Plaintiff’s performance is a material issue in dispute, the crucial element of the Plaintiff’s
case against the 4th Defendant remains unclear.  There is no indication of the material facts relied on by the Plaintiff in support of her allegation
that the 4th Defendant identified her as being mentally ill and handicapped; discriminated her; subjected her to prejudicial, unfair and unjust
treatment.  It is impossible for the 4th Defendant to know what the Plaintiff’s case against her was.  Her pleading as against the 4th Defendant should also be struck out as frivolous or vexatious and otherwise abuse of the process of the court and her action be dismissed. 48. Section 72 of the Disability Discrimination Ordinance gives exclusive jurisdiction to the District Court over such claims for disability discrimination in the employment context.  Thus,
to the extent that the Plaintiff’s claim is founded on disability discrimination, such claim must be dismissed as this court has
no jurisdiction.  In addition, as regards those claims arising from events occurring in 2011 to 2012 concerning the 1st to 3rd Defendants, they are statute-barred under section 82 of that Ordinance which provides for a limitation period of 24 months. 49.  For the above reasons, the Plaintiff’s re-amended statement of claim must be struck out as frivolous or vexatious and otherwise
abuse of the process of the court as against the 1st, 3rd and 4th Defendants; and as disclosing no reasonable cause of action as against the 2nd Defendant.  Accordingly, I uphold the master’s decision and dismiss the Plaintiff’s appeal with costs to the Defendants.","何惠珠

On 23 February 2016, Master Leong ordered the plaintiff to pay further security for costs into court to cover the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants’ costs, and also the 4th defendant’s costs, up to the determination of the issue of split trial. As matters progressed, the assessment of the security for
costs fell to me. The learned master had previously ordered the plaintiff to pay security for costs to cover the defendants’ costs
up to the exchange of witness statements and which had been paid by the plaintiff into court. This is my assessment of the quantum
of the security that ought to be provided to cover these further costs up to the determination of the issue of split trial. 2.  I deal first with 4th defendants’ claim for security for costs and do so by utilising the helpful table prepared by the 4th defendant’s solicitors.  I shall then deal with the 1st, 2nd and 5th defendants’ claim for security for costs and also do so by utilising the helpful table prepared by their solicitors. 3.

HKSAR v. BULLEN CHRISTIAN ANTHONY [2017] HKCFI 1755; HCMA 50/2017 (9 October 2017),"19.  All these factors, and the inference that can be drawn are factors that this court should into account when considering the exercise
of the discretionary power in awarding costs or not.  As held by the Court of Final Appeal in Ting James Henry (cited above): 20.  In my view, the refusal of costs can be justified, not so much on the grounds of acquittal because of technicality, but on the basis
that the Appellant in fact brought suspicion on himself, thereby bringing the Appellant within the exceptions to the general rule
regarding the award of costs to an acquitted defendant. 21.  In these circumstances, the appeal against the refusal order made by the Magistrate is dismissed.  There is no costs order in these
proceedings.","14 March 2017

HKSAR v. OSINAGA BANEGAS MARIA ISABEL [2017] HKCFI 1757; HCCC 219/2017 (9 October 2017),"27.  It seems to me that a defendant’s participation in the campaign is a reflection of his genuine remorse for the crime that he has
committed and desire to assist the authorities to prevent others from making the same mistake.  It is the display of remorse and
cooperativeness with the authorities that a sentencing court can recognise within its sentencing discretion.  To this end, it needs
to be established on evidence that the defendant has genuinely participated in the campaign, and that the participation has been
positive and substantial.  28.  As I have already indicated, the narcotic content of cocaine in the present case warrants a starting point of 24 years’ imprisonment.
There is an international element involved in this offence because the defendant was importing drugs into Hong Kong.  The sentencing
guidelines provide that an international element is an aggravating factor calling for the enhancement of the starting point where
for amounts above 1 kg should not be less than 2 years’ imprisonment.  Accordingly, the starting point is enhanced by 2 years to
26 years’ imprisonment.  As I have stated I will reduce her sentence by 9 months for her genuine, and positive and substantial
participation in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign which will result in a starting point of 25 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.
 29.  As the defendant is entitled to a one third discount for her plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, the defendant is therefore
sentenced to 16 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1757.html,"

BANK OF BARODA v. PSONS LTD (FORMERLY KNOWN AS PSON LTD AND PSONS LTD) [2017] HKCFI 1862; HCCW 162/2016 (9 October 2017),"4.  During the morning of 6 October, Glencore served its skeleton submissions, and it will be seen that it complained that no reasons
supporting the application had been made by the contributories in support of the summons, putting it in a difficult position.  Glencore
made it clear that it would be seeking indemnity costs. 5.  The court has already outlined the chronology. This is a case where I take the view that indemnity costs should be awarded to Glencore.
 When a company has been wound up, a summons to rescind that winding-up order must be supported by very strong grounds.  The requirements
are well-known and not in dispute.  But here, there is simply nothing filed in support of the summons.  There was merely a passing
reference in the correspondence to the fact that the court would be requested to read certain lengthy accountancy documents.  6.  I take the view that the attitude taken in pursuit of the summons verges on an abuse of process.  The summons should not have been
taken out in the first place.  At best, the contributories were optimistic at that time that good reason would come into existence.  In those circumstances, I see no reason why indemnity costs should not be awarded to Glencore. ",Date of Judgment: 9 October 2017(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1862.html,"

to ground” as he has in the past.  This is due to the prosecution policy of placing his case in abeyance pending the outcome of
his non-refoulement claim and the length of time that it takes the authorities to process the claim.  I am informed that a screening
interview for his non-refoulement claim has yet to be arranged for various reasons but it means that the claim could be outstanding
and unresolved for some time.  Even if I was to direct that the relevant authorities expedite the process of his claim, it still
remains that an unfavourable decision could be the subject of appeal or other action, and the prosecution policy is that the case
is placed in abeyance until all appeal procedures have been concluded.  Such is the unsatisfactory and paradoxical situation that
the courts have to unravel in order to properly decide bail applications of this type.  30.  There is a catch to all of this, which is that if the decision of the non-refoulement claim is favourable, the prosecution policy
dictates that the immigration offence would not be proceeded with.  This would result in the applicant’s immediate release from
custody even taking into account the time served for any penalty on Charge 2.  It is for this reason that I have made some assessment
of the overall history and circumstances of the present case as well as taking into account the past rejection for asylum and torture
protection in order to arrive at my decision on the question of bail.  31.  In the circumstances of this case, there is a real risk that the applicant would fail to surrender to custody as the court may appoint,
notwithstanding the imposition of conditions on bail.  I will therefore refuse bail at this stage.  However, if the applicant is
still in custody, he is at liberty to bring on an application for bail before me in two months’ time which should coincide approximately
with the applicant having served the likely sentence that would be imposed upon him in relation to the two charges. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1759.html,"

HKSAR v. IKA PUTRI PRAPTANINGRUM [2017] HKCFI 1766; HCCC 135/2017 (11 October 2017),"17.  I do not find on a balance of probabilities, that the applicant entered her plea of guilty on 18 April 2017 involuntarily as a result
of suffering from duress or lack of freedom of choice in that she believed if she did not do so then some harm would befall her son
at the hands of Supriadi or his associates. 18.  It is more likely that the applicant was motivated in her plea by the offer of continued financial support to her family which she
accepted continued throughout her remand in custody.  I find this to be the case because the opportunity for financial support for
her family was something that had prompted her continued relationship over a number of years with a man whom she said regularly abused
her.  There can be no other reason why she would have remained with him if what she said was true.  The hope of financial support
does not amount to undue pressure in the circumstances of this case because the child was already being looked after by his father’s
family.  There is no evidence before me that he was not being well cared for in all respects.  The applicant simply wanted more financial
security.  She clearly understood what it was she was doing when she entered her plea of guilty and was motivated by the desire to
obtain the maximum discount off her sentence as she readily admitted in evidence.  Her change of heart and desire to withdraw her
plea comes about because she realises she has been used by Supriadi, something she did entirely voluntarily. 19.  Accordingly I will not allow her to withdraw her plea of guilty entered on 18 April 2017 before the Eastern Magistrates’ Court
and this matter will be listed for sentence on 19 October 2017.",(A P Campbell‑Moffat)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1766.html,"

HAU SING TSO AND OTHERS v. SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE [2017] HKCFI 1786; HCMP 1431/2014 (11 October 2017),"30.  Mr Wong argued that the Secretary for Home Affairs had elected not to join any other parties and is bound by his election. He relied
on the follow facts as exercise of the election.  Shortly after the issue of the Plaintiffs Summons, on 9 July 2014 the Secretary
for Justice wrote issued the Plaintiffs’ solicitors inviting them to join the objectors and threatening that he would do so if
the Plaintiffs did not and would claim costs against them.  He submitted that clearly there was a choice to take out the joinder
application at that stage or to go ahead with the originating summons proceedings without joining the objectors.  He argued that
the Secretary for Justice had taken an active role in not only consenting to extension of time for the Plaintiffs to file their affirmations
out of time, but also filed an additional affirmation to secure the position of having the “last word” to the proceedings.  The
delay in taking out the joinder application at this stage when all affirmations have been filed created procedural complications.
 He therefore argued that by filing two affirmations dated 1 September 2014 and 9 September 2016, the Secretary for Justice has exercised
the election. 31.  As early as 9 July 2014, the Secretary for Justice had intimated that he would take out a joinder application if the Plaintiffs
did not.  He never resiled from that position.  He even renewed the threat in March 2016.  It was not until August 2016 that the
Plaintiffs finalised their case and sought leave to file another affirmation.  The Secretary for Justice acted reasonably by consenting
to the request except to ask for leave to file a reply affirmation to deal with any new matters raised by the Plaintiffs.  I am unable
to see how the filing of affirmation by the Defendant could be taken as exercise of the election to abandon the joinder application.
 Though all affirmations had been filed, directions for setting the Plaintiffs’ Summons down for argument has not been given until
4 November 2016.  But a week before that, the Secretary for Justice had made the joinder application.  There is no prejudice caused
by the joinder application.  If any election has been made, it was an election to proceed with the joinder application.  Interest
of justice requires that the application be allowed. 32.  I am satisfied that application meets the requirements for joinder prescribed by Order 15, rule 6.  Accordingly, I allow the Defendant’s application with costs.","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

letter dated 11 August 2017 and provide a more complete picture to the court for determining the issue of waiver. 9.

is that the debts under both the first part and the second part of proviso (i) are deductible.  There is nothing to indicate that
debts which were included as trading receipts in ascertaining the profits must also, in the case of a money lender, have been lent

make a deduction where, as in this case, interest income not actually received had been taxed on an accrual basis when it can be
shown that such interest was unlikely actually to be received, merely because the loan was not lent in the ordinary course of the
business of the lending of money.  36.  Ground 12, like Ground 1, is no more than a general assertion, questioning the ultimate conclusion of the Board without identifying

DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD v. TIAN WEN QUAN [2017] HKCFI 1810; HCA 3228/2016 (12 October 2017),"43.  I am grateful to counsel for their assistance. 44.  After a finalised draft of this decision was prepared, further submissions were received from the Bank by way of a letter from its
solicitors dated 20 September 2017.  Such action was strongly rebuked by Tian’s solicitors as improper.  I agree with Tian that
there was no or no adequate justification to take the unusual course of making uninvited submissions to the court after the conclusion
of a hearing (see To Pui Kui v Ng Kwok Piu, CACV 281/2012, 21 August 2014, §§56-58). 45.  In any case, I see no reason to change my mind on the determination of this application.  However, as a result of the additional
submissions, the handing down of this decision has unfortunately been delayed. ",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1810.html,"

C v. S [2017] HKCFI 1968; HCMP 929/2017 (12 October 2017),"99.  In the present case, similarly, and as I have said earlier, giving the Father all the Rights under s3 (1)(d) of GMO would not give
him any power to override the decision of the Mother who holds sole custodian rights, and that he will only have a right to be consulted
on matters of consequence that relates to the Child’s upbringing, plus all others of the Rights. 100.  I order that the Father shall have all of the rights and authority that the law would allow him as father if the Child were legitimate. 101.  As for costs in children cases, there is generally no order as to costs unless one party has been unreasonable in the litigation.
 In my view, the Mother has opposed this application unreasonably.  She regarded the application as a custody application and was
contradictory as she conceded that the Father does have a right to be consulted over major matters concerning the Child.  She was
unable to say what rights the Father should not have.  The Father obviously does not fall into that category of fathers who had played
no part in the Child’s life.  Having considered her grounds of opposition, in my view, the Mother should bear the costs of this
application.  I am aware that the Mother is under legal aid, but that does not entitle her to oppose an application unreasonably.
 I therefore order that the Father’s costs of this application be paid by the Mother, to be taxed and paid forthwith. The Mother’s
own costs be taxed under legal aid regulations.  This is an order nisi, to be made absolute after 21 days.",(Bebe Pui Ying Chu)Judge for the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1968.html,"

HK$60,000), one wonders why he has not taken the same care in recording his loss of earnings (amounting to almost HK$0.9M) by, say,
keeping the “referral arrangement” accounts. This simply adds weight to my finding that there was no substantial “referral
arrangement”. 85.  There be interest on general damages at 2% from date of writ to the date of judgment and interest on special damages at half judgment
rate from the date of accident to date of judgment. 86.  I would also give an order nisi for the costs of the action to be paid by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants to the plaintiff to be taxed if not agreed in the District Court scale and the plaintiff’s own costs be taxed in accordance

I have to say, in fairness to the 3rd Defendant, that I understand that the orders have not been served on it. 3.  The evidence before the court is quite disturbing. It appears that there is a concerted effort by various parties to try to hide
from the court, and thereby frustrating the disclosure orders, as to the whereabouts of the LaFerrari.  With respect, the alleged
sale or re-sale of the LaFerrari is, on the available evidence, difficult to believe due to, inter alia, the vast undervalue at which
it was purportedly sold and re-sold.  There is clearly urgency in the matter, which was accepted by DHCJ Keith and DHCJ Francis.
The urgency remains.  In particular, the property has still not been located and the orders which were made by the court have been
frustrated.   4.  In these circumstances, there is justification for making a further disclosure order as requested by the Plaintiff.  Hence, I have
made the order pursuant to the Summons before me dated 10 October 2017 with amendments.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 13 October 2017(Anthony Chan),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2277.html,"

 In this regard, I agree with Mr Wong’s submission that the Plaintiff should not have issued the Summons since the Plaintiff had
been duly put on notice of the Defendant’s case by way of pre‑action letters[4] as well as by its pleadings filed in this action. 57.  Accordingly, it was ordered by me at the hearing that the Plaintiff’s Summons be dismissed, and the Plaintiff do pay the Defendant’s

SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LTD v. ARJOWIGGINS HKK 2 LTD [2017] HKCFI 1918; HCMP 3060/2016 (17 October 2017),"3.  It is not necessary for me to explain in any detail the possible application and qualifications to the approach described by Ribeiro
PJ because it seems to me that there is a simpler justification for changing the costs order.  4.  As is apparent from my reasons, a very significant part of the argument before me and the time spent in court, namely, three days,
arose from various arguments advanced by the defendant which I thought were misconceived and in some instances clearly so.  Ms Cheng
whilst reminding me of the principles explained in cases like Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2) [2] has not invited me to apportion the costs.  But it does seem to me that as any costs order largely goes to financial matters and
the financial impact of litigation, the way in which the hearing developed and the matters attributable to the length of this hearing
and the preparation required for it are relevant in determining whether or not costs should be ordered on an indemnity basis or the
more conventional party-and-party basis.  On balance it seems to me that in the circumstances whatever concerns I may harbour about
the approach of the plaintiff to this matter, the appropriate order, I am satisfied, is that the defendant’s costs should be paid
by the plaintiff with a certificate for two counsel and assessed on a party-and-party basis. 5.  So far as the costs of this summons are concerned, Ms Cheng has unsurprisingly asked for an order that the defendant pay the costs
with a certificate for one counsel.  It does, however, seem to me that as the costs order nisi was my initiative and therefore an application to vary it had to be made in any event, and also having regard to the broad approach
that I have suggested earlier in this decision is appropriate when determining costs in this particular case, I will make no order
as to the costs of the summons dated 18 July 2017.",Date of Decision: 17 October 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/1918.html,"

As to the garnishee proceedings, I consider that if the 9th defendant had acted without delay, the garnishee proceedings would not have been launched by the plaintiff.  Hence, mindful the garnishee

judgment upon US$350,000 being paid into court by the 9th defendant), I make an order nisi that upon such discharge there be no order as to costs in respect of the garnishee proceedings as between the plaintiff and the 9th defendant. 52.

action against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents do stand dismissed without further order with costs of and occasioned by these proceedings to be paid by the Petitioner
to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents”. Again, it must be remembered that these are winding up proceedings, and it is inappropriate for a petition to be
dismissed without order of the court. Should Chen fail to pay the prescribed security within the prescribed time, it would be for
Ng/Daughter to take appropriate action as they see fit in relation to the disposal of the present proceedings. But it would be inappropriate
for this court to order dismissal of the present proceedings without further order. 123.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event.

to be as follows: 20.  The appellant is to serve 22 months in total for the five charges which he faced under TMCC 2032.  The period of custody or detention
to be deducted from that sentence is to be 40 days representing 25 and 26 July 2016 and 26 November 2016 to 2 January 2017 as confirmed
by the Correctional Services Department.  All other periods of detention or custody have been credited elsewhere. 21.  The appellant has not been prejudiced by the fact that he was sentenced separately under STCC 5298 and TMCC 2032 and all relevant
periods of custody or detention have been taken into account.  Accordingly, this appeal against sentence is dismissed.",(A P Campbell Moffat)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1865.html,"

is excepted from the definition of “meeting” in section 2(1) as being a “gathering or assembly of persons convened or organized exclusively … as a conference or seminar bona fide intended
for the discussion of topics of a … professional, business … character.”  Had it been necessary to do so, I would have considered
it reasonably arguable that this exception does not, or may not, apply to the Special Meeting having regard to the purpose of the
meeting, the identity of the persons being invited to attend the meeting, the matters discussed at the meeting, the conduct of the
participants at the meeting, as well as the resolution passed at the meeting. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, the applications for leave to amend or re-amend the Form 86, as well as the application for leave to
apply for judicial review, are dismissed. Where an application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed on the ground
that the applicant has no standing to make the application, it may properly be regarded as an abuse of the court’s process.  Taking
into account also the lack of merits in the proposed challenge and the substantial assistance that the court has received from the
putative respondents (including the evidence filed on their behalf), I consider that the putative respondents ought to be entitled
to the costs of resisting the various applications (including costs previously reserved), to be taxed if not agreed with certificate
for one counsel.  I so order. 41.  Lastly, it remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance rendered to the court.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1852.html,"

materials normally put before it by those who have been appointed to administer the estate and who ought to be in a good position
to provide such information and materials.  In the present case, I consider the plaintiffs have wholly failed to make any real attempt
to justify the estimated costs or potential liabilities of the estate of the Deceased.  The plaintiffs’ estimated total figure
of around HK$125 million, as well as the individual estimated sums, are, in my view, unreliable.  Distribution of the estate of the
Deceased is long overdue, being in mind that the Deceased passed away more than 13 years ago and probate was granted to the Executrices
more than 11 years ago.  Doing the best that I can on the information and materials before me and taking a broad view of the situation,
I consider that a reserve of HK$50 million should be ample to provide for the potential costs and liabilities of the estate in respect
of the items referred by Mr Wong.  Taking into account also Mr Leung’s submission that the cash in the RMB account may not be readily
realizable, I consider that an interim distribution of HK$88 million ought to be made to the beneficiaries of the estate of the Deceased. 13.  For the foregoing reasons, I direct the Executrices to make a further interim distribution of HK$88 million to the beneficiaries
of the estate of the Deceased. 14.  I reserve the question of costs, which shall be dealt with at the hearing of the rest of the claim and counterclaim in this action.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1864.html,"

There are also disputes about the amount remitted into the BEA Accounts by Kal and the amount transferred by Lau out of those accounts
to his own account with Chong Hing Bank and Deutsche Bank.  For the same reason, these disputes have no bearing in view of Lau’s
admission in the Repayment Agreement that he owed Kal US$24,800,000.  The amount admitted must have taken into account all sums remitted
into the BEA Accounts, all sums transferred out of those accounts and all payments made by Lau to Kal.  These disputes could not
raise any triable issue.  Besides, Lau is the holder and signatory of these accounts.  He did not even plead or adduce evidence of
the correct amount according to these accounts.  He merely put the Plaintiff to strict proof and dressed up the dispute as a triable
issue.  His disputes about these amounts are not made bona fide and raised no triable issue at all.  54.  There are other issues which Mr Chan argued were triable.  I have considered them but do not find it necessary to specifically deal
with them.  They are frivolous and have no bearing on the Plaintiff’s application for summary judgment. 55.  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that this is a case suitable for summary judgment.  I am also satisfied that the Defendant
has not shown any credible defence or raised any triable issue.  Accordingly, I enter judgment for the Plaintiff in the amount of
US$24,180,000 with interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the rate of 1% per month from 27 July 2012 under the date of issue

better accommodation and/or a care regiment to be implemented, I shall make an order in the usual terms, including the provision
for periodical payments, and then I may consider adjourning the hearing before me to a later date to deal with the provision of better
accommodation and/or the implementation of a care regime.  Future applications thereafter can be made to the Mental Health Court
either to form a Committee, if so required, or if a Committee has already been formed, to deal with other matters. 55.  It is usual for the agreed costs to include the costs of forming a Committee[10].  In special cases where it may be appropriate for the PI Judge to assist in the provision of better accommodation or the implementation
of a care regime, provision should also be made for payment by the defendant of the cost of the additional hearing before the PI
Judge for this purpose.  Such costs can be kept to a minimum if proper quotations are provided in advance. The matter might even
be dealt with on paper. 56.  It is my sincere hope that any legal aid certificate in place would not be discharged until such further necessary applications
have been made.  These cases involve vulnerable persons who do not possess the ability to take care of these matters, securing suitable
accommodation or implementing a care regime, by themselves.  Equally, I would expect solicitors, acting for a mentally incapacitated
plaintiff who is not legally aided, to continue to assist the next friend or the Committee, if one has previously been appointed,
to make these further necessary applications.  In all cases, whether legally aided or not, the next friend or the Committee ought

HUI SHUI KAY v. HON TO AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1892; HCMP 3399/2016 (26 October 2017),"38.  By their conduct, the estate was deprived of $45,000 and has to bear costs of this case.  The trustees also failed to assist the
court in furthering 5 underlying objectives under Order 1A, rule 1(a) to (e), ie to increase the cost-effectiveness of practice and
procedure, to ensure that a case is dealt with as expeditiously as is reasonably practicable, to promote a sense of reasonable proportion
and procedural economy, to ensure fairness between the parties and to facilitate the settlement of disputes.  The plaintiff, the
estate and the court are prejudiced from such conduct. 39.  For all these reasons, the plaintiff should have costs on indemnity basis, which I summarily assess at $200,000, having considered
the grounds of objection.  Such costs should be borne out of the estate in the first instance.  The 1st defendant has not contested the claim and no order for costs should be made against her personally.  I make orders nisi accordingly. 40.

HU YAN AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1898; [2017] 5 HKLRD 768; HCA 2401/2015 (26 October 2017)","43.  As for Mr Chan SC’s argument based on the use of the word “misappropriated” in paragraph 8 of the statement of claim, I think
he was quoting the word out of context.  I have mentioned in paragraph 28 above that the word “misappropriated” as used in the
statement of claim is not to be understood in its technical sense.  It merely referred to the act or omission of not handing over
the Sum pursuant to their duty as director or employee of the Company.  The Plaintiff’s cause of action is conversion, which is
a tort of strict liability.  The intention of the defendant in relation to the claimant is of no significance. The claimant does
not have to prove dishonesty.  The defendant’s honest and reasonable belief that he was entitled to exercise possessory right over
the subject matter of conversion is also irrelevant.  Given this context in which the word was used, it is impossible to infer any
allegation of fraud or dishonesty.  As was held by the Court of Appeal in Menfond Electronic Art & Computer & Design Co Ltd v Wong Wang Tat Victor [26], the court should not infer the making of an allegation of deliberate dishonesty too liberally, it should not put a spin of deliberate
dishonesty on an alleged act or omission simply because the plaintiff said it was wrongful on his version of event.  What Mr Chan
SC was seeking to do was to put that spin of deliberate dishonesty on the word “misappropriated” by quoting it out of context.
 This is just a simple case, involving simple facts which left no room for any argument of the “fraud exception”. 44.  Mr Hughes suggested seeking the court’s indulgence to amend the statement of claim by deleting the word “misappropriated”.
 I do not consider that necessary.  The meaning of that word in its proper context is so clear that it is incapable of being misunderstood. 45.  For the above reasons, I find that the Plaintiff have made out a prima facie case that they are entitled to judgment, and that the Defendants have failed to show any bona fide defence or raise any triable issue.  Though some of the Contracts had been performed by the Company paying Zhou about 58% of the
amount due, the entire Sum was shown to have been converted.  While there is no doubt that the Company performed some of those Contracts
using its own funds, it does not necessary mean those funds came from part of the Sum.  It would have been appropriate to enter judgment
for the entire Sum.  However, I would err in favour of the Defendants and adopt the same generous course taken by the master, ie
to enter summary judgment to the extent of the outstanding amount of the Sum which the Company had failed to pay Zhou and to give
unconditional leave to defend the balance.  I therefore uphold the master’s decision and dismiss the appeal with costs.",Date of Decision: 26 October 2017( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1898.html,"

YAU KA HANG v. COMPANIES REGISTRY [2017] HKCFI 2076; HCMP 1819/2017 (26 October 2017),"4.  I think that in this kind of case one has to take a robust commonsense view.  Mr Yau clearly appears to this court to have an interest
in the matter.  Without going into the details of the Road Traffic Ordinance, it is clear to me that without a restoration order, Mr Yau will not be able to get the car registered in his name because the transfer
of ownership took place on a date after the dissolution of the company. 5.  If a restoration order is given, by virtue of s 768(1) the company is to be regarded as having continued in existence as if it had
not been dissolved.  It may be that that is sufficient to enable Mr Yau to get registered as the new owner, but even if the expiry
of registration since 2013 is a problem and further steps have to be taken in the name of the company, it seems to me that Mr Yau
needs the restoration order to be able to deal with the problem effectively.  6.  In these circumstances, I consider it just that the company be restored to the Companies Register and there will be an order accordingly.","COMPANIES REGISTRY

the interested parties’ submissions generally and materially overlap with the applicant’s submissions, I do not think it is justified
and fair in the present circumstances to order two sets of costs against the Commissioner.  I would therefore make no order as to

of mediation seeks to achieve that.  Courts know that takes place but is wholly unaware of what is said or done under its umbrella.
 This mere reference to such a “without prejudice meeting” has no effect upon a court so the exclusion in principle of it is
in fact immaterial.  However, Mr Horace Wong SC declined the invitation despite his very general approach that nothing must be known
of any such meeting, but saying the reference to such a meeting was prejudicial even though he effectively conceded that there was
no prejudicial content in the letter. 22.  How essential the contents of the letter are to the plaintiffs’ case is not for me to assess.  If it does not carry the plaintiff’s

章晶历 v. 吴联模 [2017] HKCFI 1910; HCCT 48/2017 (27 October 2017),"17.  In my reasons for dismissing the ex parte application on 12 October 2017, I expressed the view that the fact that an award or judgment debtor did not cooperate in the execution
of the award or judgment against him could not be regarded as evidence of a risk of dissipation of assets.  What is stated in the
Report is, essentially, clearer or more detailed evidence that the respondent and DNK failed to cooperate in the execution process
against them, but the nature of the allegation against the respondent remains the same.  It seems clear that the respondent and DNK
are not willing to voluntarily pay the sums which they have been ordered to pay to the applicant under the Award, but I do not consider
that to be “solid evidence” of a risk of dissipation of assets for the purpose of granting a Mareva injunction. 18.  For the above reasons, I am not prepared to grant the interim injunction sought by the applicant. 19.  I give the following directions for the further conduct of the applicant’s summons dated 18 October 2017:-","吴联模

to protect the legal aid fund.  Their honest but erroneous interpretation as to children’s maintenance being excepted from DLA’s
first charge is not a reason to deprive them of costs.  Unlike Manley, the legal aid fund is not deprived in any way as the proposed Settlement is not yet finalized.  I am not satisfied that the solicitors’

GURUNG SUMITRA v. HOSPITAL AUTHORITY [2017] HKCFI 2421; HCPI 887/2013 (27 October 2017),"4.  I do not find that this is an exceptional case that allows me to change milestone dates. The late assignment of senior counsel by
the Legal Aid Department who then advises that additional expert evidence ought to be adduced is not an exceptional circumstance
which the court will rely upon to adjourn milestone trial dates. 5.  In this case, the trial dates could have been preserved if the plaintiff’s solicitors had been more diligent in fixing the hearing
date of the application to adduce additional expert evidence and, ignoring the convenience of counsel, if they had pressed my clerk
to fix an early date soon after the application was made in June 2017.  Somehow, they allowed some three months to pass to suit counsels’
convenience with the result that the matter was not considered by me until 17 September 2017. 6.  That is the reason why I have found myself in this uncomfortable situation of feeling pressured, of being put between a rock and
a hard place. However, thankfully, I have some availability in my diary – actually the availability is the result of the cancellation
of my leave, but that matters little – but because I have some availability, and because I am able to fix the trial to be heard
just some four months later, I find that I am able, in these fortuitous circumstances, to exercise my discretion in this matter by
balancing the needs of the parties: by balancing, on the one hand, the right of the parties to adduce relevant and probative evidence
on important issues, and, on the other hand, by affording to the opposite party a proper opportunity to address those new issues;
and, balancing those factors against a short, four months’  adjournment of the trial, I am prepared to adjourn the original milestone
trial dates to these new dates.","HOSPITAL AUTHORITY

HKSAR v. YIM SHEK WO [2017] HKCFI 2424; HCCC 164/2017 (27 October 2017),"44.  If the Accused had continued to have the difficulties which he manifested for some minutes at the customs area at Sha Tau Kok then
there might have been a real issue as to the fitness of the Accused which might have presented issues in connection with the voluntariness
of the admissions against interest made by the Accused in the sense that it may have been oppressive to continue to ask questions
of him which produced admissible material.  It may have been an issue for the exercise of the discretion of the court to exclude
otherwise admissible material on the usual criteria.  However, there was nothing in the CCTV or in the video recorded interview or
in the testimony of the police officers (which I accept) which caused me concern in relation to the various issues of admissibility
that might have otherwise arisen.  That the Accused may not have been in perfect condition is not to the point.  The issues that
arose in relation to the health of the Accused were not such at the time that he made the various admissions attributed to him to
have rendered those admissions involuntary.  Further, on no account could those admissions, specifically at the times they were made,
be excluded on the basis of an exercise of the court’s discretion. 45.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the testimony of the officers in rejecting the allegations of threats and inducements.
 I am satisfied the same standard that the health issues which manifested themselves at a particular point in time were such that
at the time that the admissions attributed to the Accused were made that they caused any basis for doubting the voluntariness of
those admissions.  There was nothing in the condition of the Accused which could possibly have justified the exclusion of the admissions
attributed to the Accused on the basis of an exercise of the discretion of the court. 46.  For those reasons, I admitted the impugned admissions.",Date of Reasons for Ruling: 27 October 2017(Andrew Bruce SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2424.html,"

to refuse to admit the proposed evidence.  The footnote is that even if the report was to be admitted the prosecution never addressed
the assumptions which underlie its use.  In particular, I have in mind what Dr Mak did in the report was simply to say that quantity
“X” divided by the average daily consumption rate “Y” we have the number of days for which this quantity of drug would have
lasted.  What implications that carries for the issue of whether an inference of possession for unlawful trafficking could be drawn
from the outcome of that equation would need to be addressed.  (This is no criticism of Dr Mak.  He simply provided what he believes
are the daily consumption rates and then did the math.)  The implications of this as a means of assisting the prosecution to prove
that the drugs in the possession of an accused were for unlawful trafficking was not a matter for him and (quite properly) he never
expressed an opinion in that regard.  This is a matter for the prosecution.  This might work out perfectly well for quite large quantities
and quite small ones.  The problem of quantities in the middle of that spectrum is more problematic.  The assumption that a drug
user only buys a small quantity at any one time for personal consumption is not an assumption which is necessarily valid.  In other
words, even if admitted, Dr Mak’s information is merely the start of the debate and is in no way its conclusion.  The issue is
the conversion of speculation to into evidence capable of proof to the criminal standard. 33.  The issues which arose in the case demonstrate how important and how great is the need for an authoritative study on consumption
rates in Hong Kong. 34.  The report written by Dr Mak and the proposed evidence to be given by him is inadmissible.  It was the 1st Accused who objected to the reception into evidence of this report.  Given the deficiencies of the report, I do not think it is fair
to admitted against the 2nd Accused.","LAM, AROON

CHU KONG v. LAU WING YAN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1916; HCA 226/2017 (30 October 2017),"23.  The applicant’s position is that as it has received full payment of the balance of the purchase price from D2, it would be prejudiced
if the court were to grant the declaration sought against it in the action which would involve the balance of the purchase price
having to be returned. 24.  Assuming that the supplemental agreement is held to be void, it does not follow that the applicant would necessarily suffer any
prejudice because for one thing the company must still perform the Contract by paying the balance of the purchase price to the applicant.
 In any event, it is no more than a possible consequence of a successful claim against D1 – D3.  It is hardly conceivable that
the relief the court would consider appropriate would not ensure that the effect on the applicant would be neutral. 25.  For those reasons, I have no hesitation in dismissing the summons.

there was no evidence of association between D4 and the defendants except for the outing on 27 and 28 May 2015 and his attendance
at electronic courses together with D3 and D5.  He further pointed out that D4 had no contact or involvement with the relevant defendants
in relation to the events on 14 June 2015.  He challenged the evidence of PW3 and PW4 and noted that Superintendent Roberts (PW34),
was unsure in his expert opinion about the observations of the police officers on 28 May 2015.  The various points and issues that
he has raised are matters for the jury to consider and determine.  42.  Mr Keith Fung, for D5, in oral submissions submitted that apart from the admissions made by D5 in the two VRIs and the video reconstruction,
there was no evidence of association between D5 and the others and nothing incriminating was found at his home when searched by the
police.  He sought to rely on the inconsistencies of D5’s answers in his caution statements but it would appear that there are
admissions contained in them that the prosecution can rely on in relation to Count 1.  43.  The matters raised by counsel for the defendants in their no case submissions do not justify taking the case away from the jury.
 There is in my view a case to answer against each of the defendants on the counts that they respectively face.  The matters that
they have raised are matters appropriately in the province of the jury and for them to consider together with all the other evidence
presented to them. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2401.html,"

Now I turn to the issue of costs. There is no reason why costs should not follow the event. Madam Leung and the Trustees should
pay the costs of Mr Chu of these proceedings including the Trustees’ counterclaim and all previously reserved costs. On the other
hand, I find the defence to be completely devoid of merits, particularly given the existence of the Consent Order. The affirmation
evidence of Madam Leung taken at its highest could not be sufficient to substantiate a plea of undue influence. In my view, Mr Chu
is entitled to indemnity costs against Madam Leung and the Trustees, to be taxed if not agreed. I make an order nisi in these terms. 68.  It crossed my mind that an order made under O.62 r.6(2), Rules of the High Court, against the Trustees might be appropriate but
I eventually decided against it, though I have to say it was not a straightforward question. I do expect that the Trustees, being
legal practitioners themselves, should exercise their expertise in the administration of the affairs of Madam Leung and should not
have taken Madam Leung’s words at face value. They really should have thought twice before taking any step in these proceedings.

RE Z-OBEE HOLDINGS LTD [2017] HKCFI 2204; [2018] 1 HKLRD 165; HCMP 1563/2017 (31 October 2017),"16.  The circumstances in which the Companies Court has and will exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement
made between the creditors of a company incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction and its creditors have been discussed in a number
of recent Hong Kong authorities, in particular the decision which I have just referred to, Re Winsway Enterprises Holdings Ltd, paras 23 to 31.  17.  In this regard the present case is straightforward.  As I have already mentioned a substantial proportion of the debt is governed
by Hong Kong law.  It is an established principle of Hong Kong law that a debt can only be compromised under the law governing the
debt: Gibbs v Societe Industrielle.[2] That and the desire to protect Z-Obee’s listed status in Hong Kong, which is central to the efficacy of this cross‑border restructuring,
clearly provide sufficient connection between Hong Kong and the scheme to justify this court exercising jurisdiction under section 673. 18.  I am satisfied that the necessary statutory majority was obtained at the scheme meeting, that the class was fairly represented by
those attending the meeting, and also that the arrangement is such as an intelligent and honest creditor might reasonably approve
as demonstrated by the unanimous vote in favour of the scheme.  I will therefore sanction the scheme introduced in Hong Kong.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2204.html,"

my view a non sequitur for the reasons explained in para 20.  If the Secretary for Justice will not intervene if there is somebody with the interest and
ability to act to protect the charity’s interests, it cannot sensibly be said that leave is not necessary.  25.  I answer the question posed in para 1 of the Company’s summons in the positive. 26.

or proceeds” of the Vehicle.  However, as earlier mentioned, there is no evidence that any part of the proceeds of sale of the
Vehicle (or Licence) is still in the hands of Mr Chin.  I am not prepared to exercise my discretion to grant an injunction in such
general terms. 28.  In passing, I should mention that at the hearing on 3 November 2017, the court specifically asked Mr Wong whether, in view of Mr
Yam’s decision not to pursue the application for a Mareva injunction, the proposed injunction was still appropriate.  Mr Wong maintained that it was still appropriate for the proprietary
injunction sought, but said that Mr Yam would be happy to abide by such amendments to the draft order as might be made by the court.
 As I informed Mr Wong, it was not for the court to draft an appropriate form of the injunction for his client.  This ought to be
so, particularly where Mr Yam was fully represented by counsel and solicitor whereas Mr Chin was absent at the hearing.  Mr Wong
did not put forward any revised draft order for the court’s consideration.  In the circumstances, Mr Yam’s application must be
considered on the basis of the draft order as annexed to his ex parte summons. 29.  For the above reasons, I refuse to grant the proprietary injunction sought by Mr Yam against Mr Chin.

SL v. KWAN BETTY [2017] HKCFI 1950; HCAL 247/2015 (6 November 2017),"83.  As for the COI materials, SL was legally represented at the 1st tier screening. He was in the best position to understand how he was to present his claim and to know what materials would assist
in establishing his claim. If he wanted the DOI to consider any particular materials (including COI materials), it was for him to
conduct his own investigation and obtain information/materials that he required to prove his case. The Court of Appeal held in CH v Director of Immigration that even the duty of “joint endeavour” does not entitle the claimant having stated a claim to simply sit back and require the
DOI to disprove it.[29] High standards of fairness did not require the DOI to keep probing and inquiring where the objective circumstances made it reasonably
clear that the claimant and those representing him were aware of what he had to show and had already produced or mentioned he all
that he wanted to produce or mention.[30] 84.  In my view, notwithstanding the scheduled Adjudicator Hearing, high standards of fairness did not in the present case require the
Adjudicator to hold an oral hearing to further probe and inquire in relation to SL’s claim. In the present context, SL when he
was under legal advice had been given a number of opportunities to provide information/ documents, and the Adjudicator after having
regard to all available materials/documents, including the NCF, records of the 1st/2nd Interviews and COI submitted and relied upon by the DOI and SL / his legal representative in the 1st tier, was entitled (even under the high standards of fairness and the duty to make enquiry) to consider SL as having been provided
with reasonable opportunities to submit all information he could have been able to provide and then under section 15(3) of Schedule 1A to the IO to assess and decide, based on such information/documents and SL’s explanation for his non-attendance,
whether it was necessary to hold an oral hearing, and if not to proceed with determine the appeal/petition. The Adjudicator had considered
the circumstances of SL in the context of his claim, and I am unconvinced the Adjudicator in deciding not to hold an oral hearing
to keep probing and enquiring was in breach of any procedural fairness and duty to make enquiry in the present circumstances in determining
the appeal/petition. 85.  In all the circumstances, I find there was substantial undue delay with no good reason to justify an extension of time, and there
was no reasonably arguable ground of review with a realistic prospect of success. I therefore dismiss (a) the Summons, and (b) SL’s
application to extend time for SL to apply for judicial review. That being the case, SL’s application for leave to apply for judicial
review falls away as it was out of time. I also grant a costs order nisi that there be no order as to costs in respect of SL’s applications.","15 December

NGUYEN THI THUY v. DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION [2017] HKCFI 1951; HCAL 306/2017 (6 November 2017),"5.  The applicant’s case purportedly in support of the assertion that she would be killed if she returns to Vietnam can be stated
briefly.  There was a time when the applicant was reasonably well off by reason of her successful estate agent business in Vietnam.
 A downturn of the Vietnam property market resulted in not only her business failure, but also her failure to repay a loan owed to
a local loan shark.  The applicant claims that the loan shark assaulted her and threatened to kill her because the applicant failed
to repay the loan.  The Vietnam police did not render any help to the applicant. Upon her mother’s advice, the applicant left Vietnam
for China in December 2014, and ultimately arrived in Hong Kong. 6.  This application suffers from various procedural and/or evidential defects/irregularities (see para 2 to 4 above).  Irrespective
of these inadequacies, a perusal of the challenged decisions shows that they have considered the applicant’s case in considerable
detail.  There is no detectable error of law on the face of the record.  There is no indication of other irregularities (whether
procedural or otherwise) either. 7.  In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that this application for leave has crossed the requisite threshold regarding merits,
and therefore refuse to give leave to apply.","DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION

郭卓堅 v. 林鄭月娥特首連同行政會議成員 [2017] HKCFI 1952; HCAL 453/2017 (6 November 2017),"11.  Mr Lee submits that a relevant factor in favour of making no order as to costs against Mr Kwok lies in the fact that there was another
application by two legally aided applicants (Messrs Lui and Li) who advanced precisely the same grounds for seeking leave to apply
for judicial review of the CEIC Decision.  Mr Lee says that the fact that legal aid was granted to those applicants shows that the
Director of Legal Aid was satisfied that the grounds relied upon by them (and therefore the grounds relied upon by Mr Kwok) were
reasonably arguable.  I do not consider the existence of that other application relying on the same grounds to challenge the CEIC
Decision to be a relevant consideration, just as it would not be a relevant consideration that (i) Messrs Lui and Li were pursuing
their application which may mean, arguably, that there was no need for Mr Kwok to pursue his own application, or (ii) two other applicants
(Messrs Tsang and Cheung) decided not to pursue their respective applications shortly before the hearing.  In my view, the question
of whether Mr Kwok should be ordered to pay the costs of the putative respondent in the present application should be considered
on its own merits and not be influenced by the other applications. 12.  In all the circumstances, I consider that there are good reasons to depart from the general rule of making no order as to costs
against Mr Kwok who was unsuccessful in his application for leave to apply for judicial review.  Accordingly, his summons dated 10
October 2017 is dismissed with costs to the putative respondent, to be taxed if not agreed. 13.  Lastly, it remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance rendered to the court.","林鄭月娥特首連同行政會議成員

RE RAD SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES ASIA LTD [2017] HKCFI 2235; HCCW 253/2017 (6 November 2017),"5.  The procedural complication in the present case is that the petition was amended on 24 August 2017 to correct some infelicitous
language in para 3 of the petition which describes the capital of the Company and the affidavit verifying the amended petition was
not filed until 30 October 2017.  6.  Although the language of rule 32(1) of the Winding Up Rules does not directly apply to the situation where before evidence in opposition
is filed an amended petition and further verifying affidavit is filed, it seems to me that although not entirely clear, for the purposes
of rule 32(1), the relevant time is the filing of the most recent verifying affidavit. That means that although it is entirely fortuitous
the Company has filed evidence in opposition within the time period specified in the Winding Up Rules and, therefore, does not require
leave to rely on Mr Zhao’s affirmation, the consequence, it seems to me, of this is that it would not be appropriate to impose
a condition on the Company being allowed to defend the petition even if that might have been what would have happened if the petition

to the agreed undertakings and the condition imposed by this Court.  76.  I will ask the parties to submit an agreed draft order reflecting the orders made, for this court’s approval. 77.  The plaintiffs have abandoned part of the Reliefs sought by them, in the originating summons and succeeded with some Reliefs but
subject to a condition.  The defendants have succeeded with their Counterclaim but subject to undertakings and condition imposed
by the Court. In my view, a fair order for costs will be no order as to costs.  This is an order nisi, which shall be made final

COSMIGO LTD v. MONIN ASIA KL SDN BHD [2017] HKCFI 2136; HCMP 905/2017 (8 November 2017),"11.  As the Companies Court has endeavoured to make clear on various occasions, petitions to wind up companies, particularly companies
which there is no reason to think are insolvent, should only be made in straightforward cases where it is clear to the petitioner’s
lawyers that there is little ground for the debtor company to dispute liability.  If there is doubt about this, then the prudent
course is to proceed to obtain judgment to recover the sums believed to be payable.  12.  So far as I can see from the papers which I have before me, this is a case, which in my view, it should have been appreciated was
not suitable for the winding-up procedure.  It may be that that was not immediately apparent at the time the statutory demand was
issued, but it seems to me that if an objective view had been taken of the information that I would imagine would clearly have become
available during the course of April 2017, that should have been the conclusion that was reached, and it should have been agreed
that the statutory demand be withdrawn.  13.  It seems to me that in the circumstances it is, therefore, appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision on Costs: 8 November 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2136.html,"

evidence and her conduct is very suspicious.   31.  To maintain the proper administration of justice in Hong Kong, a clear message must be sent to the public that court orders must
be strictly complied with. Absent any mitigating factors, this court should mark the disapproval at Madam Lau’s knowing and serious
breach of the Injunction by an immediate custodial sentence. 32.  Having looked at the matter in the round, I commit Madam Lau to prison for 28 days.

in disclosing the 2010 Will less than satisfactory.  He can at the very least be criticised for taking what appears to be a very
nonchalant approach to the questions of probate of the wills of the Deceased and his defence of this action until the eve of the
trial. 27.  In summary, upon the defendant’s undertaking to prosecute the Probate Action expeditiously and on condition that the defendant
pays into court HK$1.5 million with 21 days: 27.  Mr Albert Yau, counsel for the plaintiff, has invited me to give further case management directions for the 2 matters such as that

given that the writ of summons in the Probate Action has just been issued and those proceedings have not taken shape yet, I decline

substantive rights of the parties. 7.  Balancing all these considerations, I am persuaded that I ought to exercise my discretion to grant leave to the plaintiff to file

The second prong (being the fourth error of law) is that the defendants’ summons should have been dismissed because there was
no serious issue to be tried as against SVK, and further, that an injunction was unnecessary since SVK could only act in accordance
with the directions of the lenders against whom injunctions are in place.  22.  As stated in §118 of the Decision, there is no requirement that there be a cause of action as such against the party to be served

about proceeding with the transaction without obtaining both thorough written legal advice on 8 December 2010 and some more information
about the attitude of other shareholders in Liu’s Holdings about the proposed transaction.  It seems to me also arguable that the
Deacons’ letter of 17 January 2011 should have brought home to him that the restrictions on transfer of the Sale Shares were not
mere technicalities, but suggested a more serious problem might exist which went to the commercial viability of the transaction.
 It seems to me that it is in this regard, rather more than by approving the announcement in the Circular, that it is arguable that
Mr Best was in breach of duty.  Or to put it in language more relevant, given the relevant criteria: it does not seem to me that
it is plain and obvious that Mr Best had not, at least in some regards, failed in his duties as a director of the Company. 50.  Can it be said at this stage that it is plain and obvious that even if the court found Mr Best had breached his duties in the manner
I have referred to, the breaches are plainly and obviously not capable of justifying the serious sanction of disqualification?  In
my view, it cannot.  I, of course, express no view on the strength of the case against Mr Best, but I am not satisfied at this stage
that it is plain and obvious that after a trial of the Petition, it will not be possible, when Mr Best’s conduct comes to be considered
in the overall context of this case, to justify the imposition of disqualification for some period. 51.

 The criticisms advanced in support of this application are largely forensic analysis of parts of the evidence of the SFC.  I agree
with the submissions of the SFC that the evidence must be evaluated as a whole and in its proper context.  There are ample contemporaneous
documents which will assist the court to determine the merits of Tang’s case. 14.  This application must be properly justified. The court looks at the substance of the assertions that the deponents are untruthful.
 The exercise is not one of combing through the evidence with a microscope and say, eg, that X had failed to mention in his evidence
the presence of Y[1]. There can be a number of explanations for the omission.  Unless there is adequate reason to believe that the omission was something
sinister, cross-examination would only serve the purpose of a fishing exercise. 15.  For these reasons, this

whether the delay in enforcing the Loan Agreement had caused any loss to the Plaintiff when it is agreed that it was a sour loan.
 There is certainly no evidence of proof of any loss or how it flowed from the breach of duty of care.  71.  Mr Chu argued that the Plaintiff had lost HK$7.5 million (the principal of the Loan), and that the Plaintiff had lost the opportunity
to extract that sum from Chau and Chiu.  With respect, that the arguments are fundamentally misconceived and contrary to the evidence.
 The sour loan could not have a value of HK$7.5 million.  The parties negotiating the settlement were all shrewd businessmen.  Chau
and Chiu would not have agreed to accept any personal responsibility over that sour loan or the CN. This is reflected by the evidence,
eg, that Chau refused Tang’s request to stand as warrantor to the Agreement.  72.  For the above reasons, I dismiss this action with an order nisi that the costs of this action be paid by the Plaintiff, to be taxed

apportion these costs until 28 July 2017, when the Creditor provided the separate amounts of the Interim Order Costs and the Appeal

in Sunny Tadjudin v Bank of America, National Association (HCA 322/2008).  It is clear that post CJR, the court should give effect to the underlying objectives of the rules and procedures
when it exercises its power under Order 24, and when it interprets the provisions of Order 24.  In deciding whether any document
relates to the matter in question in the action, whether any document is or has been in the possession, custody or power of the party,
and whether discovery of a document sought is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, the
court should always bear in mind the objectives of cost-effectiveness, expeditious disposal of cases, proportionality, procedural
economy, and insurance of fairness between the parties.  18.  If I turn to consider the categories of documents which the defendants seek, I would first observe that they are extremely broad
in their nature, and secondly, that in many cases, they seek categories of documents which are, or should already have been, in the
defendant’s possession, or in respect of which there is no clear evidence of their relevance.  I am not satisfied that the documents,
discovery of which is sought, have been specifically identified so as to be clear of their existence, nor am I persuaded that such
categories are necessarily relevant to the matters in issue in the action, and these are prerequisites for the exercise of my discretion.
 The lateness of this application without any explanation would, in any event, militate against my exercising the discretion I have
here.  That is the conclusion of my decisions. 19.  I make an order that the defendants should pay the plaintiff’s costs because I think, in this case, the costs should follow the

on the facts of this case must be that it was they who had so packaged the drugs in the premises and they were, at the time of the
arrest, having joint control of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 33.  In other words, I reject D1’s claim that he had only been given HK$2,000 for storing the drugs. I also reject D2’s claim that
he had not been promised, nor had received, any reward for the part he took in the offence.  Having considered all the relevant circumstances,

primary facts so proved, the Magistrate was entitled to draw the irresistible inference which led to the conviction of both Appellants.
 The Appellants were providing manual labour at the material time, and they were taking employment while each of them was a person
in respect of whom a removal order was in force. 13.  As regards appeal against sentence, there was no specific grounds put forward by the Appellants.  The Magistrate followed the sentencing
direction promulgated by the Court of Appeal[6]. I cannot see any grounds to suggest that the sentence so imposed was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. 14.  Having considered all the circumstances of the case and for the reasons given above, I rule that the appeal against both conviction

was only represented by their solicitor, Mr Ching, on the other hand the time spent by the parties in arguing over the 1st category is the most substantial among the different categories sought under the 1st summons but the defendants failed in the 1st category.  Not only that, the defendants had also written several letters to the court after the hearing in relation to their application
for seeking leave to adduce further affidavit evidence on matters about the authenticity of the title deeds.  This necessitated the
plaintiff to write a letter in response, and the defendants also failed in such application. 64.  In these circumstances, it is just and fair to make no order as to costs of the 1st summons. 65.

experts have missed the point. I reached my decision on 19 September 2017 for the special reason set out in §3 above and I specifically
stated that I did not want this decision to be a precedent and that there were many factors that needed to be considered and debated
before the court could set out established principles in this area. I identified in my decision some of those factors which would
need to be debated at an appropriate time in a future case. 6.  Once I permitted the plaintiff to rely on Professor Nutting, it followed that I ought to permit him to instruct an overseas radiologist
to enable ease of communication between him and Professor Nutting, just as the defendant’s expert oncologist in Hong Kong would
enjoy ease of communication with the defendant’s expert radiologist in Hong Kong.  I do not see any merit in the grounds of appeal

In contrast, my attention has been drawn to the modified approach adopted by Johnson Lam J (as he then was) in Golden Eagle International (Group) Ltd v GR Investment Holdings Ltd [2010] HKCFI 569; [2010] 3 HKLRD 273 at [16]-[19] and followed in, for example, Shih P    ik Nog, supra, at [15]-[16], under which enhanced interest on costs is awarded at 4.5% per annum (being half the full enhanced commercial rate of
9% per annum) from the last date of acceptance without requiring leave up to the judgment date regardless of the actual dates on
which the defendant or his insurers had put up funds on account of costs. The adoption of such modified approach in the instant case
would however yield the higher figure of $189,431.19 according to my computation. 15.  As the purpose of awarding interest on costs at an enhanced rate is not to penalise a plaintiff for not accepting a sanctioned payment
but to compensate the defendant for the costs of money (or the loss of the use of money) which he has had to bear before trial in
relation to payments which he has made on account of costs (see cases cited by Bharwaney J in Shih Pik Nog, supra, at [11]-[12]), I propose not to follow the modified approach under which the plaintiff would end up paying more enhanced interest
on costs. 16.  For these reasons, I allow the defendant’s application and vary the costs order nisi dated 31 August 2017 as follows:","YICK HING CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED

if I was to find in their favour they should get the costs not only of this summons but also the abortive costs associated with the
summons for final judgement and/or judgement on admissions, which I adjourned pending this decision.  The plaintiff’s submission
was that even in relation to this summons I should make a cost order nisi, and that if I were to find for the defendant the question of the costs of the adjourned summons should be reserved for a separate
hearing. 31.  There was no dispute between the parties that there was an arbitration clause in the contracts between them and having satisfied
myself that the defendant has established good grounds that the action be stayed and referred to arbitration, it follows in my judgement
that the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs with a certificate for two counsel. I also consider that those costs should
be payable immediately. 32.  As to the costs of the adjourned summons, this was not of course formally heard but, given my decision and in light of the submissions
I heard on costs which impliedly accepted that the plaintiff’s summons depended on the plaintiff succeeding on this application,
I make an order dismissing the plaintiff’s adjourned summons and ordering that the costs should also be payable immediately by
the plaintiff to the defendant.  I note in this connection that the plaintiff’s summons was issued after the defendant’s acknowledgement

As to costs between P and the 2nd defendant, as I have said, it was pursuant to the said amended consent of Master de Souza that the 2nd defendant was given leave to join in the action as the 2nd defendant.

On 18 October 2017, I gave leave to the 2nd defendant to withdraw his defence and counterclaim, as I have said.  It seems to me that the 2nd defendant is entitled to his costs up to 29 June 2015.

It is not entirely clear what the taxed costs of the 2nd security for costs application are because the Allocatur in question covered other interlocutory applications.  I am informed that
a reasonable assessment of the taxed costs of the 2nd security for costs application is one half of the total taxed costs.  I am happy to accept the suggestion subject to it being verified
on affirmation.  Ms Cheung, appearing on behalf of Herbert Smith, has agreed to provide the affirmation. 19.  In the premises, I make an order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 of the Summons filed on 3 April 2017 save that: (i) the payment be

 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the decision on costs and interest and its comprehension. 
It does not mean those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have
also been considered. 24.  At one stage, the plaintiffs’ solicitors repeatedly requested the court to hand down a “corrigendum” regarding interest on
the judgment sum.  The reason why that matter (and the costs of this action) was not considered has been mentioned in para 4 above.
 As experience (and the contents of the parties’ subsequent written submissions) shows, this is a matter where the parties ought
to be given a proper opportunity to state their case.  It is thus not properly a matter for a “corrigendum”. 25.  Similar to what happened in the main claim in this action, neither party has been entirely successful.  The costs in relation to

of the case.  I also find it difficult to accept that one needs to relinquish a handhold to get into the cab of the lorry.  I do
not understand why one cannot turn one’s body while holding on to the steering wheel. 29.  All in all, I find that the plaintiff has not satisfied me, on the balance of probabilities that it was raining on the day of the
accident.  Therefore, that even if there was negligence in failure of repair of the cab by the 1st defendant, that cannot have been the cause of the accident and the plaintiff’s injuries. At the very least, the plaintiff has not
satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that it was so.  While I have sympathy for the plaintiff, who did suffer from injuries,
and whose employer, the 1st defendant, has obviously acted in a very atrocious manner towards him, I am afraid that the evidence does not enable me to find liability
established on the part of the 1st defendant. Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. 30.  I order that costs be to the 2nd defendant.

should apply the law firmly and consistently.  However, the court stated in Bayanmunkh that the extension of mercy has always been part of a judge’s armory in dispensing justice.  34.  There has been a plea of guilty from the outset, there is clear contrition by the Appellant.  It is evident that this is one such
case where the court should extend mercy to the Appellant.  In this case upon consultation with all collateral contacts as mentioned
above the probation officer has recommended that the Appellant be reunited with his family.  The wife has no relations or friends.
 The family have no support.  Although there is follow up and assistance from ISS, that has proved to be insufficient for this family
in these circumstances.  There is credible evidence that the Appellant’s absence from his wife and children has been highly detrimental
to the health and welfare of the family.  The accumulation of the personal circumstances of the family as highlighted in the second
SWR including those that have arisen post-sentence are in my view wholly exceptional circumstances for the court to temper justice
with mercy.  35.  I accept that on the specific facts of this case it is appropriate that leniency be extended to the Appellant.  As the Appellant
has served part of the sentence initially imposed, I allow the appeal and reduce the sentence to one of 4 months’ imprisonment
in order for the Appellant to be released immediately.","SALEEM ASAD

TANG SIU WING AND ANOTHER v. THE COMMISSIONER OF ESTATE DUTY [2017] HKCFI 2230; HCED 1/2013 (24 November 2017),"9.  However, with respect, whether one describes the joint expert report as mentioning no such database, or there being a database or
online register, the experts’ evidence was very clear – there was no record in any of the electronic database or otherwise of
the Companies Registry relating to Wasonga.  The skeleton file, reconstructed no later than 2013, could not be traced despite enquiries
by the respondent’s solicitors in Kenya for at least one year up to the date of the trial.  In those circumstances, the court’s
finding that it cannot place weight on the company records as showing the truth of the contents was a finding based on evidence existing
before the court.  There was ample evidence, even if this court had erred in stating that there was no database, to support the findings
of the court not to accept Mr Nyandoro’s evidence that the original was with him. 10.  Considering the three grounds, I am not satisfied that any of them have reasonable prospect of success and I decline to grant leave
to appeal. 11.  Costs be to the respondent to be taxed if not agreed. ",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2230.html,"

 However, the plaintiffs are not representing the Tso although they are beneficiaries of the Tso.  I make no comment on the merits
of this application, but for the failure to follow the Beddoe procedure, it is not appropriate for the court at this stage to allow withdrawal of close to a million dollars for a piece of litigation

of the court performing a public function and have switched to serve their new master in persecuting the Father and in actively pursuing
their new master’s and their personal interest.  They did not respect their position as officers of the court and did not respect
the court’s findings.  They tried to avoid or nullify the court’s findings in order to advance Ken’s interest.  They did not
act in the interest of those entitled to the asset of the Company.  They abused the power the court bestowed on them.  They tried
to create work and profits for themselves.  In particular, their conduct in relation to the “recent hidden” tax liability issue
was ugly.  The way they conducted this liquidation was shameful.  They have completely forfeited the confidence of the court.  I
am mindful that these are harsh comments may have a serious impact on their professional practice.  But the way they conducted the
liquidation asked for these harsh comments.  The only course now open to this court is to remove them from their appointmentwith
an advice to the Official Receiver to review their suitability as liquidators. 132.   For the above reasons, I grant the Petitioner’s application to stay the Winding-up Order permanently and to remove the Liquidators.
 To reflect the court’s feeling of indignation and condemnation of their conduct, the Liquidators should pay the Petitioner’s
costs of the application on indemnity basis.  Though Ken’s position is somewhat different from that of the Liquidators, his conduct,
which was what gave rise to the Liquidators’ conduct, and the way he contested the application also justify indemnity costs against
him.  Accordingly, I make a costs order that the 1st Respondent and the Liquidators shall pay the Petitioner’s costs of the application on indemnity basis with certificate for four
counsel.  133.   I apologise to the parties for the time taken in my deliberation.  I thank the legal teams of the parties for their contribution.

MARRAKESH INVESTMENTS LTD v. TANGIERS HOLDINGS LTD AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2343; HCCW 352/2016 (28 November 2017),"18.  As I have already explained, it is well established that a petition seeking a winding-up order against a solvent company by a shareholder
should state why a winding-up order rather than a share buy‑out order may be necessary.  To present a petition which does not do
so is prima facie an abuse of process.  Of course there will be occasions in which the failure to include a precise reason for seeking a winding-up
order will be an oversight or result from infelicities in the drafting of the petition.  It does not, however, seems to me that this
is such a case.  19.  The problems with the 1st petition should have focused minds on the criteria which apply to petitions of this sort.  The fact that the present petition makes
no reference to, for example, a concern about the 1st respondent’s ability to buy the shares of the petitioner suggests that there was no motivation in presenting the 2nd petition other than putting pressure on the 1st respondent to improve his offer.  The subsequent conduct of the proceedings which I have referred to earlier by the petitioner also
points to the conclusion that this, at each stage of the proceedings, is what has motivated the petitioner.  Even the fact that it
was not until immediately before the present hearing, and I understand from Mr Ho that he was only instructed yesterday, that the
petitioner agreed to the present petition being dismissed suggests that the petitioner’s approach is driven purely by commercial
considerations rather than the sort of considerations relevant to the inclusion of a prayer for a winding-up order.  20.  It does, therefore, seem to me that this is an appropriate case to make not only a costs order against the petitioner with a certificate
for two counsel, but also to order that the petitioner pays the costs of the petition on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 28 November 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2343.html,"

the interim stay sought by the applicant) and that they were to make submissions on grounds other than those that could be made by
the TPB (see Yiu Lian’s original substantive skeleton submissions opposing).  These amount to additional justifications to also
order costs against the applicant in favour of them. 21.  Finally, the applicant has submitted that she should not bear the putative parties’ costs incurred in preparing the opposing affirmations
as they were initially filed without leave of the court.  I am unable to accept this submission. First, before the applicant withdrew
her application, the parties had in correspondence contested on whether leave should be granted for the filing of those affirmations.
 She therefore was aware of the potentiality that leave might be granted eventually.  Second and in any event, leave was indeed subsequently
granted to the filing of those affirmations before she decided to withdraw the leave application.  In the premises, there are no reasons why the costs of affirmation should not be
treated as part and parcel of the putative parties’ costs of the leave application. 22.  For the above reasons, I order that costs of the leave application (including the costs of the opposing affirmations) be to the

In all, I find that Angela’s claims against the 1st and 2nd defendants are time-barred.  I have reached this conclusion with some regret.  I have also some considerable misgivings about the
business ethics of the 1st and/or 2nd defendants.  Irrespective of whether Johnathon did in fact make the alleged misrepresentations to induce Angela to purchase the large
number of policies, on any objective view of the matters, those policies were plainly beyond Angela’s reasonable needs or means,
and that must have been obvious to the 1st and/or 2nd defendants.  In the absence of any explanation, one could only conclude that the 1st and 2nd defendants were driven purely by a profit-making motive to sell so many policies to Angela within a period of some 5 years regardless
of her proper interest.  This is not a matter which the court can take any further, but may properly be investigated by the Insurance
Authority. 65.  I refuse Angela’s application to re‑amend the Statement of Claim in so far as the 1st and 2nd defendants are concerned, and dismiss her action against them.

as the right to attend and vote at company’s meeting is concerned, the register is conclusive, but not for other purposes.  There
is obvious policy reason for such a rule of convenience.  But these cases did not go that far as to support the proposition that
the entries in the register is conclusive evidence of membership.  In fact, there is strong authority to the contrary.  In Reese River Silver Mining Co Ltd v Smith[5], Lord Westbury held that the register is only prima facie but not conclusive evidence.  The court would always look at the factual circumstances of the case.  He said[6]: 16.  Having come to the conclusion that the Petitioner has no locus standi to present this petition, there is no need to consider the second ground for striking out.  Indeed, to commence proceedings which
are bound to fail is in itself an abuse of process.  I do not intend to consider the grounds of the petition.  Even if the Petitioner
has an arguable case, he is bound to fail as he has no locus standi.  I cannot help thinking that his motive for presenting the petition was to put pressure on the 2nd Respondentto settle his contractual claim under the Agreement.  Even if he is a victim of breach of the Agreement, his remedy should
lie in contract against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. Maybe he has other difficulties in bringing an action in contract.  That is not a reason to present a petition for winding

on where the Fund has gone because the Receipt was dated after the prescribed period for payment to Shanghai Yu Hang.  I do not need
to decide on this point.  On the evidence of the defendant, the Fund was in the defendant’s control for a short period of time.
It is in respect of this short period of time that the plaintiff requires an account from the defendant. 29.  I am satisfied that the information sought (which is limited to movement from the time when the Fund was deposited into the defendant’s
account to the time when the same was transferred to the defendant’s personal friend) is not oppressive, and should be within the
power of the defendant. 30.  I have therefore made an order for account at the hearing with costs to the plaintiff and summarily assessed.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 30 November 2017(Elaine Liu),Master of the High Court,/2017/2138.html,"

I give judgment for the plaintiff accordingly together with an order for costs against the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed with costs. 95.  Her position has been compromised by the fact that she has beenrepresented by the solicitors for the 1st defendant. There was obviously a conflict of interest and she should have been separately represented.  She has been used, as a consequence,
to support the case of the 1st defendant by giving evidence for him.  She was used by him to facilitate his actions to assert belatedly his claim to possession
and to take steps to interfere with that part of Lot 965 to which the plaintiff has successfully established adverse possession. 96.  Whilst she was unwise, to say the least, to involve herself in any part of the 1st defendant’s activities in 2013/2014, there is no basis for any judgment against her.  Therefore she is entitled to have the claim
against her dismissed and I do so.  However there will be no costs order in her favour as she was used as part of his co-defendant’s

for me slavishly to repeat them.  There is no defence to this action.  The lapse of time between the service of the Statement of
Claim and the issue of the Order 14 application is not in the circumstances of this case of any significance.  There are probably
many reasons why the plaintiff in view of its position as a charity in the United States, Hong Kong and elsewhere decided to hold
its hand for a while to see how matters might resolve themselves but it is pointless to seek to identify them.  Its prime objective
was, and is, humanitarian medical treatment based heavily on volunteer professional expertise and generous benefactors — the heavy
expenditure of funds on litigation is not a priority. 44.  There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the terms prayed for in paragraphs 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Statement of
Claim. 45.  There will also be an order for costs in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant.  I am conscious that this burden will fall
upon the funds donated to the defendant by benefactors and sponsors who may well be largely unaware of the defendant’s rationale.
 In relation to that I am compelled to say that in my view it was poor judgment and irresponsible to commit a charity to this litigation

as the right to attend and vote at company’s meeting is concerned, the register is conclusive, but not for other purposes.  There
is obvious policy reason for such a rule of convenience.  But these cases did not go that far as to support the proposition that
the entries in the register is conclusive evidence of membership.  In fact, there is strong authority to the contrary.  In Reese River Silver Mining Co Ltd v Smith[5], Lord Westbury held that the register is only prima facie but not conclusive evidence.

was no objection put forward by the Father in this respect.  This should be more than sufficient to cover her costs up to the stage
of completion of all discovery and the preparation of the analysis by an accountant.   92.  In any event, as seen above, the Mother’s financial disclosure so far has not been satisfactory, in particular in relation to
the HKD13.7m and also the supporting documentation of ILB’s expenses and also her own financial resources.  As seen from Currey and Currey, and also HJFG and KCY, the burden is on the Mother to demonstrate that she cannot reasonably procure legal advice and representation by any other means,

she has not satisfied the Currey test.  As this stage, I am not prepared to exercise my discretion in favour of the Mother, or make any order for costs allowance

month, mainly to pay staff, including mandatory provident funds. Mr Chan’s objection is that the defendants have not provided clear
evidence that they have no other assets to pay the relevant expenses.  However, it is relevant that (i) the Mareva injunction currently restrains the defendants from dealing with or disposing of assets up to the huge sum of HK$362,848,000, (ii)
the existing order only allows the defendants to spend HK$50,000 per week by way of business expenses which, I take it, was set without
much consideration of the actual requirements of the defendants, as one would expect when an ex parte Mareva injunction is sought (I should make it clear that this observation is not intended to be a criticism), and (iii) there is evidence
that the 2nd defendant has to pay salaries to 13 to 14 employees.  Obviously, the court should be careful not to do anything which may result
in those employees being left without payment of salaries.  I am also minded to fix an early hearing date of the discharge applications. 8.   In all the circumstances, I shall vary paragraph (1) of the “Exception to this Order” as per paragraph 3 of the schedule to

received by Incorp, after the remittance made by THL to Incorp on 29 May 2015 of the earnest money of €2 million paid by THL under
the Agreement.  The appendix was initialed by Goh.  It is unbelievable that Goh had no knowledge of the use of the earnest money,

the distribution rights granted thereunder, was issued to WW Premium, instead of WW China, if Goh and THL had not in fact consented
to the use of WW Premium as the joint venture vehicle to which the Exclusive Right was to be granted pursuant to the Agreement. 25.  On the facts shown and on the evidence available at this stage, I consider that Chan has raised factual matters in dispute which

HKSAR v. KARDEEP SINGH [2017] HKCFI 2168; HCMA 444/2017 (4 December 2017),"40.  In the present case, the magistrate has carefully analyzed the evidence of the witnesses.  She has given detailed reasons as to
why the evidence of PC 13607 was preferred but not the appellant’s.  In my view, the findings of the magistrate are sound and there
is nothing illogical or inherently improbable in her findings.  In the circumstances, the conviction of the appellant should be upheld. 41.  In fairness to the appellant, counsel for the respondent has raised several matters which the magistrate possibly should have considered
when assessing the credibility of the appellant’s version of events.  However, these points were not raised by the appellant at
trial, who was represented by experienced counsel.  These are matters of mixed law and facts.  I do not consider that these points
can properly be dealt with on appeal, without the evidential basis thereof having been suitably established at trial. 42.  For the reasons stated above, the appellant’s appeal against his conviction is dismissed.","KARDEEP SINGH

to provide suitable accommodation for her and the son.  Hence, this would not qualify as a humanitarian consideration.  29.  Further, as stated by McWalters J (as he then was) in HKSAR v Bayanmunkh [2012] HKCA 164; [2012] 2 HKC 233, at paragraph 13, the adverse effect of imprisonment upon an offender’s family would not normally be taken into account in sentencing.

CHEUNG KIN POR v. TANG ZHANQUAN [2017] HKCFI 2407; HCA 2506/2016 (4 December 2017),"33.  These having been said, the defendant’s case is not without difficulties either.  In particular:- 34.  Overall, I consider that there are significant unsatisfactory features in both the plaintiff’s case and the defendant’s case
on the present state of the pleadings and affirmations. It is possible that the discrepancies, inconsistencies and queries in the
plaintiff’s case can be satisfactorily explained at the trial upon a detailed consideration of the evidence.  However, I do not
consider that such exercise can properly be undertaken in the context of the present summary judgment application where the evidence
of the parties has not been tested by cross examination.  It follows that I do not consider that this is a proper case to grant summary
judgment to the plaintiff at this stage. 35.  For the foregoing reasons, I grant unconditional leave to the defendant to defend this action. On the question of costs, I consider
that the fair order to make is that costs should be in the cause of this action, and I so order.","TANG ZHANQUAN（湯湛泉）

2012).  These again further strengthened my view that the failure to caution D2 had no effect whatsoever in his willingness to assist. 41.  Criticism had been made by counsel for D2 in the lack of contemporaneous records by the experts and the police, making it difficult
for D2 to answer the allegations.  Bearing in mind that D2 was basically repeating what he had already told Dr Tonny Ng on the first
few occasions about the process of the CIK treatment and the various steps, I did not find that the lack of any contemporaneous records
made by all the experts and/or investigating officers of importance, particularly when Dr Tonny Ng and his assistant had indeed made
handwritten notes which were incorporated into a rather detailed interim report. 42.  I did not find there was any unfairness in the treatment of D2 which warranted for the exercise of my residual discretion to exclude
admissible evidence.","MAK Wan-ling

dismiss the plaintiff’s application as against the 1st defendant.  It is clearly not equitable to allow the action to proceed against the 1st defendant.  I therefore find that the plaintiff’s claim against the 1st defendant to be time barred. 68.  As regards to the application against the 2nd defendant, the writ has yet to be served so, of course, no defence of time limitation has been raised by the 2nd defendant.  It also follows that the Summons has not been served to the 2nd defendant.  It is therefore entirely premature to seek such an application against the 2nd defendant.  I also note that even now, the plaintiff does not know the current address of the 2nd defendant to effect service.   69.

beneficial interest of the Property was with the Son “since June 2010” or at least at the time of the Bankruptcy Order. Even
if I were to consider the Resolution (which I have found I should not), its terms showed the “DISTRIBUTION ADVANCEMENT” allegedly
took effect on 18 August 2017, which was far too late to have any legal effect. The relevant time for consideration was the date
of the Bankruptcy Order (ie 16 August 2016). It would not be possible to make distribution in relation to the Grantors’ interest
in the Property after 16 August 2016. 26.  I am not persuaded the proposed grounds of appeal had any reasonable prospects of success, and the Leave Summons is dismissed. There
shall be a costs order nisi that costs of the Leave Summons be paid by the Bankrupt personally to the TiB to be taxed if not agreed. 27.  At the Leave Hearing, the Bankrupt expressed his frustration that it appeared from information provided by the TiB that the TiB’s
income, costs and dividend exceeded $1.8 million, which translated into nil distribution to the creditors. However, this complaint

HKSAR v. SZE KA YIM [2017] HKCFI 2213; HCCC 334/2016 (14 December 2017),"11. Section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance sets out the requirements and power for a hospital order in respect of mentally disordered offenders.  The purpose of this power
is to appropriately deal with and treat a mentally disordered offender by addressing the issue and also ensuring the future protection
of the public.  It is therefore important that an hospital order specifies whether the offender should be committed to a psychiatric
centre or a mental hospital and whether that should be for a determinate or indeterminate period.  It is for this reason that such
an order must be supported by medical evidence from two medical practitioners, one of which under section 46 is required to be a medical officer. 12.  From the information at hand, I am of the view, that the defendant has a serious mental disorder and poses as a grave threat to
members of the public.  He has engaged in acts of violence in the past that has led the relevant medical authorities to classify
him as a target person, that is, a potentially violent case.  Unfortunately, the defendant’s proneness to violence has resulted
in the death of his mother.  His long history of aggressive and violent behaviour warrants that the hospital order be for an indeterminate
period.  This is supported by the psychiatric evidence. 13.  In accordance with section 45, having been satisfied that the requirements have been met or fulfilled, I order that the defendant be committed to a Correctional
Services Department Psychiatric Centre for an indeterminate period, pursuant to section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.  The recommendation of the two government psychiatrists is that the defendant be committed to the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre.

was a lack of sound of kicking of the offside rear fender.”[8]  While the Magistrate said he “acquitted the Defendant because Mr Tong’s evidence, which was crucial to the Prosecution case,
could not be relied upon”, it was: 10.  In my view, it is clear that the Appellant had brought suspicion on him and the Magistrate was entitled not to grant costs in favour

it was an invitation to submit further facts. It was grossly unfair that a decision was made without a supplementary interview and
an opportunity for him to explain himself further. He was hampered by an inability to understand the contents of the letter. 29.  However, during the hearing before me the applicant admitted that he was not in fact prejudiced in any way because he had had no
further information to submit to the Director to support a claim under a BOR 2 risk ground. There was no merit in this ground. 30.  The application for leave is refused. I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator. I see no

Presiding Officer failed to consider (i) the actual loss suffered by the Employer, and (ii) whether the amount payable by the employee
under the aforesaid clause was a genuine pre-estimate of the likely damages which might be suffered by the Employer upon an early
termination of the employment.  It is accepted, however, by Mr Yam that that materials and calculation which the Employer put forward
before the Presiding Officer as evidence of its “loss or damage” were only adduced in closing submissions and were therefore
rejected by the Presiding Officer. Moreover, even if those materials and calculation are taken at their face value, they only show
the eventual loss or damage allegedly suffered by the Employer as a result of the early termination of the employment contract. 
 In no way do they represent or reflect any genuine pre‑estimate of the damages which the Employer might suffer as a result of an early termination of the employment contract.  Mr Yam has not identified

HKSAR v. WALSH KENT ANDREW [2017] HKCFI 2246; HCCC 368/2015 (15 December 2017),"6.  He relies on the expression that the court can “direct otherwise” of the wording of the subsection.  As is apparent, this is
an old provision that is clearly limited in its application, addressing the apparel and the appearance of the accused person before
the court.  It does not provide, in my view, a power to the court to absent an accused person from his or her arraignment.  I am
informed by Mr Neil Mitchell, for the prosecution, that the Prosecution Division do not consent to the accused being absent from
his arraignment, and in any event, he submits that the subsection does not give the power to the Court as suggested by Mr McCoy.
 I agree. 7.  The second suggestion by Mr McCoy, in disposing of this case without the defendant’s attendance, is to arraign the defendant by
way of television link.  However, as rightly pointed out by Mr Mitchell, the provision for television link communication with the
court is only in relation to the taking of evidence from witnesses.  See sections 79H to 79L, the Live Television Link (Witnesses outside Hong Kong) Rules, and the Practice Direction 9.9.  It does not include the arraignment
of an accused.  8.  Accordingly, I am of the view that the two methods suggested by Mr McCoy for the arraignment of the defendant without his attendance
are not open to the Court. ",WALSH KENT ANDREW(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2246.html,"

LAM CHUNG WAI v. LAM HI WAY [2017] HKCFI 2249; HCAP 29/2015 (15 December 2017),"52.  In passing, I should make it clear that I leave open the questions of the plaintiff’s liability to pay rent or mesne profits to
the estate of Madam Lee for his occupation of Flat 19D, and the commencement date of such liability (if any), for future determination
should it become necessary to do so. 53.  Ms Lui submits that probate of the Will should not be granted to the plaintiff in view of the fact that he is caught in a position
of conflict arising from his occupation of Flat 19D without payment of rent.  As earlier mentioned, the plaintiff’s liability (if
any) to pay rent or mesne profits for his occupation of Flat 19D is an issue to be determined if it cannot be resolved by the parties
themselves.  It is a discrete issue which can be determined by the court separately without necessarily requiring the plaintiff to
be removed as executor of the Will. 54.  For the foregoing reasons, I pronounce for the force and validity of the Will in solemn form, remove the defendant as executor of
the Will, and grant probate of the Will to the Plaintiff as sole executor.  I shall hear the parties on the question of costs.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2249.html,"

CHINA CITIC BANK INTERNATIONAL LTD v. DURRANT SIMON PATRICK MICHAEL [2017] HKCFI 2250; HCMP 3196/2013 (15 December 2017),"12.  Under this section, a mortgagee is required to apply the proceeds of sale of a mortgaged property in the order mentioned in sub-paragraphs
(a) to (d) and pay the residue (if any) to “the person who, immediately before any sale or other dealing, was entitled to the mortgaged
land or authorized to give a receipt for the proceeds of the sale of that land”.  Such person would generally be the next subsequent
mortgagee or, if there is no subsequent mortgagee, the mortgagor (see Nield S and Da Roza AM, Hong Kong Conveyancing and Property Law Handbook (2007), paragraph CP54.10).  As mentioned above, there are a number of subsequent encumbrancers after the plaintiff.  The defendant
says that some of those subsequent encumbrancres have been paid off, and there is one encumbrancer (Mr Chan Wing Sun) who has agreed
to remove his encumbrance within 7 days of receipt of the sum of HK$250,000.  It is not necessary for the court in the present application
to determine who would be the next encumbrancer to whom the plaintiff should pay the residue of the proceeds of sale, because it
is the plaintiff’s duty to ascertain the person next entitled to the residue of the proceeds of sale.  There is also no evidence
to suggest that the plaintiff will not apply the proceeds of sale of the Property in accordance with Section 54 of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance.  I should mention that Mr Ip has, on behalf of the plaintiff, given an undertaking to the court to hand over the residue of the
proceeds of sale to the next person entitled thereto within 14 days after completion of the sale of the Property.  The defendant
has failed, in my view, to make out a case that he is entitled to be paid directly by the plaintiff 50% or more of the proceeds of
sale (after deduction of the outstanding amounts due under the subsisting encumbrances) within 24 hours of the date of completion. 13.  Lastly, I should mention that, in the defendant’s skeleton argument received by the court on 14 December 2017, the defendant seeks
some further relief, including injunction and vesting order, against the plaintiff.  However, such relief is not mentioned in the
Summons, and it does not appear to me that there is any proper or sufficient basis for such relief to be granted by the court. 14.  For the foregoing reasons, the Summons is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed.  The plaintiff’s undertaking
to the court should be recorded in the sealed order.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2250.html,"

"MOHAMMAD PALASH v. WILLIAM LAM, ESQ AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2255; HCAL 120/2017 (18 December 2017)","40.  The adjudicator did just that, there is no reason why he should not accept and consider the new evidence in the rehearing/de novo hearing; I see no procedural unfairness, impropriety nor prejudice.  I can see no reason why this decision means the adjudicator
has not maintained a high standard of fairness.  This ground has no merit. 41.  In fact, the legislation provides for a situation where an applicant can lodge a new or subsequent claim when there has been a significant
change in his circumstances since his previous claim was finally determined by the director; see S37ZO and S37ZP of the Immigration Ordinance Cap. 115. The legislation places stringent limits on subsequent claims but nevertheless provides for the possibility of a new claim.
The more appropriate course of action may have been for this applicant to have considered this course of action when he received
the new evidence. 42.  I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator.  Nor do I see any evidence of procedural unfairness
or a failure to adhere to a high standard of fairness.  The substantive decision did satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was
not Wednesbury unreasonable.  None of the grounds were arguable so as to satisfy the test in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Cheung & anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676.

was no truth to grounds 2 and 3. Ground 4 he called far‑fetched. As for ground 1, the failure of the duty lawyer scheme to find
merit in his appeal cannot be defined as a miscarriage of justice and the fact the applicant was unrepresented in his appeal has
not shown to be procedurally unfair. 27.  I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator either. Nor do I see any other evidence of procedural
unfairness nor a failure to adhere to a high standard of fairness. The substantive decision did satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test;

It is not necessary for me to decide whether paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Originating Summons relating to the liability issue
should be heard today, because one of the matters to be considered in respect of that issue is whether the plaintiff has waived certain
contractual requirement to be met for the defendant to be paid their fees, and Mr Chain accepts that the question of waiver entails
a consideration of the plaintiff’s state of knowledge which requires evidence to be adduced but no evidence has yet been filed
by the parties for the purpose of the Supplementary Originating Summons. 7.  In so far as paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Originating Summons relating to the interpretation issue is concerned, I am not minded
to split the Supplementary Originating Summons into two parts and dispose of paragraph 1 thereof only at this stage.  The defendant
could have issued the Supplementary Originating Summons shortly after the plaintiff issued its Originating Summons, but did not do
so until 14 December 2017.  No good explanation for the delay in issuing the Supplementary Originating Summons has been given.  There
is also not shown any urgency for a final determination of the interpretation issue[1] at this stage.  In such circumstances, I am unable to exercise my discretion to compress the usual procedural time table and allow

ACHIEVE GOAL HOLDINGS LTD v. ZHONG XIN ORE MATERIAL HOLDING CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 2379; HCA 1987/2005 (19 December 2017),"4.  Achieve Goal and Angola seeks discovery of an agreement between Ma Maogen and one Mr Zhang Xintien, dated 17 May 2011.  The relevance
is said to be this.  Clarigain’s witness, Madam Gao, referred to Zhang’s affirmation.  Clarigain does not intend to call Zhang
as a witness, but intends to adduce his affirmation by way of hearsay.  Under Section 49(2) of the Evidence Ordinance (Cap. 8), the court has to consider a number of factors before deciding whether to give weight to the hearsay evidence.  5.  Angola and Achieve Goal submits that the documents sought would be relevant to Section 49(2)(d) of the Evidence Ordinance, ie for challenging whether Zhang had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters.  6.  This discovery is, in my view, for a collateral purpose of attacking credibility, and, as submitted by Mr Wang, even this credibility
issue will not touch on the core issue of the case as to interest in the shares between Zhong Xin and Angola.  The agreement sought

I decline to re-grant an order.  Material non-disclosure is a serious breach of the duty of full and frank disclosure in applications
where the court relies on the applicant to draw attention to all material matters.  There is no explanation for the non-disclosure,
the plaintiff simply denying that there was no non-disclosure.  This will not do.  What made matters worse was that the plaintiff
is a repeat offender.  A Chan J held in §43 of his Decision in HCA 446/2015 that the material non-disclosure there was “indefensible”. 46.   I order that:","Bunker S

RE SHING PUI KEUNG [2017] HKCFI 2274; HCB 686/2017 (20 December 2017),"32.  For the petitioner, Mr Chan has made some valid criticisms of Shing’s case including an inconsistency in relation to the period
covered by the alleged agreement between Shing’s affirmation and his earlier solicitors’ letter.  Ultimately, however, this is
a question of fact and there is no evidence from Woo to deny the oral agreement, nor any explanation why no such evidence has been
adduced (although Woo has left the petitioner, there is no suggestion he cannot be found or is hostile).  Further, Ben So has also
made an affirmation stating he was present at the meeting and confirming Shing’s account.  Indeed, Ben So said that subsequently
he chased Woo many times on Shing’s behalf and Woo stated that the money would be released once the formal papers were ready. 
On the evidence before me I am unable to dismiss Shing’s case as lacking in substance for being incredible. 33.  Overall the evidence and arguments put forward on Shing’s behalf in my view passed the hurdle, even if not with flying colours.
 I do not consider that his claims are so lacking in substance as to permit the petitioner to obtain a bankruptcy order against him.
 After all, bankruptcy proceedings are summary in nature and intended for clear cases and even a cross-claim said to be “somewhat
shadowy” had been held to constitute a defence[1], although ultimately it is a question of applying the established principles to the facts of each case. 34.  For these reasons, the bankruptcy petition is dismissed. There will be an order nisi that the petitioner do pay Shing the costs of the petition.","Between 3 and 4 years of the Effective Date

In the aforesaid circumstances of this case, I do not consider that it is open to the defendant to rely on the issue of waiver for
the purpose of resisting the plaintiff’s application for injunction.  I am also not minded to permit further evidence and submissions
to be filed on the issue of waiver as proposed by Mr Chain towards the end of the hearing on 18 December 2018, for two reasons:- 26.  In all, I am of the view that the Approval Condition has not been satisfied such that there is clearly a bona fide dispute of the Alleged Debt on substantial grounds.  Having reached this conclusion, it is not necessary for me to consider the others
grounds raised by Mr Man on behalf of the plaintiff in support of the present application.  It would also not be appropriate for
me to express any view on the construction issue mentioned in paragraph 15(1) above, in view of the fact that it is an issue which

with costs to the plaintiff to be taxed on a party and party basis if not agreed.  I make a like order in respect of the costs of

Government Land which formed no part of the estate of the Deceased as identified in the Schedule of Property”[18]  Counsel also submitted that the power of an administrator derives from the grant of Letters of Administration, and that power was
confined to those set out in the Schedule of Property.  As such, it would be wrong in law for the Magistrate to find “a power of
management of the estate of the Deceased” means a power of management of something outside the said Schedule.  In my view, all
unleased land would not be listed in any kind of schedule of Property of the estate as it would not be lawful. 34.

(totaled 9.25 hours); $39,000 for professional work (totaled 9.75 hours); $27,600 for counsel fee and $200 for disbursement.  10.  I note that D6’s counsel has a standing of 4 years.  There are two fee earners from D6’s solicitors: one is Mr Ng (admitted
in 1993) and the other is a trainee solicitor and they charge a combined hourly rate of $4,000.  However, there are no breakdowns
as to how much time was spent by the solicitors and how much time by the trainee solicitor.  11.  In my assessment, the counsel fee is reasonable and the same can be said of the manual work and the disbursement.  However, the
fees claimed (for communications and professional work) by the fee-earners of D6’s solicitors are on the high side, bearing in
mind that counsel was briefed.  By a very broad brush approach, a global amount of $65,000 for D6’s costs would in my view be reasonable

the latter two claims fall apart, the “Interest Plea” cannot have a life of its own.  59.  Based on the above discussions, all the claims as contained in the SOC and as identified in the Table of Claims are struck out.
  The remaining paragraphs of the SOC including the prayers which are not relied upon as a claim must also go.  The result is that
the SOC is struck out in its entirety. 60.  In view of the result, I make an order nisi that Harbour Front should pay the costs of the defendants, to be taxed if not agreed.","•

ALE THAK PRASAD v. TSANG CHIN KEUNG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 2319; HCPI 579/2012 (29 December 2017),"43.  The question of possible “symptoms magnification” or “malingering” is inevitably raised in many of these claims.  As such, one should be careful in allowing another layer of expert evidence like such
neuropsychological tests which would only increase the costs further.  I am not, of course, excluding the possibility that there
may be special circumstances when such neuropsychological tests can be justified, but the court will need to hear convincing reasons
as to why, under those circumstances, the “tried-and-tested” system in trial proceedings is inadequate to answer this question
and that the extra time and costs needed is justifiable. 44.  I would accordingly direct that no leave be granted to the plaintiff to adduce the neuropsychological test report by Dr. Suzanne
Meenan and award cost of and occasioned by the application be to the defendant with certificate to counsel. 45.  As to whether I should allow Legal Aid taxation for the plaintiff’s own costs, I have raised my concerns in paragraphs 11 to 17
of this decision.  I would therefore direct that a copy of this decision be released to the Director of Legal Aid and for them to
reply to the court with any comments if needed within 28 days.  Mr. Burke may further write to this court to make any further submissions

The Administrator accused the Pangs of adopting a delaying tactic by resisting this separate trial application and by seeking unnecessarily

dated 7 November 2016 executed by the plaintiff, the defendants, Sarah Chin, Vivian Chin, and Chin Ngai Lan. 6.   The parties to the Deed of Settlement also agree that letters of administration of the estate of the Deceased should be granted

and assets listed in the proposed annexes to the order that I will make need to be dealt with in accordance with section 62, this will involve: 7.  One issue which I considered with Mr Tang of Linklaters, who appeared for the applicant, was how the matter would proceed in the
event that a person were to come forward and claim any of the securities. It seems to me that the position would, depending on the
precise time that this occurred, be dealt with as follows: if, as is proposed, the applicant is put into voluntary liquidation, then
any claim can be made to the liquidator and adjudicated by him; if, by the time a claimant came forward, the applicant had been dissolved,
it would be necessary for an application to be made to the court for the restoration of the company to the Register and the re-appointment

HKSAR v. LAU CHEUNG FAI [2018] HKCFI 602; HCCC 367/2015 (4 January 2018),"13.  As I have already mentioned, the two defence psychiatrists have submitted further reports in which they submit that the defendant
is unfit to be tried.  The government psychiatrist has now submitted his further report in which he submits the defendant is fit
to be tried.  The three psychiatrists in their previous reports provided medical opinions addressing the issue of diminished responsibility.
 They were divided on this issue on similar lines as they are now, and if it is determined that the defendant is fit to be tried,
the trial jury will be required to consider the differences in the medical opinions when addressing the ingredients of diminished
responsibility.  On what I have been provided, the section 75 application will require the jury to consider the different medical opinions between the defence doctors and the prosecution doctor
which will arise again if the case proceeds to trial when dealing with the issue of diminished responsibility.  14.  It has now been urged upon me by Mr Arthur, to which Mr Richmond is in agreement, that the question of fitness to be tried be dealt
with by the empanelled jury and that if they decide that the defendant is fit to be tried, then the trial should proceed before a
new jury.  If the empanelled jury decide that he is unfit to be tried, then they can deal with the determination whether he did the
acts as charged which appear not to be in dispute. 15.  On the basis of the position now taken by the parties and for the reasons mentioned above, the issue to be determined pursuant to
section 75 will be dealt with by the empanelled jury.  They will accordingly be required to take an oath or affirmation to determine whether
the defendant is fit to be tried and the charge to them will be that upon hearing the evidence, including the evidence that they
have heard so far, whether the defendant is under a disability so that he is not fit to be tried or not under a disability so that
he is fit to be tried.  Section 75(4)(b) gives the court the discretion to have the issue determined by the empanelled jury.  But in my view, the consequences of doing so
will mean in the circumstances of this case, if the jury decides the defendant is fit to be tried, then the trial on the general
issue will be before a new jury empanelled for that purpose. ",Date of Ruling: 4 January 2018(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/602.html,"

the MC members were essentially attacked on the propriety of their decision; their competence in arriving at that decision; their
motive of currying favours with owners; and their lack of transparency.  Though not considered unserious, the defamatory imputations
were not of very serious categories.  The Poster was published in such a manner that a substantial number of persons were likely
to have read its contents.  The defendants were defamed collectively.  Although each may have slightly different personal reputation,
I do not see sufficient degree of difference that justifies a disparity in treatment.  I also take into account the publication of
the Letter in reply to the attacks and its probable effect of partially restoring the reputation of the MC members or at least putting
such attacks to doubts.  In all the circumstances of this case, I award general damages in the sum of HK$80,000 to each of the 1st to 8th and 10th defendants.

ZHANG HONG LI AND OTHERS v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 34; HCCL 2/2011 (9 January 2018),"18.  Even though the summons for the stay had been refixed to be heard many months later on 6 December 2017, nobody expected the appeal
to be listed to be heard so early.  The idea of proceeding with the quantum exercise before the Court of Appeal heard the appeal
was sensible because if an appeal was also going to be lodged against my assessment on quantum, the Court of Appeal could deal with
it at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal.  However, given the further steps that needed to be taken, as set out
in §15(a) above, and given the state of the court’s diary, it was not possible, between 6 December 2017 and 8 May 2018, to complete
the quantum exercise in sufficient time to enable an appeal to be lodged against my assessment of quantum and to be dealt with by
the Court of Appeal at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal. 19.  For these reasons, I exercised my discretion to make the directions set out in §15 above.  Given the current state of affairs,
the road map provided by these directions is a pragmatic solution which enables the 3rd and 4th plaintiffs to refix the assessment of quantum expeditiously in the event that the 2nd and 4th defendants’ appeal is dismissed. 20.  Parties ought not to be granted the indulgence of fixing hearing dates in consultation with counsels’ diaries in cases which ought
to be dealt with expeditiously.",(Mohan Bharwaney)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/34.html,"

use by the petitioner, is in a case of this sort sufficient to protect the interests of the placees, and that nothing of materially
greater benefit is likely to be achieved in terms of protecting those interests by introducing into this application an additional
and possibly time‑consuming and expensive stage, namely, notifying the various placees of the application, explaining to them what
it involves, and giving them the opportunity to address the court. 17.  As I understand it, subject to the qualification to which I have already referred, none of the parties object to the language of
the order agreed by the petitioner and Cinda in the letter which I have quoted from.  I will therefore make an order in those terms

MUHAMMAD AZAM v. DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THETORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 4; HCAL 161/2017 (11 January 2018),"69.  On the hearing date, I refused an application to adjourn for the purpose of the applicant to obtain and hear the audio tape of the
appeal hearing.  No specific reason could be given for that purpose and I found the objective was a fishing exercise therefore, I
refused the application.  After hearing submissions for leave I adjourned and reserved my decision.  Three weeks later, solicitors
for the applicant filed a further ex parte summons applying for leave to re-amend the Form 86 and add a further ground, applying for leave to file further evidence by way of
another affirmation and applying for leave to file a supplemental submission attaching an unofficial uncertified transcript of the
audio recording of the oral appeal hearing. 70.  It would generally require an exceptional case before the court is prepared to accede to consider additional amendments and evidence
after it has adjourned to consider its decision, see Charlesworth v Relay Roads Ltd & Others [1999] EWHC 829;  [2000] 1 WLR 230.  I did consider the additional submissions and amendment; I saw no merit in the additional ground and the transcript was of minimal
assistance to the claimant.  From the transcript, the adjudicator was accused of misstating the applicant’s evidence, considering
irrelevant matters and acting unfairly which were sweeping accusations I disagreed with.  I did not grant leave to further amend
the Form 86, produce a further affirmation or additional evidence or submissions. 71.  After a careful examination of the submissions I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator.
 I see no evidence of procedural unfairness nor a failure to adhere to a high standard of fairness.  The substantive decision did
satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was not Wednesbury unreasonable.  None of the grounds put forth by the applicant were arguable
so as to satisfy the test in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Chan & anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676 paras 14-17. In my judgement, the applicant’s claim is not reasonably arguable.  There is no realistic prospect of success and

the appellant had been told of the suspected bribery offence he was involved as the person in charge of a company for offering bribe
to Chilli and another, who were employees of another company.  He knew ICAC was going to search his home for evidence relevant to
the alleged offence.  He knew the investigations would continue and he had to go to the ICAC office.  He asked for permission to
go to the bathroom for him to change, but he took the opportunity to send the messages, in breach of the condition that he could
only use the iPhone to contact his lawyer.  The messages were then immediately deleted.  It was obvious that he did not want the
ICAC officers to discover them. 81.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s conduct had a tendency, and was intended, to pervert the course of

HKSAR v. RANJIT SINGH [2018] HKCFI 57; HCMA 538/2017 (11 January 2018),"7.  The appellant, representing himself in the appeal, had put forward several grounds of appeal.  At first he alleged that the evidence
showed that the identity card was about a hundred feet away from him.  However, at page 33 of the Appeal Bundle, at Line K in the
submission of the Defence counsel, he did mention that the ID card according to PW1 had fallen about a metre away and according to
PW2 was one and a half metres away from the appellant’s leg, so it was not really as the appellant said a hundred feet away. However,
the appellant further submitted that if he was taking out his Form 8, how could he have thrown away the identity card.  And he questioned
why the CCTV camera tape was not produced and there was no evidence that his fingerprints were found on the identity card. 8.  As I have explained to the appellant, this court is an appeal against conviction, only examines the evidence which was before the
learned magistrate, and if as the learned magistrate had made a proper assessment of the evidence before him and whether the evidence
before him was sufficient to ground the conviction. 9.  In this case, as Mr Daryanani pointed out that the learned magistrate said this is a “one‑on‑one” case in that PW1 alleged
that the identity card was taken out of the appellant’s back pocket together with the Form 8 and the appellant asserted in cross‑examination
that it was not his.  The learned magistrate was fully aware of the situation and after having properly assessed the evidence and
concluded that PW1 was an honest and reliable witness and therefore convicted the appellant.  I cannot see any grounds for interfering
with the learned magistrate’s conviction, so the appeal against conviction is dismissed.",(E Toh)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/57.html,"

The further and better particulars sought by the Plaintiff are as follows:- 38.  I consider that the Plaintiff is entitled to the particulars sought.  I am unable to accept Mr Fung’s submissions that those particulars
relate to “matters of evidence”, or are “wholly unnecessary for the fair disposal of this action or for saving costs”.  It
seems to me that the requests ask for particulars of fact which go directly to the Defendant’s allegation that “GE,Mr.Lo,variousoftheChildren,andthePlaintiff”
were “important” customers of the HSBC Group, and would explain why the Original Trustee and the Defendant would be prepared
to accept a fixed percentage fee for acting as trustee of the Trust which, according to the Plaintiff, is “relatively insubstantial
compared with the value of the Trust Fund”. 39.  For the foregoing reasons, I order the Defendant to give the particular sought by the Plaintiff referred to in paragraph 37 above
within 14 days of the date of the order herein.  On the issue of costs, most of the time at the hearing on 21 December 2017 was spent
on the first set of requests, which the Defendant has successfully resisted.  Overall, I consider that a fair order to make would
be that the Defendant shall have 80% of the costs of the application, to be taxed if not agreed, and I so order.  In view of the
fact that the application relates only to a matter of particulars which seems to me to be relatively straight forward, I am not inclined

"HKSAR v. CHAN HEI CHUN, JOSEPH [2018] HKCFI 61; HCCC 193/2017 (12 January 2018)","9.  Count 1 concerns a quantity of Ice of 12g. Count 2 is simple possession of a small quantity of Ice which the prosecution has accepted
was for the defendant’s own consumption.  The starting point tariff as provided by HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 for the quantity of Ice in Count 1 is 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.  The range of sentence for simple possession in the circumstances
of this case is 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment.  See HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] HKCA 61; [2001] 1 HKC 261.  The defendant has had a serious drug addiction and on his own admission, he had been consuming Ice since 2008.  10.  As the defendant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, he is entitled to a one-third discount to his sentences.  See HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2015] HKCFI 1752; [2016] 1 HKLRD 1.  Accordingly, the starting points will be reduced on Count 1 from 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment to 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment, and on Count 2 from 9 months’ imprisonment to 6 months’ imprisonment.  11.  I bear in mind that if the quantity of drugs in the possession count had been added to the quantity of drugs in the trafficking
count, the starting point would have made very little difference to the resultant sentence.  To illustrate this point, on an arithmetic
calculation, the quantity of 12 g would result in a starting point of 85.6 months’ imprisonment, and 12.14 g would result in a
starting point of 85.72 months’ imprisonment.  For this reason, as well as bearing in mind the totality principle, I will order
that the sentences on the two counts be served concurrently.  Accordingly, the defendant will serve a sentence of 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/61.html,"

for Mr A Tang). I am not persuaded a conference with counsel would be necessary at all. All that was required prior to the Hearing
as being necessary or proper was for junior counsel to settle Ng’s affirmations, and with proper instructions it would not have
required any conference whether with solicitors alone or with clients as well. It was the nuanced presentation of factual information
in solicitors’ drafts that required counsel’s skilled input, and it was not the function of counsel to gather primary instructions
during conference when costs were claimed for 2 fee-earners for attendance on client and preparation of documents. In particular,
I do not see any need for counsel to settle the summons and GR’s affirmation which was brief and well within the scope of work
and ability of DC/GR. In any event, I do not see any need, on party and party basis, to involve leading counsel for settling affirmation/affidavit. 31.  Taking into account all of the above matters, and upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary
and its costs reasonable” on the sensible standard of necessity as explained by the Court of Appeal, Ng’s/Daughter’s total
costs on their Statement of Costs are assessed at HK$270,000.  Although I have explained in paragraph 7 above why written submissions
on summary assessment of costs should not be considered, having cast a quick eye over the contents of such submissions, I find that
even if I were to take them into account, they would not have swayed me from the above analysis and outcome. 32.  I therefore order that Chen shall pay Ng/Daughter costs in the sum of HK$270,000.",Date of Handing Down Decision (paper disposal): 15 January 2018(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/41.html,"

HONIP CREDIT LTD v. TANG WING HONG AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 56; HCMP 393/2017 (15 January 2018),"12.  In respect of the Inaccuracy Defence, the defendants refer to the repayments made before the Loan Agreement made on 13 October 2016
and contend that the plaintiff has made mistakes in the calculation of the outstanding amounts under the previous loan agreements.
 To succeed in this defence, the defendants have to adduce sufficient evidence to show that there is a triable issue over whether
the previous loans were part and parcel of the Loan Agreement to defeat the MLO.  However, there is none. 13.  It remains for me to say that Mr Chau confirmed to me, sensibly, that he did not run any defence of misrepresentation.  There being
no evidence suggesting any concealment of the correct figures from the defendants at the time of the Loan Agreement, there is no
reason why the 1st defendant would not have known how much he had borrowed and repaid.  Any attempt to run the defence of misrepresentation would be
bound to fail. 14.  In conclusion, the defendants having raised no triable defence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought
under the Originating Summons.  I shall hear submissions on the terms of the Order I am to make and submissions on costs.",Date of Handing Down of Decision: 15 January 2018(Gary C C Lam),Master of the High Court,/2018/56.html,"

be fully covered by the value of the property mortgaged. 7.  In these circumstances, this court is not satisfied that there are legally valid grounds in opposition to the Petition.  If so,
a bankruptcy order should be made. 8.  There shall be a usual bankruptcy order against Mr Cheng Tun Sang and an order nisi that the costs of the Petition, including all costs previously reserved, if any, be to the Petitioning Creditor, to be taxed if not

There is some dispute between the parties as to whether the Petitioner carried on the business of a money lender within the meaning
of MLO.  However, had the Company discharged its duty in registering the Charge, whether the Petitioner was a money lender is very
much a non-issue. 37.  There is also some weight in the Petitioner’s argument that the shares subscription agreement, the shares allotment and the Gemini
Charger were not genuine transactions.  In my judgment, it is not necessary for me to resolve such issue for the purpose of the present
application.  The reasons given by me earlier are already more than sufficient for the court to exercise the discretion in granting
the extension order. 38.  I therefore make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the Petitioner’s summons dated 19 July 2017.  I also make an order nisi that the costs of the said summons be paid by the opposing Contributory to the Petitioner which shall be made absolute 14 days after

mortgagee should be informed about the proposed order for sale and be given the opportunity to make representation if necessary. 11.  In such case, I would adjourn the application for the order for sale pending notification be given to the first mortgagee and the

Mr Wong has raised a question of non-disclosure by the plaintiff at the hearing before Lok J on 25 August 2017.  Mr Wong says that
the court should have been, but was not, told that there was an ancestral hall and that the two main routes to the hall would be
blocked.  In response, Miss Wong, who appears for the plaintiff, has pointed out that on 25 August, the 2nd defendant was represented both by counsel and solicitors, and his counsel indeed addressed the court.  It is plain to me that the
2nd defendant would have known about the ancestral hall and certainly about the routes to that hall on 25 August, if not at an earlier
time, and would have been able to instruct his counsel as to these matters.  The fact that at some later stage one of the pathways
was gated is, in my view, neither here nor there.  I find that there is no case of material non-disclosure here. 14.  In all these circumstances, the order of Lok J dated 25 August 2017 will continue until trial or further order, but subject to an
amendment, that is, I think, sensibly proposed by Miss Wong, and that is to identify with precision the fact that the small house

巨展皮具香港有限公司 v. 上海兄弟海運有限公司 AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 53; HCA 2731/2016 (17 January 2018),"27.  I am satisfied that if the plaintiff can prove the pleaded facts after a trial, it would be entitled to the other relief sought based on the concept of constructive trust.  The two Sums were obtained
by fraud.  When property is obtained by fraud, equity imposes a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient so that the property
is recoverable and traceable in equity: Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council [1996] UKHL 12;  [1996] AC 669, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 716C–D, applied by Sakhrani J in Michael Chen Kang Huang v Peter Lit Ma [2009] HKCFI 552; [2009] 6 HKC 191 at 199I–200C, and by Recorder Lisa Wong SC (as she then was) in Mesirow Financial Administrative Corporation v Best Link Industrial Co Limited HCMP 1846/2015, 25 January 2016, at paragraph 33. 28.  But there has not been any trial in this case.  And a declaration is being sought.  I need to bear in mind the rules of practice
set out in paragraphs 12 and 13 above and decide how I should exercise my discretion. I take into account the important fact that
the plaintiff was the victim of two incidents of fraud.  Little is known about the defendants, including whether they have any other
creditors.  The plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaration and equitable relief sought, so as to avert any need for itto race
against other creditors.  Fairness justifies it.  I note that declaratory relief was also granted in the absence of the defendants
in a number of earlier cases in which the claimants were victims of fraud or email fraud: Mesirow (supra), Guaranty Bank and Trust Co v Zzzik Inc Limited HCA 1139/2016, 18 July 2016 and Halliburton BV Merkezi Hollanda Ankara Merkez Turkiye Subesi v Sheng Yi (HK) Trade Co Ltd & Ors HCA 1627/2016, 24 January 2017.  I am satisfied that the facts of the present case are such that I should exercise my discretion
in favor of granting the declaratory and related equitable relief sought. 29.  For the above reasons, I order that judgment in terms of the present summons be entered against the defendants, together with costs
of the action and this application.","佛山明盛傢俱有限公司

CHEUNG PING SUM v. WONG CHI HANG [2018] HKCFI 70; HCA 289/2017 (17 January 2018),"44.  I find that this limb of the complaint also fails. 45.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the defendant’s application.  Imake an order nisi that the plaintiff should have the costs of this application.  46.  Given the common genesis of the Estate Action and this action,and given, as I have found, the similarity in the nature of some of
the factualissues involved, it makes perfect sense that the two actions be consolidated for hearing. It is further my view that disputes
of such nature between family members should be dealt with expeditiously so that hopefully the riftcan be healed as soon as possible.
 In the course of the hearing, I indicated to counsel that should I dismiss the application, I might consider making case management
directions on consolidation and seek the parties’ submissions in that regard. However, on further consideration, given the different
types of consolidation that can be ordered, and to avoid further unnecessary costs, I have decided not to do so at this stage.  I
however urgeparties to come together and agree upon a set of directions on consolidation, so that this action can be disposed of
together with (or immediately after) the Estate Action. ","WONG CHI HANG (黃志恒)

HKSAR v. INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI [2018] HKCFI 79; [2018] 3 HKC 394; HCCC 318/2017 (17 January 2018),"36.  Applying those principles to the present case, there has been a breach of the privacy rights of the accused.  That breach involves
the examination of information held on the mobile phone of the accused.  To the extent that the degree of privacy to be expected
in circumstances is relevant I would consider that generally speaking there is an expectation of a high degree of privacy in relation
to the contents of a modern mobile phone.  I respectfully adopt the articulation of the issues in connection with this to beseen
in Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner of Police (above).  In my judgement,the reception into evidence of this material would not jeopardise a fair trial ofthe accused and is, indeed,
conducive to a fair trial.  I also take into account the issue of whether the examination of the mobile phone is reconcilable with
the clear privacy rights of the accused.  This, so it seems to me, is a difficult matter but to the extent that both Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner of Police (above) and RvYuYem-kin(above) recognise that in the absence of a judicial warrant authorising the examination of the mobile phone that circumstances of
urgency might be reconcilable with the clear need to protect the privacy rights of the accused it seems to me that an examination
a few hours later although not characterisable as urgent was not an egregious violation of those rights.  However, what is of the
greatest importance in the exercise of the discretion vested in the court is the third consideration outlined by Bokhary PJ in HKSARv MuhammadRiazKhan (above).  He held that it was appropriate to consider whether it appears unlikely to encourage any future breaches of that, those
or other rights.  It is important to note that Bokhary PJ indicated that this consideration had to take into account up-to-date experience. 37.  The decision of this Court in Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner ofPolice (above) was something of a sea change in the approach of the courts two important practical matters for law enforcement agencies.
 In a similar vein, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Keen Lloyd Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Customs and Excise [2016] HKCA 151; [2016] 2 HKLRD 1372, 5 HKC 508 in relation to circumstances in which warrants could go “stale” was also such a sea change.  While it is the court
was declaring the law as it existed rather than as it was to be from the time of the decision, it is fair to say that law enforcement
agencies did not anticipate these declarations and, in good faith, had a different view of the law which did not take into account
the implied limitations on the powers of all enforcement agencies which have arisen from those decisions.  It would not have surprised
me in the least to learn that both developments were not anticipated by law enforcement agencies. The conduct of the officers of
the Customs and Excise Service which is impugned in the present case predated the decision in Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner of Police (above) by about 6 months.  Indeed, I venture to suggest that had these events occurred the day before that decision the officers
would have taken exactly the same approach. As has already been indicated, counsel for the accused has taken the entirely reasonable
and realistic position that no bad faith is to be imputed to the officers.  In my judgement, I do not think this conduct in ignorance
of the law as it was subsequently declared to be is likely to be repeated.  There is also to be considered the importance of detecting
and punishing serious criminal conduct.  It is no understatement to characterise the conduct in the present case alleged against
the accused as serious criminal conduct.  The material on the mobile phone, when taken together with other proved circumstances and
conduct in the case provides a circumstantial case which is capable of proving that the accused knew that there were dangerous drugs
on the parcel that she received.  The evidence is of great importance in that regard and those two circumstances are highly relevant
to the exercise of discretion reposed in the court in the circumstances. Fortunately, I do not have to consider a problem which may
arise in cases which arise after the advent of the decision in Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner of Police (above).  It was suggested in argument that in serious cases there is a substantial risk that law enforcement agencies might make
the judgement that the case is sufficiently serious that they do not have to comply with the appropriate interpretations of the law
ofsearch and seizure and that there might therefore arise a culture of impunity.  Implicit in the argument in this case was that
the court should declare the evidence to be inadmissible in the exercise of its discretion to make plain that his rights must be
respected.  As I say, this does not arise in the present case but it may be an issue that courts have to grapple with in the future. 38.  In my judgement, I am of the view that there was a breach of the privacy rights of the accused.  That was a substantial breach of
those rights and was done in circumstances in which there was a clearly justified expectation of privacy.  Nevertheless, the breach
was not one undertaken in bad faith in the sense that there is no suggestion that the relevant officers thought that their conduct
was inconsistent with the provisions of the Customs and Excise Service Ordinance as they understood it.  The breach of the rights of the accused took place at a time could not be characterised as exigent circumstances
in the sense that this is articulated in Sham Wing Kan v Commissioner of Police (above).  Although the obtaining of a warrantmight have been something of a challenge, I do not think that it could be said that
the obtaining of the relevant search warrant was impracticable.  The problem in this case was that, in good faith, the officers did
not think that they needed one.  The conduct is serious and there is a high public interest in the detection and punishment of crimes
such as that which is the subject of the present indictment.  Further, I do not think that in the circumstances apply in the instant
case that exercising a discretion in favour of the reception into evidence of the product of the search of the mobile phone is likely
to encourage future breaches of the law of search and seizure as it is now to be.  It is for those reasons that I exercise my discretion
in favour of ordering that the evidence be admitted.","INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI

HKSAR v. INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI [2018] HKCFI 80; [2018] 3 HKC 394; HCCC 318/2017 (17 January 2018),"14.  Against that standard, in my judgement, a jury could draw the inferences that I have outlined above.  The evidence is therefore,
in my judgement, relevant.  It is capable of being a basis upon which a jury could find that the accused had the relevant state of
mind required for the proof of the offence on the indictment. 15.  The second issue is whether the evidence is more prejudicial than probative.  It is plainly probative when taken together with the
other evidence to which I have made reference.  The only remaining issue is whether it is so prejudicial as to place in jeopardy
the fair trial of the accused.  In Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7;  (1995) 182 CLR 461, in the High Court of Australia, McHugh J made the point that: “The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue,
the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial.”  In determining the threat to the fairness of the trial, the issue is whether,
by reason of the reception of this evidence, the jury might somehow be divertedfrom the real issue, or that there is a substantial
risk that the jury might misusethe evidence to the prejudice of the accused.  It would be necessary for there to be a careful direction
on the use (and possible misuse) of circumstantial evidence.  In my judgement, if such a direction is given in the context of a direction
based on WinnieLov HKSAR (above), the fair trial of the accused is not put in jeopardy. 16.  It follows that I decline to exclude the evidence on the basis that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative
value.  I should add that this ruling, which occurs about one third of the way through the prosecution case, and, if the evidence
turns out differently to that which is anticipated, there might be a case which would justify revisiting this objection and my ruling.
 Part of the reason for this is although the material on the mobile phone is not susceptible of changing, part of my reason for concluding
that the impugned evidence is admissible upon the basis that it is relevant and that the prejudicial effect of that evidence is outweighed
by its probative value, that has been done in the context of not only the product of the mobile phone but also the other evidence
in the case.","INDRA AGUS SETIAWATI

LAM WAI LING MAYME v. HUTCHISON TELECOMMUNICATIONS (HONG KONG) LTD [2018] HKCFI 92; [2018] 1 HKC 394; HCPI 461/2015 (17 January 2018),"24.  Order 22, r.10(2) provides that if there is subsisting an application to withdraw a sanctioned payment, the sanctioned payment may
not be accepted unless the Court grants leave to accept it.  Order 22, r.10(3) provides that if the Court dismisses an application
to withdraw, it may by order specify the period within which the sanctioned payment may be accepted.  The latter rule caters for
the situation where the plaintiff has not filed a notice of acceptance after an application has been made to withdraw the sanctioned
payment. The latter rule does not cover the present situation where the application to withdraw the sanctioned payment is followed
by a notice of acceptance, filed within the prescribed time, of the sanctioned payment.  After I had allowed the appeal and made
the orders set out in §4 above, I requested the parties to file further written submissions on the orders that I should make in
this case to enable the plaintiff to accept the sanctioned payment and the orders that I should make in relation to the interest
that has accrued on the sanctioned payment. 25.  I have considered the written submissions filed by the plaintiff. Although it was based on the UK rules, I have found the decision
of the UK Court of Appeal in John Joseph Flynn v. Tracey Scougall [2004]EWCA Civ 873,that was referred to by the plaintiff, to be of some assistance. In that case, the defendant had made a payment into court and subsequently received an expert’s report that was favourable to the
defence case. They then applied to diminish the amount they had paid into court. After receiving notice of the defendant’s application,
the plaintiff gave notice on 25 March 2003, within the prescribed time, accepting the payment in.  The Court of Appeal upheld the
judge’s decision to dismiss the defendant’s application to diminish the amount of the payment in and made orders that enabled
the plaintiff to receive the total amount of the original payment that had been made into court, together with interest accruing
on that amount from 25 March 2003.  In doing so, the Court of Appeal validated the notice of acceptance of payment in that had been
served within the prescribed time. 26.  The defendant elected not to file written submissions and the parties, very sensibly, filed a consent summons agreeing terms, including
the term that interest accrued on the sum of $63,000 after 25 November 2016 be paid to the plaintiff.  I make an order in terms of
the consent summons, as amended by me, as follows:",Date of Reasons for Decision: 17 January 2018(Mohan Bharwaney),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/92.html,"

PAN SHI LIANG v. HARSEN INDUSTRIES LTD [2018] HKCFI 211; HCMP 1917/2017 (17 January 2018),"4.  The application came before me in November last years.  Although both the Company and Mr Wong had been given notice, no one appeared
at that hearing in opposition.  As a result of the questions I raised, however, the hearing was adjourned to today.  Those questions
have since been addressed, to my satisfaction, in the 3rd affirmation of Mr Pan and in the supplemental skeleton of Mr Leung who has appeared for Mr Pan.  Neither the Company nor Mr Wong
has appeared today to oppose the application.  5.  Since the matter is going forward and no opposing argument has been advanced, I will not go into the substantive claims in detail,
except to say that I accept Mr Leung’s submission, for the reasons he has given, that there are serious issues to be tried, which
is not a very high threshold, and that it appears prima facie to be in the interests of the Company that leave be granted given the remedies claimed are primarily damages and account for profits
which, if granted, would enure to the benefit of the Company.  I therefore grant leave for a statutory derivative action to be brought
and make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the originating summons. 6.  As for costs, I think the applicant should have the costs of the application, but I am minded to order that he be indemnified as
to 75% of the costs of the application by the Company because of certain duplication and wastage of costs having regard to the need
for two hearings, which cannot all be laid at the door of the Company.  So far as the costs of the derivative action are concerned,
I will order that they be paid by the Company out of its assets up to the exchange of lists of documents by way of discovery.  So
far as any further costs of the derivative action are concerned, paragraph 3 of the originating summons is adjourned sine die

he is under the duty to provide an account if so directed under the Order, and of course, pursuant to section 56 of the PAO.  Costs of preparation and furnishing of the account should no doubt come from the estate, and whether Mr Poon should
be ordered to pay the costs of this application is another matter.  Lastly, Mr Lau submits that there are practical difficulties
with the preparation of true, perfect and final accounts at this stage because of some complications.  9.  I am not in a position to assess the difficulties and the complexity of the preparation of the accounts, but it should not provide
a reason for an administrator not to provide an account, and the account, as fairly accepted by Mr Boey, counsel for Ms Tang, needs
not to be final.  All that Ms Tang wishes is the compliance of the duty of Mr Poon under section 56, and I see no reason why Mr Poon can escape such a duty.  10.  In the premises, I allow Ms Tang’s application and I would make an order that Mr Poon should make an affirmation exhibiting a
true and perfect inventory and account of the moveable and immoveable property of the estate of the Deceased pursuant to section 56 of the PAO and file the same to court within 35 days from today.  I will make no order as to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the originating

M v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD/ NON REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 24; [2018] 3 HKC 497; HCAL 155/2017 (19 January 2018),"28.  I agreed with Mr Wong that the tone and approach in the correspondence and hearing did not demonstrate the adjudicator was considering
the applicant’s well-being and opportunity to make representations on his own behalf in light of the well‑documented medical
condition he was suffering from.  If the tribunal maintained high standards of fairness and the application to adjourn had been considered
fairly then the application to adjourn, reasons offered and the numerous initial medical reports should have been enough to allow
the adjournment.  The assurance the adjournment was only to be until March 2016 plus the fact the Director of Immigration did not
object to it should have been enough to allow the adjournment. It was only fair to the applicant, on what was presented to the adjudicator
to allow the adjournment. I found merit in ground 1 and therefore quashed the decision of the TCAB dated 6 January 2017.  That hearing
should have been adjourned, it should not have proceeded that day in the absence of the applicant and been determined 13 months later. 29.  In light of my finding above I need not go into the merits of grounds 2 and 3.  If I did, there may also be merit in Mr Wong’s
submission that the adjudicator had failed to consider and/or analyse and/or understand the basis of the applicant’s claim being
a fear of persecution because of political opinions expressed.  There may be merit in Mr Wong’s submission that the adjudicator
mistakenly believes that the test under the persecution risk is virtually the same as under BOR 3.  As success with ground 1 will
suffice for the applicant’s purposes I do not intend to further analyse the decision. 30.  I made the following orders on 11 December 2017;",(Amanda Woodcock),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/24.html,"

be activated.  The activation did not offend the totality principle. 20.  Mr Daryanani, for the respondent, fairly made enquiries with the Director of Immigration to find out if there was any previous administrative
detention of the appellant for the court to consider if any such period should be taken into consideration.  The Immigration Department
has informed the respondent that the appellant has not spent any period of time in administrative detention. 21.  The sentence is neither manifestly excessive, nor wrong in principle. The appeal against sentence is therefore dismissed.","HOSSAIN ABIR

CCM EARTH LTD AND OTHERS v. ALFA GCM LTD [2018] HKCFI 85; HCA 1210/2016 (19 January 2018),"44.  On the other hand, Mr Yeung for the defendant submitted that the defendant could only pay into court the sum of HK$100,000.00. 
However, the defendant has not made full and frank disclosure of its financial resources in evidence, which would be required if
the defendant were to rely on a limitation of its financial means to pay (see HKCP (2018) Vol 1 §13/9/15, citing M V Yorke Motors v Edwards [1982] 1 WLR 444and Law Kwok Hung v Tse Ping Man & Anr [1999] HKCFI 320; [1999] 4 HKC 397 at 407F-I).   45.  Having taken all these matters into account, including the size of the Investment Sum and the defendant’s conduct in these proceedings,
I have come to the view that the defendant should be required to pay into court the sum of HK$1,000,000.00 within 28 days from today
as a condition for having the default judgment set aside. 46.  Accordingly, the order I make is that:-","ALFA GCM LIMITED

ARJOWIGGINS HKK2 LTD v. SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LTD [2018] HKCFI 93; HCCT 53/2015 (19 January 2018),"34.  If, as the Respondent submitted, there is any right on its part to serve expert evidence in reply, I consider that it is also incumbent
on the Respondent, at the time when it sought directions for filing evidence for the Summons, not only to highlight to the Court
and to the Claimant that it would be serving expert evidence, but also to confer with the Claimant and to agree on a timetable for
the experts to discuss the expert evidence to be addressed, and to identify areas of agreement and disagreement in good time before
the scheduled hearing of the Summons, to be of assistance to the Court.  Having failed so to do, it lies ill in its mouth to complain
of not being given the opportunity to adduce further expert evidence. 35.  In any event, and as a matter of caution, I have considered the further expert evidence sought to be produced and relied upon by
the Respondent.  Suffices it to say that it serves little purpose other than to confirm that the experts do not agree on the nature
of and procedures for derivative actions under PRC law.  As indicated in the earlier part of this Decision, the different views of
the experts on the issues they address under the relevant provisions of the PRC law have little impact on the outcome of the application
for the injunction, which I have granted. 36.  Since the application for leave to adduce expert evidence is too late in time, it is dismissed, with costs to the Claimant.","SHANDONG CHENMING PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED

LEONG WING SUM v. NG KAI MAN [2018] HKCFI 114; HCA 51/2018 (19 January 2018),"8.  On the other hand, as I informed Mr Lam at the hearing, I consider that the status quo ought to be maintained pending the substantive hearing of the Summons by imposing an interim, prohibitory, injunction to restrain
the Defendant from carrying out any further works on the site.  Mr Lam fairly accepted that the balance of convenience lied in favour
of maintaining the status quo.  Mr Lam also informed the court that should the court be minded to grant such injunction, the Defendant would be willing to offer
an undertaking to the same effect in lieu of an injunction being imposed by the court, although his primary position was that no
interim injunction should be granted. 9.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the parties’ respective positions are best protected by an interim injunction restraining
the Defendant from carrying out any further works on the site pending the substantive hearing of the Summons.  Taking into account
the offer of undertaking by the Defendant, I order that upon (i) the Plaintiff undertaking to comply with any order the court may
make if the court should later find that the order herein has caused loss to the Defendant or any other party and decides that the
Defendant or that other party should be compensated for that loss, and (ii) the Defendant undertaking whether by himself, his servants
or agents or otherwise howsoever, not to carry out or continue any construction works on the Lot pending the substantive hearing
of the Summons:- 10.  Lastly, I order that the costs of the hearing on 19 January 2018 be costs in the cause of the Summons.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/114.html,"

CHINA INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL CORPORATION HONG KONG SECURITIES LTD v. ZHANG JIE [2018] HKCFI 94; HCA 2249/2016 (22 January 2018),"29.  In so far as it concerns the discretion in deciding the priority and timing of liquidation, such a discretion is part and parcel
of the operation of margin loans and is entirely consistent with the provisions of the margin account agreement.  The plaintiff has
explained that “[t]he timing of disposal of collateral is determined by matters such as a client’s loan to value ratio, the timing
of any margin call, the amount of any outstanding loan and the value of collateral”: see the 4th affirmation of Zhou Jiaxing, §10. 30.  The defendant may consider it “unfair” that the 2nd sale took place approximately when the share price had fallen dramatically in the interim.  But unless there is evidence to show
the sale was dishonest or in abuse or not made in good faith, fairness and reasonableness do not come into the picture.  There is
no suggestion that each of those sales were not made at market price.  None of those considerations described by the plaintiff could
be said to be inappropriate, improper or irrelevant when making decisions to liquidate in the context of margin accounts.  No prima facie case of abuse or irrationality concerning the exercise of the plaintiff’s discretion can remotely be discerned from the evidence
before the court. 31.  In my view, the submission that the plaintiff was in breach of the duty is nothing more than “moonshine” and the appeal merited
immediate dismissal.  An order was also made that the Mareva injunction be continued until further order.","ZHANG JIE (張杰)

particularly when L is attending kindergarten on Lantau on Mondays – Fridays, and the present access arrangements are working smoothly.
Further, having considered the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of L not to vary the
present access/residential arrangements during the period whenever one parent is away.  I therefore dismiss the Father’s summons. 15.  I have indicated at the hearing, the parents remain joint custodians of L, and will remind them that one parent should give the
other parent advance notice of his/her absence from Hong Kong. 16.  As for costs, the Father said he was seeking a clarification of the Court’s order, and in the end did not file any further affirmation
in support.  As I have said, there was no need for the Mother to file hers.  Having considered the circumstances, I will make no
order as to costs for this application. ",Date of Ruling: 22 January 2018(Bebe Pui Ying Chu),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/162.html,"

TOP CATERING DEVELOPMENT LTD v. CHAN SZE NGA FIONA T/A TASTY [2018] HKCFI 111; HCA 1817/2015 (23 January 2018),"12.  Under RHC O 1A r 1, the underlying objectives of the Rules of the High Court are inter alia to ensure that a case is dealt with as expeditiously as is reasonably practicable, to promote a sense of reasonable proportion and
procedural economy in the conduct of proceedings and to ensure that the resources of the court are distributed fairly.  Under RHC
O 1A r 2, the court is obliged to give effect to these underlying objectives when exercising any of its powers.  Under RHC O 1A r
4, the court is further obliged to actively manage cases by inter alia identifying the issues at an early stage and deciding promptly which issues need full investigation and trial. 13.  This court is of the firm view that giving leave to the Plaintiff to adduce the supplemental witness statement of Ng will seriously
undermine the objectives of the Rules of the High Court.  The faked meal tickets are a non‑issue in this case.  They do not require
full investigation and trial.  Allowing the Plaintiff to adduce further evidence on them will serve no purpose except to substantially
prolong the trial — properly investigating the allegation concerning the 189 faked meal tickets (or the 107 faked meal tickets
mentioned in Ng’s police statement) will require much more time than the 6 days allotted for the trial of this case.  In the end,
whatever the result of the investigation will have little bearing on the party’s pleaded claim, defence or counterclaim.  Nor will
it affect the end result of this trial.  Allowing such further evidence and such a pointless investigation is totally contrary to
the objectives of promoting a sense of reasonable proportion and procedural economy in the conduct of proceedings and ensuring the
resources of the court are distributed fairly. 14.  The Plaintiff’s application is wholly unmeritorious and is hereby dismissed.  There will be an order nisi that costs of and occasioned by the Plaintiff’s application be to the Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for

羅慧萍 v. 保誠保險有限公司 [2018] HKCFI 113; HCA 1424/2017 (23 January 2018),"60.  On the above analysis, the default was caused by P and there was no good reason for her failure to comply with the Unless Order.
P had received and was aware of D’s FBP Request dated 5 July 2017, the 31/7/17 Order (with such FBP Request annexed thereto) and
the Unless Order under the 18/10/17 Order, but chose not to comply. She insisted on being served with a filed copy of the FBP Request
that D filed on 18 October 2017 before she would even contemplate compliance by filing and serving P’s Answers when she well knew
such FBP Request filed on 18 October 2017 made the same request for particulars under the 31/7/17 and 18/10/17 Orders. This was evident
from the 14/11/17 Letter even after she was aware that D by its solicitors had applied to court by the 10/11/17 Letter to give effect
to the sanction in the Unless Order to strike out her Statement of Claim and to dismiss the present action with costs (see paragraph
29 above). Such stance was reiterated in P’s 1st and 2nd Affs (see paragraphs 32 and 36 above). There was no suggestion by P that she would now comply with the 31/7/17 and 18/10/17 Orders,
or as to how soon she would comply by filing/serving P’s Answers. No draft P’s Answers were provided to the court at the Hearing.
Rather, it was said P could comply had she been served with a filed copy of D’s FBP Request filed on 18 October 2017, but since
she was not so served she would not do so. There was no real effort made in good faith to comply with the Unless Order, and there
was no suggestion that she was unable to comply with the same. I am convinced P’s non-compliance was deliberate and intentional.
Although no milestone dates would be affected if relief were to be granted, I cannot ignore the fact that due to P’s recalcitrance,
the matter of D’s FBP Request and P’s Answers had taken more than 4 months, and D had been put to trouble and cost of various
applications to the court. In the circumstances, having considered all the circumstances (including all the factors in Order 2 rule
5(1) of the RHC and the overall administration of justice), I am not persuaded I should grant relief against sanction. 61.  In the circumstances, the Appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order
nisi that P shall pay D’s costs of and occasioned by the Appeal to be taxed if not agreed. 62.  Should P require translation of this Decision into punti language, she can contact my clerk to arrange an appointment for a court
interpreter to verbally translate this Decision to her at the High Court Building at a mutually convenient time.","保誠保險有限公司

 The Companies Court has developed a standard order for the filing of submissions and hearing bundles.  The order, which is now well
known to solicitors and counsel regularly practising in the Companies Court, goes into some detail about the way in which hearing
bundles should be prepared.  It does this, first, because in my experience, far too many solicitors adopt a casual approach to the
preparation of hearing bundles, and secondly, because the directions are specifically intended to ensure not only that the hearing
bundles are put together in a sensible way, but more particularly that they include cross referencing which allows the court to locate
items such as exhibits referred to in affirmations quickly.  This enables the court to familiarise itself with the papers promptly
and in advance of the hearing.  As far too often happens, the solicitors in this case did not prepare the hearing bundles in accordance
with those directions.  19.  As I frequently make clear when making those directions, but unfortunately my exhortations seem too frequently to fall upon deaf
ears, it is important for solicitors and counsel to read the order and to ensure that the directions have been complied with. 20.  I will make the normal winding-up order.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/192.html,"

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. FAN DI AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 346; HCMP 1761/2009 (24 January 2018),"4.  As detailed in section B3 of the statement, the acquisition of Wangda was dubious, and never proceeded to completion.  The sum of
Rmb 64.5 million paid to Double Happiness was never repaid to DC Warehouse or the Company.  The purpose of the so‑called acquisition
was, in fact, to enable the round‑robin payments to be made to Double Happiness, and further on to CM Information and CM Business.
 While there is no evidence or admission that the 1st respondent misappropriated the money himself, as Mr Lui summarised he was responsible for a number of failures in his duties as a
director of the Company as follows:  5.  There is, in these circumstances, in my view, ample basis in the agreed facts for concluding that there had been defalcation, misfeasance,
and other misconduct towards the Company in the conduct of its affairs and that the 1st respondent is a person to whom s 214(1)(b) and (c) of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap 571) applied.  There is no doubt the relevant jurisdiction of the court to make a disqualification order is engaged.  6.  The parties have not reached agreement on the number of years of disqualification.  I accept the submission of Mr Lui on behalf
of the Commission that 6 years’ disqualification would be entirely justified.  As set out in section B4 of the statement, and as
summarised above, the 1st respondent, without prior board approval, entered into relevant agreements for the purported acquisition of Wangda and caused DC
Warehouse to pay out Rmb 64.5 million to Double Happiness.  He was clearly aware of certain reports and information concerning Wangda
which he inexplicably did not disclose to the board.  In my view the case is one beyond mere lack of competence and diligence.  Moreover,
the amounts paid out eventually constituted significant losses for the Company. In my judgment, this case falls into the second of
the three brackets that conduct justifying disqualification has conventionally been divided into.  There would therefore be a disqualification
order for the period of 6 years.  There will also be an order for costs as agreed. ",Date of Decision: 24 January 2018(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/346.html,"

HK$2.02m to the Account on 18 March 2011.  There is no evidence of anything wrongful or unlawful done by the plaintiff to procure
that payment.  In any event, given his liability to the plaintiff on the guarantee, it would be circuitous to set aside the credit
of HK$2.02m only for the Account’s debit balance to be increased by the same amount. 75.  For the above reasons, the defences raised all fail.  The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.  Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff
against both defendants jointly and severally in the sum of HK$24,466,180.31 together with interest from the date of the Writ of
Summons to the date of this judgment at the usual rate of prime rate plus 1% per annum.  Thereafter interest accrues on the entire
judgment sum at judgment rate.  Mr Lai’s counterclaim is dismissed. 76.  There will be an order nisi that the plaintiff is to have the costs of the action (including the counterclaims), to be taxed if not agreed.","Jan 2011

In sentencing the Appellant, the Magistrate correctly applied the tariff sentence laid down in HKSAR v Usman Butt & Anor[3]. The Magistrate saw no reason to depart from the tariff sentence.

In so far as the continuation of the Mareva Injunction is concerned, I repeat what I have said in China Citic Bank Corporation Limited (Quanzhou Branch) v Li Kwai Chun & others [2018] HKCFI 1800 at paragraph 32, that: 18.  In the present case, having considered all the circumstances, the fraudulent nature of the conduct in particular, and the clear
risk of dissipation in the absence of any Mareva relief, I am of the view that the continuation of the Mareva Injunction post-judgment is justified.  I am however not prepared to
leave it open-ended in the manner as sought.  I impose a time limit of 30 June 2019, after which the Mareva Injunction willlapse.
 That will give the plaintiff sufficient time to take out any execution process deemed necessary.  This is however without prejudice
to any application in the future for further continuation should the circumstances justify it. 19.  For the above reasons, and subject to paragraph 18 above, I grant the Orders in terms of the Summons, together with costs of the

HKSAR v. JALLOW PATEH AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 144; HCMA 81/2017 (26 January 2018),"39.  Mr. Sean referred me to HKSAR v DARBOE LANSANA and another HCMA 153/2017 (unreported, 25 July 2017), a magistracy appeal case involving other appellants from Gambia arrested in the same police
operation.  The ground of appeal was that the sentence was excessive by reference to comparable cases in the magistrates’ courts.
In dismissing the appeal, M Poon J refused to have regards to such results in other magistrates’ courts supplied to her ladyship
by the appellants’ counsel, though such were case results of other Gambians arrested in the same police operation.  M Poon J said
she would only have authorities,not case results from magistracies.  Her Ladyship also brought to counsel’s attention to the case
of HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai HCMA 410/2008 (unreported, 26 June 2008).  It is noted that in that case, at para 11, for very small amount of heroin (less than
1 gramme), Saw J adopted the starting point of 2 years.  In the end, M Poon J dismissed the appeal (HCMA 153/2017) as the starting
point adopted by the sentencing magistrate was in line with R v Lau Tak Ming & anor [1990] 2 HKLR 370 and HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai (supra). 40.  In the present appeal, based on the above authorities, there is no doubt that the starting point of 24 months as enhanced by the
Magistrate was in line with the sentencing guidelines and was entirely proper in the circumstances.  As in the case of D1, there
were two separate offences and a partly consecutive sentence with an extra of 6 months’ sentence was therefore just and proper,
taking into account the principle of totality.  I entirely agree with the respondent that there is no merit in the appeal against
the sentences and they were neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive. 41.  Accordingly, the appeal against sentence by D1 and D3 is also dismissed.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 26 January 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/144.html,"

"HKSAR v. PILINOVICS, MARTIN ANTHONY [2018] HKCFI 147; HCMA 510/2018 (21 December 2018)","11.  The appellant has pleaded in this court that he suffers from a delusional disorder as he had been diagnosed in the UK and he said
that he had cut his wrist before coming to Hong Kong on his way to Taiwan to see his fiancée.  However, I do not see how that would
serve as proper mitigation in this case.  The fact is it was an opportunistic theft at the time he took the property from the lift.
 It was an opportunistic burglary when he climbed over the glass wall partition to steal the ticket and not only did he do it once,
he did it twice by climbing over that glass partition again and stealing the printer rolls. 12.  His second ground of appeal is that he asked for leniency to reduce the sentence so that he can go back to the UK to deal with matters
needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence. 13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There
is no merit to this appeal and so the appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

HUANG YU HUI v. ZHENG SHIZHI (ALSO KNOWN AS ZHENG SHIZHI) [2018] HKCFI 174; HCA 646/2015 (26 January 2018),"16.  Mr Tang places emphasis in his written submission on the fact that the defendant has only obtained a conditional leave to defence
and that the defence is described as “shadowy”.  Nevertheless, it has to be borne in mind that this is a case for specific performance
and (as noted in the Judgement[5]) normally no condition would be attached if leave to defend was granted.  In the present case, the conditional leave to defence was
granted after consideration of a host of factors, including the defendant’s poor track record of meeting time requirements and
that the plaintiff was said to have paid $2.12 million as deposits which had not been repaid by the defendant.  The condition was
therefore imposed as a means to protect the plaintiff’s potential interest and to ensure that the defence would be proceeded with
some diligently.  In the circumstances, this court takes the view that the fact the defendant is granted leave to defend on condition
is not a sufficient reason for not awarding him the costs arising from the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment which is
based mainly on a misunderstanding of the law and which, in the view of this court, also is ill-conceived. 17.  Based on all the above, the present application by the plaintiff for variation is refused and the costs order nisi is hereby made absolute. 18.

contemplated that Au would render proper, complete and accurate Ordered Accounts. Thus, I do not find the provision in Form 23 helpful.
Of more interest is Atkin’s Court Forms Form 24 at p 645, which is another standard form order for account that deals with supporting vouchers: 26.  For the above reasons, at the Hearing, I approve the Draft Order subject to the following: (a) the amendments marked in red in paragraphs

what they contended. But the Defts were successful in refuting the amendments proposed by Au, and the change in paragraph 26(c) above

against Mr Lau who will be in a position to seek a contribution in respect of those from the other director and shareholder.  I make
no judicial determination that such a request for a contribution would be well-founded in law.  Nonetheless, it would clearly be
open to Mr Lau to seek a contribution from his co-minority shareholder since it seems highly likely that those twoshareholders were
acting jointly with respect to the filing of the Form ND2A.   21.  The outcome would be that, in effect, the costs of the Originating Summons are shared as between the all three of the disputant
parties; the applicant on the one side and the other two shareholders on the other.  Accordingly, for the reasons that I have given,
I will make an order that Mr Lau must pay half of Mr Cao’s costs of the Originating Summons, to be taxed if not agreed. 22.  This was a case where both sides were justified in seeking representation through counsel.  It involved some issues of law and analysis

Finally, I have also not overlooked the 2nd defendant’s allegation that she has difficulty in obtaining an expert opinion given that upon her report, the police is still investigating

even assist the police investigation. 14.

The 2nd defendant complained that this is not the plaintiff’s pleaded case.  In my judgment, this is not pleaded because this partnership
point is raised only in relation to the defence raised by the 2nd defendant.  It is raised to say that even on the 2nd defendant’s own evidence, she could not succeed. 15.

The question which the court will then ask is whether the order for sale would not be beneficial or would cause very great hardship
to the 2nd defendant.  The test is an objective one.  Mr Chan submitted that to determine this question, the Court would have to consider all
the relevant circumstances, including the comparative benefits to the plaintiffs.  Thus, he submitted, if the debts actually have
been paid off or very little, or can be paid off by some other means, the prejudice or the hardship caused to the co-owner would
be larger.  I disagree.  To approach the question, the Court is not required to consider the matter in a comparative approach.  What
the Court has to consider is objectively, whether to the co-owner, it would not be beneficial or would cause great hardship.  Recorder Fok SC did not summarise the test as whether compared with the benefit to be obtained by the applicant, the benefit to the co-owner would be great or not. 8.  It remains for me to add that the present action is not the appropriate forum for the defendants to vent out their grievance.  If
the 1st defendant or even the 2nd defendant has any complaints to make concerning the administration of the property of the 1st defendant, they still have redress.  In particular, there is nothing to prevent them from applying to the Court by appropriate procedure
to give appropriate directions or orders pursuant to its supervisory jurisdiction over the plaintiffs as trustees under sections 83 and 97 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 6).  In this regard, Mr Chan contended that the Court of First Instance, including this court, has the jurisdiction to deal with this
matter because section 2 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance defines “court” as “Court of First Instance sitting in its bankruptcy jurisdiction”.  While I agree that the Court of First
Instance has jurisdiction in general, the question still is whether those complaints raised by the defendants are relevant.  If they
were relevant, they would be considered whether or not certain procedure is complied with under the Bankruptcy Ordinance.  However, since I have ruled that they are irrelevant, I do not need to labour on this point further. 9.

never told the defendant what copyright work the plaintiff was relying on, and thus there could not be any knowledge.  On the plaintiff’s
case, the Plaintiff’s Product had been issued earlier than the Defendant’s Product, and the plaintiff and the defendants were
competitors.  At this stage, I am not satisfied, with the defendant’s mere allegation of absence of knowledge, that it is plain
and obvious that the defendant had no knowledge of the requisite degree.  Thus, I also reject this ground. 15.  The last ground concerns the relief for an injunction.  The defendant argues that because the defendant has removed the Defendant’s
Products from sale in Hong Kong and undertook not to restock the Defendant’s Products, there is no practical need for an injunction.
 The plaintiff disagrees, pointing out that the defendant has made it clear that it would contest the plaintiff’s claim.  Further,
in any event, the undertaking was too vague and not enough to get in place of the injunctive relief being sought for.  In my judgment,
it is not so plain and obvious that there is no risk of the defendant’s selling the Defendant’s Product in the future.  On the
contrary, absent any undertaking, an order may still be necessary. 16.  In the circumstances, I dismiss the defendant’s summons.  I shall hear submissions on costs and directions.",Date of Handing Down of Written Decision : 30 January 2018(Gary C C Lam),Master of the High Court,/2018/179.html,"

EXCELSIOR CAPITAL ASIA (HK) LTD AND ANOTHER v. ZHANG HENGSHUN (PARTNER IN AND TRADING AS KING &AMP; WOOD MALLESONS (A FIRM) AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 181; HCCL 14/2016 (30 January 2018),"32.  Other than the availability of the witnesses who will be in the position to give evidence on the communications between the Plaintiffs
and the Partners on the issue of the Plaintiffs’ alleged knowledge of the defects in the Right, the parties have not identified
other factors which are relevant to the consideration of the appropriate forum for the trial.  There are no issues raised concerning
the Transaction or the listing of DS in Hong Kong which require determination at trial.  No question of juridical advantage has been
raised. 33.  Having regard to all the matters identified in paragraphs 25 to 32 above, I have come to the inevitable conclusion that Hong Kong
is not the appropriate forum for the trial of this action, and that the judges in the Mainland courts, with their in-depth understanding
and knowledge of the relevant PRC laws, the policy considerations and the practices of the Mainland authorities, would be more familiar
with and be better able to decide the issues in dispute in this case.  The Partners have identified the Shanghai No 1 Intermediate
People’s Court, the Shanghai Xuhui District People’s Court or the Jiangxi High People’s Court as the relevant Mainland court
which is the more appropriate forum, depending on the nature and size of the Plaintiffs’ claim against the Partners. 34.  I accordingly grant the orders sought in the Partners’ summons, to set aside the Order and to stay these proceedings, on the basis
that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum for the trial of claims made in this action.  An order nisi will be made that the costs
of the Partners’ application are to be paid by the Plaintiffs, with Certificate for 2 Counsel.",Date of Decision: 30 January 2018(Mimmie Chan),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/181.html,"

TANG SIU CHOI v. MAN LUNG TEXTILES LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 125; HCMP 1351/2017 (31 January 2018),"27.  At paragraph 2 of the originating summons, Tang seeks “costs of and incidental to the application and the derivative action be
indemnified by Man Lung out of its assets or, alternatively, be paid by Tam personally on an indemnity basis”. 28.  As far as costs of this application are concerned, this court is satisfied that Tang was acting in good faith and had reasonable
grounds for making the application.  Given Tam’s unjustified opposition, there seems no reason why such costs should be paid out
of Man Lung’s assets.  In this court’s view, ordering a company to bear the member’s costs of a proper leave application will
only serve to encourage unjustified opposition by the intended defendant to the proposed derivative action in future.  There shall
be an order nisi that costs of this application be borne by Tam, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel. 29.  As to whether the Court should grant an order that the costs of the derivative action be indemnified out of the assets of Man Lung
or be borne by Tam personally, even Mr Hon recognises, at paragraph 18 of his written submissions, that the Court very often would
defer such determination when the outcome of the statutory derivative action is known or when the position is clearer: Re Grand Field Group Holdings Ltd unrep, HCMP 1059/2008, Kwan J (as she then was) at [50].  I agree and will defer the matter to a subsequent occasion.  There will

the plaintiff’s application.  The plaintiff and the Court were further reminded of the fact that the defendant is on legal aid.
 They requested the addition to the nisi order words to the effect that the defendant’s own costs be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations. 3.  As the defendant has been on legal aid: 4.  In the circumstances, the application for a forthwith costs order has to be refused.   Given the forthcoming Estate Action trial,
the similarity in the nature of some of the factual issues involved, and the effect of Section 16C(1)(b)(ii), I also do not deem it appropriate to order summary assessment at this stage, but would leave the matter till the end.  I would therefore
simply modify the nisi order as follows, that the plaintiff shall have the costs of this application, to be taxed if not agreed, and the defendant’s own
costs to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.",Date of Decision on Costs: 31 January 2018(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/212.html,"

HYUNDAI MERCHANT MARINE (HONG KONG) LTD v. MA CHUN KIT [2018] HKCFI 176; HCMP 1115/2017 (1 February 2018),"69.  I am unable to agree with Mr Mughal because, like the Credit Cards, failure to service the outstanding payment would normally result
in closure of account and legal action by the service provider.  Whilst it would not be a desirable situation, it cannot be equated
with diminution of assets.  The proper course was for Ma to negotiate a sensible solution with Hyundai Marine, failing which he might
apply to the court.  He was not entitled to take the matter into his own hands in the face of the Order.  70.  In the premises, there is no doubt that Ma had breached the Restriction on Disposal of Assets in respect of the payment of HK$916,950,

the girls, there were more girls, there was an element of illegal working and the scale of operation.  Further the applicable maximum
is now 10 years’ imprisonment.  For these reasons the sentence passed by the magistrate in this case may be said to be on the low
side.   30.  What discount is available to the appellant for the unreasonable delay in charging the appellant is however in my view offset by
the moderate sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment.  31.  For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal against sentence was dismissed.  The sentence was not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.

represented by the 2nd and 3rd defendants and that the 2nd and 3rd defendants should compensate Castle World.  This clearly shows that at least at the initial stage, the plaintiff also took the position
that Castle World had a cause of action against the 2nd and 3rd defendants. 52.  Mr Ng said that this was pre-application correspondence only and such position was a mistake.  He referred to subsequent pre-application
correspondence which asked the 2nd and 3rd defendants to focus on the Statement of Claim.  However, the plaintiff’s correspondence did not traverse the previous position
that Castle World had a cause of action.  Instead, the plaintiff’s correspondence gave me an impression that the plaintiff would
wish to have the cake and eat it, in that on the one hand, he would like to maintain the Statement of Claim, and on the other hand,
he would not wish to say anything in the correspondence which may be taken as waiving any claim available to Castle World. 53.  In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the plaintiff’s claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants was so unreasonable and such an abuse of process that costs on indemnity basis should be ordered.","T.K.

 If I had not considered tracing to be a significant factor, would the balance have tilted in favour of Hong Kong as the appropriate
forum?  The answeris “yes”.  I remain of the view that the other factors set out in paragraph 41are more significant factors
in the context of this case than those relied upon by the 2nd defendant.  I remain of the view that the 2nd defendant failed to establish that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum and that Singapore is clearly or distinctly more appropriate
than Hong Kong and I refer to paragraphs 40 to 44 of my Decision.  For this reason, I consider that the fourth ground of appeal does
not have a reasonable prospect of success. 31.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the defendants’ application for leave to appeal. 32.

In the ultimate analysis, where one is concerned, as here, with innumerable sale and purchase transactions in relation to Qunxing

MGA ENTERTAINMENT INC. v. JEAN CHRISTOPHE BUREUIL [2018] HKCFI 354; HCMP 1036/2017 (6 February 2018),"6.  Secondly as regards the set-off, the plaintiff has taken enforcement actions in France, but all to no avail.  It would appear that
the defendant has managed to arrange his affairs in such a way that he has no assets left there.  The French proceedings in respect
of which a costs order was made related to the plaintiff’s application to set aside a so-called ‘donation’ — a gift made
by the defendant to his grandchildren of a French property.  Costs of €4,500 were ordered against the plaintiff but that decision
obtained in 2017 is under appeal, so at the moment, there is nothing owing, as such, to the defendant.  7.  Ms Tong, who appears for the plaintiff, asks for costs on an indemnity basis, the reasons are that the defendant has really been
abusing the process of the court.  He had made numerous applications for extensions of time, and then abandoned the opportunity of
filing further evidence or indeed of appearing today.  I am satisfied that it is really disgraceful that a litigant should take up
the court’s time in mounting what are wholly unmeritorious applications, and then not even responding to an offer made by the plaintiff
that he should abandon these proceedings and the hearing vacated in order to save costs and time.  8.

andvexatious.  Mr Lau, on behalf of the defendants, contests this on the basis that the defendants were simply contesting and questioning
the Master’s approach.  13.  Appeals against costs orders made by Masters are not to be encouraged and, in appropriate circumstances, indemnity costs orders
should be made.  However, the Master here, in fact dismissed the plaintiff’s application and, in my view, it was not totally without
merit for the defendants to question the approach then adopted by the Master with regard to costs.  As such, I decline an order of
indemnity costs. The plaintiff will have its costs of and occasioned by this appeal, to be taxed if not agreed.  14.  So the order I make is that:",Date of Decision: 6 February 2018(Robert Whitehead SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2018/466.html,"

was titular rather than substantive.  There is simply no evidence that to show that his 40% interest was not real or that the only
person who could ever benefit from the business was Tang.  By no stretch of the imagination was Sy a ‘vulnerable’ person within
the example given in Mahon. 57.  Against the backdrop of the broader canvass and having regard to the matters highlighted, I have no hesitation in concluding that
the defences of misrepresentation and undue influence are not arguable on the evidence presented.  58.  For all the above reasons, the appeal was allowed with costs. ",Date of Reasons for Decision: 7 February 2018(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/247.html,"

Significantly, the following passage from the Attorney General’s explanation (at p 36) throws considerable light on the construction

RE THE JOINT PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHINA LUMENA NEW MATERIALS CORP (IN PROVISIONAL LIQUIDATION) [2018] HKCFI 276; HCMP 494/2017 (7 February 2018),"6.  I see the logic of the Provisional Liquidators’ argument.  Pursued to its logical conclusion, foreign insolvency officeholders
appointed in the country of incorporation of the company would be able to do everything in Hong Kong that are within the powers of
the company’s directors without a prior Hong Kong court order.  For instance, without obtaining a Hong Kong recognition order,
the foreign insolvency officeholders would be able to dispose of Hong Kong assets or transfer Hong Kong assets to other jurisdictions.
However, this in my view would be going too far and would go even further than international insolvency standards embodied in the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (see Article 21). 7.  In my view, a balance has to be drawn between the foreign insolvency officeholders’ need for convenience and the need for court
supervision which the creditors may expect.  Therefore, a distinction does have to be drawn between the foreign insolvency officeholders’
information needs and their ability to deal with assets in Hong Kong.  Provided the directors of the company could obtain the information,
the foreign insolvency officeholders as agents of the company should be able to obtain the same information from third parties, such
as bank account documents in Hong Kong, without a prior Hong Kong recognition order.  This would help simplify the foreign insolvency
officeholders’ investigative functions. 8.  However, if the foreign insolvency officeholders propose to take possession of or deal with assets in Hong Kong, it would be appropriate
for them to obtain a Hong Kong recognition order first.  Lest it be thought that this would impose a significant burden on foreign
insolvency officeholders, practitioners are reminded that this Court has already developed a standard practice on applications for
recognition orders and such applications may be granted very quickly.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 7 February 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/276.html,"

HKSAR v. MAHAMOUD OSMAN MAHAMED [2018] HKCFI 367; HCMA 30/2018 (7 February 2018),"6.  The appellant during the trial was represented by counsel instructed by the duty lawyer service.  The learned magistrate then carefully
assessed the evidence and found that he accepted the prosecution witnesses’ evidence and did not believe the appellant’s evidence.
 The learned magistrate then considered the law in relation to whether in law the appellant could be said have been in employment.
 After considering all the relevant cases, the learned magistrate found that at the time, the appellant was adjusting the height
of the table, fixing a screw and obviously setting up the stall at that time.  The appellant was therefore working at the time and
there was no evidence of any special relationship between the appellant and the shop or shop owner.  The only irresistible inference
is that the appellant was working under employment at that time. 7.  On appeal, the appellant is unrepresented and the appellant maintained that he was not working at that time and there is insufficient
evidence to convict him.  This is entirely a question of fact upon which the learned magistrate was entitled to find from the evidence
before him.  And from the fact found by the learned magistrate, he was entitled to draw the only irresistible inference that the
appellant was under employment at that time. 8.  I do not find that there are any grounds to interfere with the conviction, so the appeal against conviction is dismissed.",Date of Judgment: 7 February 2018(E Toh),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/367.html,"

and he said that the evidence was insufficient for him to be convicted of the charge and that the learned magistrate therefore should
not have found him guilty. 9.  In relation to the sentence, he said that the sentence was too long and asked for a reduction in sentence.  I have read the learned
magistrate’s Statement of Findings in relation to the conviction, she is the best person to find the facts as she had observed
all the witnesses giving evidence in court.  She had given the reasons for convicting the appellant of the charge and she had also

HKSAR v. SHAMSHER SINGH AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 372; HCMA 651/2017 (7 February 2018),"10.  As to charge four to which the second appellant had pleaded guilty, the facts disclosed that he had worked for PW1 at various locations
between early July 2016 to 31 May 2017.  The second appellant had been granted recognizance on 5 February 2016 and was told that
he cannot take up employment.  In considering sentence in relation to the second appellant, the learned magistrate had listened to
the mitigation put forward by his counsel and the fact that the second appellant had a clear record.  Again the learned magistrate
considered the case of HKSAR v Li Chang Li, HCMA 935/2004 and considered that the usual starting point for charge three is 22 and a‑half months.  As for charge four, the
learned magistrate considered the case of HKSAR v Usman Butt and another, HCMA 70/2010 that a starting point of 22 and a‑half months is appropriate, because the appellant had pleaded guilty, he reduced
the sentence to 15 months’ imprisonment.  Again, having considered the totality principle, the learned magistrate made both sentences
concurrent. 11.  The second appellant also complained that the sentences were too long and urged this court to reduce the sentences.  As I had indicated
above, the learned magistrate had already considered the salient points in the case and appropriately considered the sentencing guideline
and therefore at the end of the day had correctly sentenced in both charges which the second appellant faced. 12.  I cannot see there are any reasons to disturb the sentences and I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence of the second
appellant.",Date of Judgment: 7 February 2018(E Toh),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/372.html,"

an undervalue.  Indeed, the consideration provided by the Respondents exceeded the value of the Bankrupt’s interest in the Property,
which was assessed at HK$400,000 by the Trustees.  37.  Further, in light of the evidence of the Respondents, I cannot agree that the Transaction constituted an unfair preference by the
Bankrupt of his brothers.  The Transaction was not influenced by the Bankrupt’s desire to favour his brothers in the event of his
bankruptcy, but by the Bankrupt’s desire to get out of the financial hole in which he found himself.  I find the presumption under
s.50(5) of the Ordinance, which is relied upon by the Trustees, rebutted.  38.  For these reasons, the Summons is dismissed, and I make an order nisi that the costs of and occasioned by the Summons, including
the Respondents’ costs, be paid out of the estate of the Bankrupt. ",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/249.html,"

RE THE JOINT LIQUIDATORS OF SUPREME TYCOON LIMITED (IN LIQUIDATION IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS) [2018] HKCFI 277; [2018] 1 HKLRD 1120; [2018] 2 HKC 485; HCMP 833/2017 (8 February 2018),"17.  Therefore the mere fact of a foreign liquidation being a voluntary liquidation is no bar to the Hong Kong court recognising and
assisting that liquidation under the principle of modified universalism.  However, if the foreign liquidation is a solvent liquidation
(for instance, a members’ voluntary liquidation), it would not fall within the principle of modified universalism.  A foreign solvent
liquidation is not a collective insolvency proceeding, and is more akin to the “private arrangement” the Privy Council was referring
to.  In this connection, with respect, I agree with Lord Neuberger’s dissenting observations in Singularis.[11] Accordingly, unlike the Singapore court, I would not rely on the US Bankruptcy Court’s decision in In re Betcorp Limited [12] which concerns an Australian members’ voluntary liquidation being recognised under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code.  At any
rate, it appears that Betcorp is a controversial decision even from the perspective of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: see Look Chan Ho, Cross-Border Insolvency: A Commentary on the UNCITRAL Model Law,[13] pp 185–189; UNCITRAL Guide to Enactment and Interpretation of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross‑Border Insolvency (2013) at [73]. 18.  In the present case, if the Company’s liquidation in the BVI were a compulsory winding-up, there would be no question that this
Court could recognise the applicants as joint liquidators of the Company and assist them in carrying out their functions.  It follows
from above principles that there is no bar to this Court recognising and assisting the applicants as joint liquidators of the Company,
despite the fact that the Company’s liquidation was commenced by a shareholders’ resolution.  The Company’s liquidation in
the BVI is a collective insolvency proceeding.  In any event, as the applicants are officers of the Supreme Court, though not appointed
as such by the Supreme Court, they probably could be recognised even under the Privy Council’s more restrictive approach in Singularis.[14] 19.  For the reasons I have given, I consider that there is no impediment to granting the recognition order the applicants seek and I
shall so order.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/277.html,"

of audited financial statements, the election of certain individuals to the board and declaring that the defendant was not re-elected

there must have been obviously reasons for the updates to be material and significant.  I am sure it is unusual for so much COI information
to be updated but it would be prejudicial to the applicant who was in person if the adjudicator did not ensure the information she
relied upon was the most recent.  A check online would ensure this was the case and an up-to-date list of COI information in the

arguable and has merit. 39.  As a result of my finding above, it is not necessary to go into the merits of ground 3 which essentially was an alternative ground

"LEUNG KIT HING, DORIS v. ELECTORAL AFFAIRS COMMISSION [2018] HKCFI 255; HCAL 1016/2017 (9 February 2018)","20.  This having been said, it must be recognized that underlying the general position that applications for leave to apply for judicial
review are disposed of on an ex parte basis is the assumption that the applications are properly formulated and presented, with the proposed grounds of judicial review
being clearly, logically and succinctly set out in the Form 86 and properly supported by relevant evidence in the affidavit required
to be filed under Order 53, rule 3(2) of the Rules of the High Court.  Increasingly, however, the court is faced with applications for leave to apply for judicial review which are not properly formulated
or presented, and where the proposed grounds of judicial review are obscure or unintelligible.  The result is that the court cannot
properly deal with the leave applications on an ex parte basis, but has to direct an oral hearing to determine the matter with the assistance of evidence and/or submissions from the putative
respondent in order to do justice to both parties.  The present is such a case. 21.  Ultimately, the principle remains that costs lie in the discretion of the court which must retain the flexibility to make or refuse
to make an award of costs as the particular circumstances of the case and justice warrant.   In determining the question of costs
in this case, I also take into account the following matters:- 22.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the Applicant should pay the EAC’s costs of resisting the two applications, to be taxed

charges  it claimed to be payable under the Agreement.  The institution of 44 was totally contrary to the objectives of the CJR,

when Octo’s claims could have been raised by counterclaim, and there is more than ample armory under the Rules of the High Court

the special issue carefully and made the ruling that the answers were provided by the appellant voluntarily.  In my view, the magistrate,
after detailed assessment of the evidence before him, rightly had properly rejected the evidence of the appellant both on the special
and general issue.  He had seen and heard the witnesses and was entitled to form the view as he did.  Once that interview was admitted,
a conviction is simply inevitable. 13.  The appellant has raised the issue of D2’s interview.  At first, I failed to comprehend why D2’s cautioned interviews were exhibited
at the appellant’s trial.  I accepted explanation by counsel for the respondent at the appeal hearing that those interviews were
left as exhibits after D2’s case was withdrawn on completion of the evidence of two prosecution witnesses.  She conceded that the
better practice was to apply to withdraw D2’s two cautioned interviews immediately upon D2’s discharge since D2 was no longer
on trial and there was no basis for the admission of such as exhibits in the appellant’s trial.  In fact, to the contrary of the
appellant’s submission, answers 14 and 27 in the first of those interviews simply lent no support to the Defence case.  Instead,
they are prejudicial and could implicate the appellant.  The magistrate was correct in paying no heed to the contents of those interviews
in reaching his findings, and had clearly demonstrated such in his Statement of Findings. 14.  I would not have come to a different conclusion had I been the trial magistrate.  There is ample evidence to find that the appellant

Costs of and occasioned by the summons to adduce further affirmation be in the cause of the amended petition.  Costs of the security
application, I am going to summarily assess it and allow it to Mr Zhao.  In my view, Mr Hudson was correct; an applicant for security
ought to discuss the appropriate quantum in order to save court hearings.  In the present case, in my view, the million-dollar security
sought is excessive for the petition.  I therefore allow a sum of $40,000 to be paid by the petitioner to Mr Zhao Xi for the security
application.  This is subject to the production of the bill of costs issued by the solicitors to the company or Mr Zhao Xi as regards
the security application to the court within 7 days.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/542.html,"

opinion of the court substantial wrong or miscarriage has thereby occasioned (see paragraph 34 above). I am not persuaded there was
an arguable basis to suggest there was substantial wrong or miscarriage. It must be remembered the application was made at the eve
of the Trial, and even D herself acknowledged it was late, so late that D envisaged that if she were allowed to adduce expert evidence,
either Liu would have to give oral evidence at the Trial without letting C know what she was going to say (as there would be no expert
report) or the Trial would have to adjourned to enable Liu to be prepare an expert report (see footnote 2 above). On either scenario
there would be prejudice to C (by having to meet expert evidence in the dark or by having its day in court delayed), and having regard
to all the circumstances, including the potential disruption to the Trial, the prejudice to C and the lateness of the application,
there is no basis to say that DPO’s exercise of discretion was substantially wrong or there was miscarriage. 94.

the following day without giving HSBC an opportunity to respond.  Had the seven day ‘grace period’ been allowed, it is possible
that these proceedings would not have been necessary. 45.  As I have observed, and while it may have taken longer than Murray would have liked, a certain amount of information and documents
have already been obtained from HSBC over several months.  HSBC has also already indicated in correspondence, most recently to the
court on 22 January 2018, that it will not oppose the making of an order requiring that it produce any remaining information and
documents (and has stated that it is already taking steps in this regard).  Accordingly, I order that Devonport pay HSBC the costs
of this action and the costs of compliance with any order made on an indemnity basis and further reimburse HSBC for all other reasonable
costs of compliance with the order, all such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  46.  Finally, I direct that this decision be published after the expiry of 30 days from the date of handing down the decision but I give

for the matter to be “adjourned sine die with liberty to restore on grounds of (1) (2) above”.  For reasons stated above, paragraphs
1 and 2 of the Summons have no merits.  It follows that there is no good reason to grant any extension of time for the Applicant
to serve the notice of appeal based on the matters mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Summons. 7.  Lastly, in paragraph 4 of the Summons, the Applicant seeks an order that there be no order as to the costs of the proceedings. 
The Applicant argues that the court could not deal with the interim relief application prior to the grant of leave to apply for judicial
review.  It should be noted that the hearing on 2 February 2018 was a combined hearing of both the application for leave to apply
judicial review and the application for interim relief.  It is clear from the Decision itself that the application for interim relief
was rejected because the court considered that the application for leave to apply for judicial review was not reasonably arguable
and the Applicant lacked standing in the matter.  The reasons for making the costs order were explained in paragraphs 19 to 21 of
the Decision.  Nothing has been said which convinces me that the costs order was wrongly made.  I should also mention that the costs
order made on 9 February 2018 was not an order nisi. For these reasons, I do not consider that there is any valid ground to vary the costs order previously made. 8.

In the meantime, on 19 January 2018, the plaintiff took out an application pursuant to section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance and the inherent jurisdiction of the court for inspection of banker’s records in relation to certain account.  One of the accounts
the records of which the plaintiff seeks to inspect is held in the name of D2 with the Bank of Communication Co Ltd.  D1 is the sole
signatory of that account.  That summons had not however been served upon D1.  D2 consented to that order upon the condition that
it be shown any banker’s records in relation to that account which the plaintiff might be permitted to inspect.  The summons came
before me on 6 February 2018.  During that hearing, I raised the issue as to whether the summons for inspection ought to have been
served upon D1.  The matter was ultimately adjourned for substantive argument on 20 February 2018.  D2 now comes before me for time
to file the affirmation pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Order made by L Chan J on 26 January 2018. 5.  I have considered the submissions made on behalf of the parties.  I regard it as fair that before D2 files its affirmation pursuant
to the direction made by L Chan J, it should have the result of the application for inspection.  In particular, should the application
for inspection be successful, it should have the benefit of the relevant banker’s records for the purpose of preparingits affirmation.
 The plaintiff has agreed to show D2 those records if the order for inspection is granted.  After all, those records, if and when
available, will be discoverable to D2 in the normal course of event.  6.  In the circumstances, as a matter of fairness and having looked at the full picture, I grant D2 an extension of 28 days from the

AKBANK T.A.S. v. MAINFORD LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 363; HCA 3264/2016 (22 February 2018),"15.  Whilst those italicized criteria were no doubt correct at the time when the judgment was pronounced, I have reservation as to whether
it has become too restrictive in modern time.  These days, bank accounts in the international banking system can be exploited to
syphon off and launder funds even though there is absolutely no connection between the holders of the accounts involved, and when
one holder may not at all be concerned with the operation of the other accounts.  The imposition of such stringent and restrictive
criteria in my view may unnecessarily fetter the court’s discretion under section 21.  In my view, the pivotal test should be that, and should remain that, of relevance as explained by Barnett J in Assets Investment. 16.  I have read the 14th Affirmation of Mr Desmond Steward filed in support of the present application, and the affirmation of service of Mr Fung Wai Man.
 I have heard submissions made by Mr Ng on behalf of the plaintiff.  I approach the application with great caution.  I note the scale
of the fraud, that the 2nd and 5th defendants were according to the pleaded case of the plaintiff two of the first level recipients, and that default judgments have
been entered against them.  I note the close proximity in time between the fraudulent transfers from the plaintiff’s accounts on
the one hand and the transfers from Real Friendship to the 5th defendant on the other.  I further note the outward transfers by the 5thdefendant on the following day, and that one of the transfers was to the sole director and shareholder of the 2nd defendant.  The information sought is clearly relevantto the fundflow of the proceeds of the fraud, to the relationship between Real
Friendship and the 5th defendant, and is potentially admissible evidence against both of them.  When exercising my discretion, I have considered the fact
that Real Friendship has been deregistered and could not be served with the summons.  I have considered the importance of the maintenance
of banker/customer confidence.  On the other hand, neither the 5th defendant nor Real Friendship is going to be irreparably harmed or even inconvenienced by the order.  I put in the balance also the
important policy consideration that, Hong Kong being an international city, the law should be facilitative but not obstructive when
a victim of a cybercrime (like what the plaintiff is according to its case) comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the
true culprits.  On the facts of this case, the balance tips clearly in favour of me exercising my discretion granting the order.
 I am in all the circumstances satisfied that an order in terms of the summons ought to be made. 17.  I make no order as to costs.",(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/363.html,"

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. CHEONG KAI TJIEH AUGUSTINE AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 437; HCA 2269/2012 (22 February 2018),"5.  Mr Cheong did raise a technical issue before me, namely, whether or not section 49 of the High Court Ordinance, Cap 4, applies at all to the order made on 13 March 2017, although he accepted that the consent summons necessarily provided that
the judgment rate of interest would be paid for at least the period specified in the summons.  It seems to me quite clear that section 49 does apply to the order.  This is dealt with in the commentary to the Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018: see paras 42/1/6 and 42/1/11.  It seems to me clear that the statutory rate of interest on a judgment applies to a registered order
of the Tribunal from the date on which the order contained in the report handed down by the Tribunal is made. 6.  It is clearly desirable that applications of this sort are dealt with promptly as they will not normally be controversial.  As I
have already indicated, it seems to me that it is not appropriate or necessarily efficient for the applications to be dealt with
in writing, although it is desirable that the parties agree the terms of the order that is sought from the court and that an application
for a short expedited hearing is made in order that the mechanism for implementing the orders of the Tribunal can be made promptly
and, if they involve the payment of money, that interest does not continue to run for an unnecessarily extended period.  7.  I will therefore make an order in the terms of the revised draft handed up by Mr Dawes which updates the interest calculation until
22 February 2018. Interest will, however, continue to accrue until the actual date of transfer, although I anticipate that the Commission
will be able to have the order perfected and the payment out of court made very promptly.",Date of Decision: 22 February 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/437.html,"

claim and settled the matter at the hearing before Master Leong such that allcosts which he was ordered to pay in this action would
not have been incurred and wasted.  This argument is disingenuous.  His challenge about the accuracy was only raised after Master
Leong had entered the Order 88 Judgment.  As Deputy Judge Poon held, his request for statements and records was just a delaying tactic
and that the calculations were correct.  These findings were all upheld on appeal.  His conduct throughout these proceedings indicated
that his sole intention behind his request for bank statements and records was to delay the legal process with his repeated unmeritorious
appeals and applications to stay.  He had no intention to pay.  His argument that had he been given the statements and records he
would have settled the action is artificial and disingenuous.  The legal costs he sought to recover under the wasted costs order
were costs he was ordered to pay for his losing the action. He only had himself to blame for taking such an obstinate course.  Those
costs fall outside the scope of the wasted costs.  25.  The defendant claims the difference between interest on the outstanding amount calculated at judgment rate and the contractual rate.
 He has not advanced any ground for this claim.  In any event, it is outside thescope of the wasted costs order provisions.  There
is no issue about Chan’s conduct which justifies the court’s exercise of its wasted costs jurisdiction. 26.  For the above reasons, there is no evidence that Chan acted improperly or was guilty of misconduct in the prosecution of the proceedings.
 The defendant has failed even to satisfy the court that he has passed first stage required for the court to consider exercising
the wasted costs order jurisdiction.  His wasted costs order application is bound to fail.  Suffice it is to say that to insist to
pursue a cause of action which is bound to fail is a clear abuse of proceedings.  The defendant’s summons should therefore be struck
out as an abuse of the process of the court and with costs to Chan Ning Chun Charles on indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 23 February 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/396.html,"

CHAN FAI CHEUNG v. HO CHI WING T/A HANSON ENGINEERING CO AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 399; HCPI 354/2016 (23 February 2018),"5.  The test of dissipation of assets is objective. The Court is concerned with the effect of the defendant’s conduct as opposed to
the motives underlying the conduct.  So it is not necessary to show that a defendant would remove his assets out of reach of the
plaintiff for the purpose of defeating any judgment that the plaintiff might obtain against him.  However, the mere fact that the conduct of a defendant is likely
to deplete his assets available for judgment is not sufficient.  A defendant is entitled to incur expenses in going about his ordinary
life or business, repay his genuine debts as they fall due, and to spend money in defending himself against the plaintiff’s claim.
 It has never been the purpose of a Mareva injunction to give to a plaintiff security over a defendant’s assets in priority to
other creditors.  Something more than a real risk that the judgment will go unsatisfied is required.  (See TTMI Ltd of England v ASM Shipping Ltd of India [2006] 1 Llyod’s Rep 401.) Despite the tendency to refer to a defendant’s alleged “unacceptably low standard of commercial
morality” as the basis for seeking a Mareva injunction, the courts have warned against too readily drawing inferences of a real
risk of dissipation from the conduct of a defendant. 6.  In this case, even if the 1st Defendant’s sale of his property may have the effect that the property or its proceeds would be out of the Plaintiff’s reach
in the eventual execution of any judgment in his favour, it cannot be established that such sale would have the effect of depleting
the 1st Defendant’s assets which would otherwise be available for execution of the judgment: since the sale and the use of the proceeds of sale are shown to be for legitimate purposes: of discharging
the 1st Defendant’s obligations under the various court orders made against him, including his liability to the Plaintiff, and for legitimate
expenses in and consequential to the sale.  There is no sound basis to draw the inferences which the Plaintiff has asked the court
to draw against the 1st Defendant’s series of conduct outlined, including his petition for divorce. 7.  The injunction is discharged and the Summons for its continuation is dismissed, with costs to be paid by the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant.

MP v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 151; HCAL 367/2017 (28 February 2018),"45.  To invoke the protection of Article 3 or BOR 3 risk, the applicant has to meet two requirements.  The adjudicator here has stated
the test for assessing the persecution risk is virtually the same as that for assessing BOR 3.  He also says when assessing persecution
risk in para 40, I quote “the appellant has (not) suffered severe injury or serious harm which would place him within the criteria of persecution.”  This statement cannot be accurate; an applicant does not have
to have suffered severe injury or serious harm in the past in order to bring himself within the definition of persecution.  It is
true that the most recognised form of persecution is the infliction of physical harm including torture and kidnapping as best examples
but not the only form. 46.  The applicant must establish he has a well-founded fear at the time his claim is being assessed; good grounds for fearing persecution
in the future.  He must establish that he has a subjective fear of persecution and also that the fear is well-founded in an objective
sense.  Evidence of past persecution is one of the effective means of showing that a fear of future persecution is objectively well-founded.
 If there is a pattern of long-standing persecution, then there is a likelihood that the behaviour will continue.  However, severe
injury or serious harm is not a necessary factual element to establish persecution.  This ground is reasonably arguable on both limbs. 47.  Therefore, having heard this ex parte application and submissions, I find the three grounds are reasonably arguable and I give leave to the applicant to judicial review

any delay in making an application… As long as no prejudice is caused, the courts will not rely on these provisions to deprive
a litigant who has behaved sensibly and reasonably of relief to which he is otherwise entitled”.  Significant factors that require
consideration include the length of delay, the explanation offered for the delay, the merits of the substantive application and the
question of prejudice to the applicant as well as public administration. 43.  In this case, the applicant explains that he was applying for an Anonymity Order from the High Court and also at the same time applying
to the High Court to waive the fee of this application with the help of a solicitor acting on a pro bono basis when the three months expired. He was not sitting back but proactively pursuing this application.  The delay was minimal and
of little prejudice.  As I have decided his application is reasonably arguable, I therefore grant an extension of time for the application

those previously reserved be paid by Ds to P on party and party basis to be taxed if not agreed.  Mr Leung submitted that Ds’ liability
is unarguable and further Mrs Townsend’s witness statement was provided to Ds back in 2015 and yet no action was taken by Ds to
attempt to agree to any items or to provide their own supporting evidence.  As a result, the trial was unnecessarily lengthened. 247.  Although Ds’ liability is unarguable, P did again rely on the Employment Contract and on the 04.05.07 Letter and did not succeed.
 Further, P had to prove its case on quantum.  The original estimated length of trial was 5 days.  The trial eventually lasted 9
days. 248.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I accept that the trial was unnecessarily lengthened by Ds’ conduct and/or
uncompromising attitude during the trial.  I am prepared to order Ds to jointly and severally pay P’s costs of the trial after

and it would be efficient and sufficient for GR to peruse the relevant documents such as skeleton submissions by Chen’s counsel.
Likewise, it would be efficient and sufficient for GR to peruse the skeleton submissions by Ng’s/Daughter’s counsel. I see no
justification (at least on party‑and‑party basis) for solicitors to “settle” counsel’s skeleton submissions. 12.  Sixthly, in relation to Item E, Ng/Daughter claimed counsel’s brief fee of HK$22,400, and Chen proposed HK$15,000. Bearing in
mind it was entirely appropriate to have junior counsel to Mr Chua SC at the substantive hearing (who was familiar with the background
of the substantive applications) to appear for Ng/Daughter for the Variation Summons, and the fact Mr A Tang was called to the bar
in 2011, I find his brief fee to be necessary/proper and reasonable in the circumstances. 13.  Taking into account all of the above matters, and upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary
and its costs reasonable” on the sensible standard of necessity as explained by the Court of Appeal, Ng’s/Daughter’s total

Mr Barnes accepted there was no question of general public interest or importance in the present case. 135.  In all the circumstances, I find there was substantial undue delay with no good reason to justify an extension of time, and there
was no reasonably arguable ground of review. I therefore dismiss (a) the Summons, and (b) MI’s application to extend time for him
to apply for judicial review. That being the case, MI’s application for leave to apply for judicial review falls away as it was

郭卓堅 v. 香港島地方選區選舉主任鄧如欣 [2018] HKCFI 433; HCAL 130/2018 (28 February 2018),"6.  In the absence of full arguments, I prefer to leave open the question of whether a person who is neither a candidate (or prospective
candidate) nor an elector for the relevant constituency is absolutely barred from seeking to challenge an election to return a member
to the Legislative Council by way of judicial review.  I consider that the present application can be disposed of on the simple basis
that it is plain that the remedy of judicial review should, as a matter of discretion, be refused at this stage, because (i) granting
leave to apply for judicial review could have a “most deleterious effect”[1] on the forthcoming By-election scheduled to be held on 11 March 2018, and (ii) the result of the By-election can be challenged afterwards
by Miss Chow herself (being the person most directly and immediately affected by the Decision) or by 10 or more electors entitled
to vote at the By-election (who would obviously have a stronger interest in the matter than the Applicant), by way of an election
petition under Section 62 of the LC Ordinance.  There is nothing in the materials before the court to indicate that there will be
any impediment to such election petition being presented by either Miss Chow or 10 or more electors after the election on 11 March
2018. 7.  In so far as the Applicant is seeking to challenge the Returning Officer’s previous decision that Mr Law was validly nominated
as a candidate at the 2016 Legislative Council Election, the Applicant is way out of time.  There is no good reason to extend time
for the Applicant to raise such late challenge, particularly where Mr Law has since been disqualified from assuming office as member
of the Legislative Council.  I pause to add that the Applicant has not, as a matter of fact, sought any extension of time in his
Form 86.  Further, any suggestion that the Returning Officer somehow violated the requirement contained in the Legislative Council
Oath to uphold the Basic Law is entirely misconceived, since she was not required to take the Legislative Council Oath. 8.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed, with no order as to costs.","and香港島地方選區選舉主任鄧如欣

HKSAR v. LI CHEUNG YIN [2018] HKCFI 581; HCCC 217/2017 (28 February 2018),"16.  I do not believe that the message is capable of being regarded as sufficiently reliable to satisfy the res gestae doctrine.  We do not know anything about the person who sent the message, or what made him (or her) think that they might be able
to get ice from the defendant.  Was that something that they knew themselves?  Or was it something they were told?  And if the latter,
we do not know who the person who told them that was, or what the source of their information was.  Nor do we know whether the defendant
was the intended recipient of the message.  Indeed, Mr Ho, while reluctant to reveal what the defendant’s case would be, told me
that there was an issue about the ownership of the mobile phone, and therefore an issue about who the intended recipient of the message
was.  So there are a few possible explanations for the message to have been sent to a mobile phone in the defendant’s possession
other than that the defendant was believed to be someone from whom ice could be obtained.  And even if the defendant was someone
from whom it was believed that ice could be obtained, there are possible explanations for that belief other than that the defendant
was in fact someone from whom ice could be obtained.  The position might have been different if there had been a number of messages
of the same kind from apparently unconnected people, but for the reasons I have given, I rule that the evidence of this one message
on the mobile phone found in the defendant’s possession is inadmissible. 17.  The question then arises about what to do now. The jury has already heard the evidence.  The options are to direct them to ignore
the evidence and not to hold any of it against the defendant.  Some people might think that that would be asking the jury to perform
mental gymnastics of a kind which would be highly difficult for them to do.  The other option is to discharge the jury and to order
the defendant to be retried.  The prosecution ask me not to take that course, but to give the jury a strong direction to ignore the
evidence.  18.  If the defence had asked me to discharge the jury and order a retrial, I would have been prepared to do that.  However, having considered
the matter carefully, and having taken the defendant’s instructions, Mr Ho is content with a direction to the jury to ignore all
the evidence relating to the message.  That stance is adopted, no doubt, for tactical reasons, and it would not be right for me to
adopt a course of action which deprives the defence of any tactical advantage which has accrued to the defence as a result of the
evidence having been admitted erroneously.  I shall therefore direct the jury to ignore the evidence about the message in its entirety,
ie not just the message itself, but also what the admitted facts said about when the message was sent and what it said, and the evidence
about what certain characters in the message meant.",Date of Ruling: 28 February 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/581.html,"

RE GOLDEN GATE INTERNATIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND NURSERY LTD [2018] HKCFI 641; HCCW 210/2017 (28 February 2018),"6.  A debt which is subject to a contingency which cannot arise if the company is insolvent in my view cannot be admitted to proof.
 The reasons for this are apparent from paras 68 to 71 of Lord Neuberger’s decision in Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (No 4) [2017] UKSC 38; [2017] 2 WLR 1497, the facts of which are to the extent relevant apparent from these paragraphs:  7.  If the contingency cannot arise in the event of the winding up and, therefore, cannot be admitted to proof, it is artificial to
characterise the creditor as a contingent creditor.  The correct analysis in my view is that for the purposes of section 179(1) he
is not a creditor at all.  A creditor must be somebody whose debts can properly be admitted to proof even if the debt is valued at
a nominal amount pending a final determination of its value, which may depend on the occurrence of a contingency.  If the claim cannot
properly be admitted to proof at all, the claim cannot sensibly be characterised as a contingent debt.  In order for the debt to
be contingent, there must be some possibility of the contingency occurring.  If necessarily it cannot if a winding-up order is made,
there is no longer a contingency and, therefore, no longer a contingent debt.  8.  For this reason, I conclude that the petitioner is not a contingent creditor or a creditor at all and, therefore, did not have locus to present the petition, which I will therefore dismiss and make a costs order nisi that the petitioner pays the Opposing Contributory’s costs of the petition, and that the Official Receiver’s costs are paid out

C v. S [2018] HKCFI 390; HCMP 929/2017 (1 March 2018),"52.  As set out in paragraph 14 of PDSL 6, the question of separate representation is a balance between the risk of potential harm to
the child if he has no voice in the proceedings, the risk of adverse effects on a child who is reluctant to be drawn into a parental
dispute and the cost and time burden to the courts which increased representation will bring.  Having weighed up the balance and
having considered the long history of intractable dispute between the parties, notwithstanding Mrs Lam’s recommendation, I have
come to the view that it is in N’s best interests to be separately represented by the OS.  In fact, in my view, the OS may also
be able to assist N in receiving mental health/psychiatric treatment. 53.  In light of the above, I will order N to be separately represented by the OS in these proceedings. 54.

On 23 August 2013, I made a further order which addressed an application by the 2nd respondent that there be an inquiry into the damages caused to the 1st and 2nd respondents by the continuation of the appointment of the provisional liquidators for the period from 2 January 2013 to 1 March 2013.
 The 2nd respondent has brought that application on before me today.  The petitioners have not attended.  3.  The only damages that are sought today are the provisional liquidators’ costs and disbursements for the period from 2 January
2013 to 1 March 2013.  I ordered in my earlier order of 19 March 2013 that the costs of the proceedings during this period be borne
by the petitioners, as I accepted that at least from 2 January 2013 it was no longer necessary for there to be provisional liquidators
given certain undertakings that had been offered by the 2nd respondent. Essentially what I am being asked to do today is, for the same reasons, to direct that the costs that had been incurred
to the Company, the order appointing the provisional liquidators providing as is normal that in the first instance the provisional
liquidators’ costs and disbursements be paid out of the assets of the Company, now be paid by the petitioners. It seems to me that
that is the correct order to make in the circumstances and I will so order. 4.  So far as the costs of today’s application are concerned, it necessarily follows that the petitioners should pay the 2nd respondent’s costs. It seems to me that as the petitioners have made no effort to agree an order, and the 2nd respondent being put to the what should have been unnecessary time and expense of preparing what might have been a contested application,
those costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 1 March 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/492.html,"

AKBANK T.A.S. v. MAINFORD LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 405; HCA 3264/2016 (2 March 2018),"19.  After considering the totality of the evidence, and notwithstanding the limited extent of the direct evidence currently available
as regards the origins of the specific sum of US$218,001.12 currently held in D16’s account with HSBC, I was of the view that the
plaintiff had shown a sufficiently good arguable case to justify the extension of the previous injunction order to D16’s newly
revealed accounts with HSBC and specifically the identified sum of US$218,001.12.  I therefore ordered that the previous injunction
order be amended accordingly. 20.  On D16 revealing the existence of the accounts with HSBC, the solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to D16 solicitors seeking account
and other information to demonstrate the source of the funds in the account.  However, as I have already observed, D16 position in
response was that it is unable to provide any such documentary evidence.  Not surprisingly, this has led to the application of the
plaintiff for a bankers’ book evidence type order in respect of D16’s account with HSBC.  That application was not opposed by
counsel for D16 and I ordered in the terms of the plaintiff’s application save for the amendment of the time period for provision
of information and documents from 14 to 28 days. 21.  I need not deal with the subject of costs in this decision as the parties were able to reach agreement in this regard.","ELITE TALENT LIMITED

of clause 8.2(c) or any other part of the Agreement to which I have been taken, which requires this reading.  Neither is there anything
to suggest that once a daily rate (and the rate used in the invoice was A$1,250) had been agreed Lasmos’s record of days worked
did not remain to be agreed. There is no record, for example, of how many hours work constituted a day’s work or how Lasmos was
to be paid for part of a day.  Neither was there any agreed mechanism for recording or reporting the amount of time spent.  It seems
to me that at this stage it is certainly arguable that the parties’ discussions fell short of arriving at a binding agreement on
fees that results in the claim being for a liquidated debt. 39.  The subsequent contemporaneous communications between the other shareholders are also consistent with an agreement not having been
reached. For example, in an email of 24 September 2015 Lawrence Chin states that he does not recall the US$130,000 payment being
agreed, but would defer to others on this point. He then goes on to suggest that the invoice lacks supporting descriptions of the
services provided and is inadequate.  Mr Chin’s comments are inconsistent with an agreement that the amount of the invoice that
was to be submitted had been reached and his comments read as a genuine record of what he thought at the time.  They were in reply
to an email of 23 September 2015 from Mr Hills, which sought board approval of payment of the invoice, and recommended the payment
of US$130,000 “discussed at the last Board meeting as a progress payment.…”  This also suggests the board had not agreed to pay any particular sum other than the progress payment. 40.

the 2nd defendant, with no additional costs incurred for the finding against him.  This is not correct because a judgment against him is
as I said indispensable given that he was the transferee under the Transfer and until the Judgment the sole owner of the Property.
 The 1st defendant must be liable for the costs incurred to obtain the Judgment against him (jointly and severally with the 2nd defendant in so far as any costs were incurred against them in common).  The fact that no additional costs were incurred is irrelevant. 26.  In so far as Mak Ngun Tai is concerned, in my judgment it is distinguishable.  In a case like the present, the 1st defendant, found to have shared the relevant intention for the Transfer to be set aside, was responsible for the plaintiff’s need
to commence, and to proceed with, the action and, after the withdrawal, whatever was done by the plaintiff to obtain judgment against
him.  In Mak Ngun Tai, however, which was an application for the appointment of an administrator pendate lite, there was no suggestion that the 2nd defendant was responsible for the fact that the application was being made by the plaintiffs, or the need for the application to
proceed to a hearing.  I do not read that judgment as laying down any general rule that a party, having taken a neutral stance, would
not be liable for any costs.  Each case must depend on its own facts and the court must exercise its discretion on costs accordingly. 27.  For the above reasons, I make the following order in place of the costs order made in §63 of the Judgment, namely that the 1st and the 2nd defendants are jointly and severally liable for and do pay the costs of this action to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed.
 I also make an order nisi that the 1st defendant is also to pay the costs of the plaintiff in this application for variation of the costs order.  The plaintiff’s own
costs are to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.",Date of Decision on Costs: 2 March 2018(Stewart Wong SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2018/463.html,"

KPS v. DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 453; HCAL 62/2016 (5 March 2018),"81.  In any event, the DOI assessed the risk of harm to KPS if he returned to India to be low. Likewise, the Adjudicator was not persuaded
that KPS would face any risk of ill-treatment at the hands of MK and his men or at all were he to be refouled and relocated in India.
By reason of the above, the DOI and Adjudicator could not be faulted for not finding for KPS in relation to any psychiatric harm
or mental suffering. 82.  As regards KPS’ suggestion that the DOI and Adjudicator Decisions were unreasonable in that he was attacked and tortured following
which he received serious injuries and hospitalised treatment so the DOI’s assessment regarding the intention of KPS’ kidnappers
and assailants was premised on false logic, I have dealt with the matter of factual findings in paragraphs 49-50 above, and find
such contention unarguable. 83.  In my view, bearing in mind the high degree of scrutiny required, neither the DOI nor the Adjudicator made any reviewable error
in coming to the essential findings/conclusions in their respective decisions. I find they had respectively given sufficient reasons
for coming to those findings/conclusions, which reasons were rational and sound. KPS failed to demonstrate that any of the intended
grounds of review was reasonably arguable. I therefore dismiss KPS’ application for leave to judicially review the DOI and Adjudicator

LAW LAI LAN v. TAMANG PREM CHANDR [2018] HKCFI 536; HCMP 2402/2017 (5 March 2018),"47.  The only truly mitigating factor is his admission of non-compliance with the order at the hearing on 30 November 2017.  Of course,
the facts were such that he could not but to admit.  48.  Mr How asks for an unspecified term of imprisonment.  Recalcitrant as the Respondent is, this is not the worst type of case that
calls for such a draconian measure.  The applicant’s claim in the main action from which this contempt arose is about $3.5 million.
 It is not a proprietary claim and the applicant is not entitled to tracing.  There is nothing to suggest that the applicant would
suffer additional damage if the contempt is not purged.  Some disclosure has, somehow, been made and bank accounts identified, from
which some recourse could be made.  A fixed term imprisonment with liberty to apply for a review upon the contemnor’s purging the
contempt is appropriate. 49.  The contempt, as I have found, was willful and contumelious.  The Respondent’s conduct was recalcitrant.  I consider a starting
point of twelve months’ imprisonment appropriate.  The Respondent’s admission deserves some mitigation, but that is more than
wiped off by the aggravating factor I mentioned above.  Accordingly, I pass a sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment which shall
take into account the time he was remanded in custody pending sentence.  This sentence is to be served consecutively to the sentence
of 28 days’ imprisonment for common assault which he is currently serving.  I also order costs against the Respondent on indemnity
basis.","Date of Judgment:

is a danger of jury tampering.  In Hong Kong, no equivalent provisions exist in our statute books, it may be high time for giving
serious consideration to that.  There is however nothing to prohibit the case from being transferred to the District Court for trial. 42.  The present scenario is not much different from any case where a defendant has asked his friends or followers, whom not knowing
the underlying reasons, to come to court, wearing black clothing and sitting in the public gallery, with the objective of intimidating
either the witness or the jury.  In such a situation, the court will have no hesitation in excluding all these people.  Having said
that, I wish to emphasise that there is no allegation against any persons who were brought into the court by the public relations
firm or consultant and for that matter Mr To Kit. 43.  It came therefore with no surprise that in recent years, when the wealthy and powerful were charged for criminal offences, they
tried all kinds of means and ways to list their cases in the High Court before a jury.  The involvement of public relations firm

SABUZ MOLLAH v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD/ NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 401; HCAL 312/2017 (7 March 2018),"40.  Although there is some merit in the submissions in paragraph 38 above, Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention provides that persecution
has to be “on account of one or more grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political
opinion” and the adjudicator found the alleged assault and any future risk had not been and will not be under any one of those
grounds.  For that and other reasons, the situation fell far short of establishing a persecution risk.  Even if the other reasons
came about through errors, if there was no Refugee Convention ground established then persecution is not a risk.  This would mean
his errors become immaterial and this ground is not reasonably arguable. 41.  In the first incident in late June 2004 when a group of BNP members stormed the applicant’s office and destroyed furniture, the
applicant and other AL members fled immediately unharmed.  Even on the applicant’s own facts, there was no evidence he was their
personal target.  It was a matter of political rivalry.  The following day, the only other described incident of political rivalry
involved a rally of around 3000 to 4000 AL members including the applicant who clashed with a group of BNP members; this led to stones
being thrown, bullets being shot and bombs being thrown. The applicant ran away.  Again, this rally was not about the applicant personally.
 He was later told that a stone he threw seriously injured a senior member of the BNP yet no action has ever been taken against the
applicant or his family about this matter.  The AL have been in power since January 2009. On these facts, the adjudicator correctly
made a finding that he did not face persecution on account of a Convention reason.  He went on to find, in any event, there was State
protection available if there was any risk and internal relocation was a viable option anywhere other than his home district. 42.  I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the adjudicator.  Nor do I see any evidence of procedural unfairness
or a failure to adhere to a high standard of fairness.  The substantive decision did satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was
not Wednesbury unreasonable.  None of the grounds were arguable so as to satisfy the test in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Cheung & Anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676.

done by counsel.  Again, however, that seems to me to be something that the court can take account of in the broad-brush approach.
 The alternative is that the matter goes to taxation with the incurring of yet further expense. 35.  On the whole, I think that this is a case for a summary assessment but, as I have said, given that the court has declined to make
an order on an indemnity basis, each of the factors that has been raised by the 1st defendant are factors that the court is fully entitled to take into account on the paragraph 13 approach to summary assessment. 36.  The amount claimed in total by the plaintiff is $801,191.00.  Taking into account all the matters that have been raised by the 1st Defendant relating to the Statement of Costs, I will summarily assess the costs at $600,000 to be paid by the 1st defendant to the plaintiff.

RE RAD SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES ASIA LTD [2018] HKCFI 610; HCCW 253/2017 (7 March 2018),"5.  There is nothing from the Company, either in the form of contemporaneous emails or letters, or affirmation evidence, which indicates,
and indeed I do not understand it to be the Company’s case, that it has rejected the irradiator.  It seems to me to be quite clear
that the Company has had ample opportunity and time to decide whether or not such problems as may have been identified on 13 April
2017 were sufficiently serious to justify rejecting the irradiator, and having not done so, the Company must be treated as having
accepted the irradiator and therefore is, on the face of the matter, liable to pay the contract price. 6.  The second ground for arguing that the debt is not payable is that the alleged oral agreement to which I have referred.  Mr Hartman
in his affidavits denies that any such agreement was ever reached. There is no reference to it in anything written during the material
periods by either the petitioner or the Company.  It seems to me to be inherently unlikely that the petitioner would have agreed
simply to leave such an expensive device in the Mainland without requiring at least partial payment.  There is an additional matter
which, it seems to me, calls into question both the likelihood of such an agreement ever having been reached and the bona fides of Mr Zhao’s evidence in this regard, namely, that it is the undisputed evidence of the petitioner that it has been told that CEIEC
has paid 90% of the contract price.  Although the petitioner does not know when payment took place, it seems to me that this being
the case is inconsistent with the suggested agreement advanced by the Company as a ground for deferring payment.  7.  In conclusion, it seems to me that a bona fide defence on substantial grounds, which is the criteria that needs to be satisfied by the Company in order to successfully oppose the
petition, has not been demonstrated.  As a consequence, there is clearly more than the statutory minimum required to support the
petition, and I will therefore make the normal winding-up order which will include an order that the Company pays the petitioner’s
costs.  I understand that on 23 February 2018 the petitioner paid HK$250,000 into court by way of security for costs.  I order that
that sum be paid to the petitioner.",Date of Decision: 7 March 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/610.html,"

HKSAR v. LAI CHUN HO [2018] HKCFI 458; [2018] 2 HKC 295; HCCC 213/2016 (8 March 2018),"39.  I certainly appreciate that the Specimen Directions for GNM say nothing about a subjective element.  On the other hand, I had heard
full arguments in Lai Shui Yin and Chow Heung Wing before I decided and confirmed respectively my view that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove the subjective element.  I
had given reasons why I was of the view that the HK situation is different from that of the UK.  I therefore did not follow the exact
wordings of the Specimen Directions for GNM in both Lai Shui Yin and Chow Heung Wing, but made adjustments to the Specimen Directions as required by the particular circumstances of both cases, incorporating the subjective
element. 40.  As to the defence submissions on the relevance of the defendant’s subjective state of mind in GNM cases generally, I do not think
there is any dispute that even in the English cases, the subjective state of mind, if present, can and should be taken into consideration
by the jury.  I have already ruled in Lai Shui Yin that a person who genuinely did not perceive an obvious and serious risk of death should not be exposed to conviction for a serious
crime as manslaughter on the strength of what someone else would have appreciated, therefore it was not enough for the prosecution
to simply rely on the objective reasonable man test, with the judge directing the jury to take into consideration the defendant’s
subjective state of mind both for and against him. 41.  For these reasons, I am not persuaded by the prosecution that I should change my views and reverse my own decision in Lai Shui Yin, confirmed in Chow Heung Wing.",(Judianna Barnes)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/458.html,"

HKSAR v. CHEUNG KA LUN [2018] HKCFI 538; HCCC 265/2017 (9 March 2018),"11.  In respect of the resisting a police officer offences, sentences obviously vary depending on the nature and degree of the offending
involved.  But whatever the circumstances, the courts take very seriously any form of disrespectful behaviour towards a police officer
lawfully carrying out his duties, particularly when such disrespectful behaviour involves acts of violence and aggression.  In such
circumstances, sentences in this kind of case carry a heavy deterrent element.  In the present case, the defendant was arrested by
the police officers and he violently struggled and resisted them, causing some injuries to the officers involved even though such
injuries were of a minor nature.  The approach the courts take in respect of such offences was explained in HKSAR v LIU Lin-feng, CACC 206/2011, 28 February 2012, unreported, at paragraph 55, where the following quoted passage from Secretary for Justice v Ko Wai Kit [2001] HKCA 3; [2001] 3 HKLRD 751, at 758, was relied upon. 12.  This quoted passage should be considered in light of other cases where shorter terms of imprisonment have been imposed where the
nature of the resistance or any resultant injury to the police officer is of a minor nature.  The Court in LIU Lin-feng considered a starting point of 4 ½ months’ imprisonment entirely appropriate where the applicant resisted several police officers
who sustained minor injuries, not dissimilar in nature to the injuries sustained by the police officers in the present case.  I will
adopt the same starting point of 4 ½ months’ imprisonment on each of Counts 2 and 3, which I reduce by one third for the defendant’s
guilty plea, thereby resulting in a sentence on each count of 3 months’ imprisonment.  13.  Taking into account the totality principle, I order that the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 be served concurrently and that 2 months
of the concurrent sentences of 3 months on Counts 2 and 3 be served consecutively to the term of imprisonment of 7 years and 8 months’
imprisonment on Count 1.  This results in a sentence of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/538.html,"

HKSAR v. WONG CHUN YAM [2018] HKCFI 546; [2018] 5 HKC 451; HCMA 494/2017 (12 March 2018),"32.  Neither of the appellant’s grounds of appeal is valid.  33.  The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 34.  In the case, it took the police a substantial period of time to gather evidence, particularly the CCTV footage at various locations.
 Apparently, it also took them considerable time and effort to scrutinise such CCTV footage to reconstruct the entire process of
how the appellants and the other defendants tailed Mr Chu.  Such evidence provided great assistance to the court and was a manifestation
of the high degree of professionalism and impartiality with which the police investigated the case.  The appellant and his accomplices,
whether for political or other reasons, tailed Mr Chu.  Because of their foolish conduct, the police had to mobilise substantial
manpower and material resources to carry out an investigation at the expense of considerable public funds, and the appellant now
has a conviction at a young age.  The appellant and the public should learn a lesson from this case.",Date of Judgment: 12 March 2018(Joseph Yau),Judge of the Court of First Instance,/2018/546.html,"

HKSAR v. YAN SIN MAN [2018] HKCFI 582; HCCC 19/2018 (12 March 2018),"10.  It may well be that the assertion that the defendant had been engaged in drug trafficking at the time of her arrest is implicit from the fact that she had in her possession at that time a notebook and a mobile phone containing the relevant entries
and photographs—on the assumption, of course, that the jury is satisfied that the defendant knew of the entries and the photographs.  But the difficulty for the prosecution is that the truth of that assertion is dependent on the
transactions referred to in the entries in the notebook and the photographs in the mobile phone having taken place—in just the
same way as the betting slips in Or Suen Hong could only have been evidence that the defendant had engaged in bookmaking if the bets purportedly recorded as having taken place had taken place.  They had to have been real transactions
if they were to be evidence of anything other than that the room in which the drugs were found had been the venue at which drug trafficking
had taken place, or as in Or Suen Hong that the room in which the betting slips were found had been the venue at which bookmaking had taken place.  Evidence that these
had been real transactions could not have been given without the prosecution calling the “maker” of the entries or the photographs,
and without such evidence the entries and the photographs are inadmissible for the purpose for which the prosecution proposes to
rely on them on the basis that they contravene the rule against hearsay.  It follows that the entries in the notebook and the photographs
in the mobile phone may not be admitted in the course of the trial. 11.  I have not overlooked what McWalters JA said on this topic at [91] in his separate judgment.  He said: 12.  In the interests of completeness, I should add two things.  First, the Court of Appeal referred to the “maker” of the photographs—as
if the photographs had been taken by someone using the mobile phone.  That is true of the photograph of the receipt, but the prosecution’s
case in fact is that all the other photographs were sent via WhatsApp from the mobile phone to someone who the prosecution is not able to identify.  However, that does not help on how they got onto the mobile
phone in the first place—whether they were sent to the mobile phone by someone or whether they were taken on the mobile phone.  If they had been sent to the mobile phone rather than taken on it, that might have been another reason for holding that the photographs were hearsay.  Secondly,
everything I have said so far about the photographs in the mobile phone does not include the photograph of the receipt for the rent.
However, Mr Andrew Raffell for the prosecution has acknowledged that the prosecution cannot rely on that photograph.  That is because
the Court of Appeal held at [76] that the trial judge should have “directed the jury to disregard entirely the evidence of the
photograph of the receipt” on the basis that it “had no probative value”.",Date of Ruling: 12 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/582.html,"

In conclusion, I have to decide whether the plaintiff’s proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success.  In my view this
is a case which manifestly should go to trial.  The plaintiff’s applications for a strike-out or summary judgment and for a determination
under Order 14A are, in my respectful view, entirely misconceived, and as such have in my view no prospect of success in the Court
of Appeal.  The plaintiff’s application is dismissed.  13.  The order that the court makes is as follows:",Date of Decision: 12 March 2018(Robert Whitehead SC),Recorder of the High Court,/2018/658.html,"

by way of an affirmation from Ng Ka Man Carmen, an executor officer of the TCAB dated 10 January 2018 that a committee is in the
process of drafting new practice directions for the TCAB; a set of draft directions specifically aimed at Adjournment of Scheduled
Hearings due to illness of the Appellant/Petitioner have been considered and discussed in recent meetings in December and January.
 It would appear that the issue is being addressed and does not require the courts to consider a declaration. 19.  I agree with Mr McCoy that the tone of the adjudicator and the failure of the adjudicator to acknowledge what the applicant had
said and deal with it properly and fairly means the adjudicator did not adhere to a high standard of fairness and there was not only
an error of law made but procedural irregularity.  The adjudicator dealt with the applicant’s well‑being in a most perfunctory
manner.  I found merit in Mr McCoy’s grounds and quashed the decision of the TCAB. 20.  I made the following orders on 7 February 2018:",Date of Judgment: 13 March 2018(Amanda Woodcock),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/468.html,"

grounds at paragraphs 40 to 54 of my judgment.  I just quote one main reason given at paragraph 43 of the judgment:  16.  In my judgment, whether a court or jury requires the assistance of an expert in making a decision depends on the facts and evidence

agree with the submission by the respondent that the complaint was unfounded and in my view, it was just a matter of expression and
interpretation by the Magistrate.  There is no doubt that all the Magistrate was trying to say was that the only possible inference
he can draw was employment as there was not even an iota of evidence which indicated any other alternative relationship.  The Magistrate
has not reversed the burden of proof as contended by the appellants.  Accordingly, this ground also fails. 40.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that the there is no substance nor any merit in any ground of appeal advance on behalf of the
two appellants.  The inference that the two appellants were taking employments at the material times was one the Magistrate was fully
entitled to draw in light of the circumstantial evidence in this case.  Despite the able submissions made on the appellants’ behalf,
I find no basis to interfere with the Magistrate’s finding of facts and the conclusion that he has reached.  41.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed. ",Date of Judgment: 14 March 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/534.html,"

not permitted to give opinion on the law.  With the concession made by the Prosecution during the hearing of the submissions, it
then became clear on what basis the Prosecution intended to rely on the GMP guidelines.  As a result of this Court’s ruling on
the limited use of these guidelines, D1 and D2 produced documents relating to GMP guidelines in their defence. 66.  In these circumstances, I do not agree that D1 and D2 had unjustifiably challenged the relevance of the GMP.  D1 and D2 will not
be ordered to pay the Prosecution’s costs on this ground.",(Judianna Barnes)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/526.html,"

HKSAR v. CHAN KWUN CHUNG [2018] HKCFI 528; HCCC 437/2015 (15 March 2018),"18.  Unlike counsel for D1 and D3, counsel for D2 never submitted any skeleton argument on this issue, it was only after counsel for
D1 had finished his submission, when called upon by this Court, that counsel for D2 informed this Court that he would adopt the submission
of D1’s counsel.  That being the case, even if this Court were to order the Prosecution to pay costs, it would have been extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for this Court to assess the amount of award without any reference to actual work done. 19.  As to the question of “delay”, I would mention in passing here that although counsel for D2 did not indicate D2’s intention
to ask for costs against the Prosecution when the Prosecution made its intention known (on 13 December 2017), it was made known to
this Court soon enough (on 18 December 2017).  I do not consider such a delay significant enough to affect my discretion in relation
to the costs application. 20.  For these reasons the Prosecution will not be ordered to pay costs to D2.",(Judianna Barnes)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/528.html,"

and properly considered the issues raised by the appellant. The magistrate was not “plainly wrong” in his finding as to credibility

GLORY SKY FINANCE LTD v. CHEN JIANHUA AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 578; HCMP 2482/2014 (15 March 2018),"79. For the reasons given above, I find that the plaintiff has regularly been flouting proper court procedures.  Given such conduct,
and having considered the plaintiff’s pleadings and affirmations, I am of the view that the plaintiff has demonstrated a lack of
will to litigate its claim as economically and expeditiously as reasonably possible in accordance with the overriding objective.
 I emphasize that I have not found bad faith.  It was want of good faith as explained above.  But such conduct should not go unpunished.
 The defendants should also be protected from such conduct.  I have also found, on the strength of the evidence disclosed, that the
plaintiff’s pleaded case has no real prospect of succeeding.  I have weighed in the change in the defendants’ pleaded case in
respect of the title deeds.  It does not provide any excuse to the plaintiff for any of its conduct in the past.  It may however
be relevant to the issue of quantum, which I will come to.  In all the circumstances, and having undertaking the weighing exercise
above, I am satisfied that this is one of those exceptional cases in which an order for payment-in ought to be made. 80. I have dealt with Mr Cheuk’s first affirmation above.  He deposed that the defendants’ estimated cases down to trial will be
about HK$3 to 3.5 million.  There is no evidence from the plaintiff that either it cannot afford it, or the estimates were otherwise
objectionable.  On the other hand, I note the change in the defendants’ pleaded case in respect of the title deeds.  They will
have to be responsible for any time and costs wasted.  On the issue of quantum, Ms Yu has brought to my attention Allen v Bloomsbury.  As observed by Kitchin J therein, the Court can only do the best one can.  Having considered the facts, and doing the best I can,
I order that the plaintiff should within 14 days from the day hereof pay into court the sum of HK$1,500,000, which represent about
43% or 50% of the costs estimates, depending upon whether the sum of HK$3 million or HK$3.5 million is adopted.  In ordering that
amount, I have also considered the amount in dispute, as I am required to do by Order 2, rule 3.  This sum of HK$1.5 million is not
disproportionate to the amount in dispute.  I so order. 81. At the end of the hearing, I indicated that I will invite submissions before making any order for costs.  I direct that the defendants
should file and serve their submissions on costs within 10 days from the date hereof, and the plaintiff within 10 days thereafter
upon receipt.","“ … an order will not be appropriate in every case where a party has a weak case. The weakness of a party’s case

TIGER RESORT ASIA LTD v. KAZUO OKADA AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 472; HCA 3017/2017 (16 March 2018),"29.  The authorities mentioned above have stated that the power for inspection under section 21 should be exercised with great caution.
 I agree.  The privacy of the account holder, and banker/customer confidence have to be respected.  I have indeed approached the
application with great caution. I have taken into account the fact that neither the 4th defendant norSkyrise has been served at this stage.  I have on the other hand considered carefully the evidence as set out above,
which included an Investigation Report prepared by the Special Investigation Committee set out by UE.  I have considered the directions
of the remittances or transfers involved, the amounts of those sums, and their time proximity.  On the face of pleadings and as supported
by the affirmatory evidence before me, there is a clear prima facie case of breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the 1st defendant, and knowing receipt or assistance by the other defendants (including Skyrise).  The allegations are serious, and the total
amount involved was substantial. The records which the plaintiff are seeking to inspect are highly relevant.  The scope of the order
which the plaintiff is now seeking has been narrowed down and specifically defined. I have also taken into account the neutral stance
adopted by 1st defendant.  There is no evidence suggesting that the 1st defendant, the 4th defendant or Skyrise would suffer any damage on top of the limited infringement of their banker / client confidence.  I am in all
the circumstances satisfied that an order in terms of the summons as has been narrowed down ought to be made.  30.  The discussions above are confined to the limb of the application under section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance.  Given my conclusion expressed above, there is no need for me to consider the other limb of the application under the inherent jurisdiction
of the court.  I will just add this.  That jurisdiction to order disclosure by a third party is well established.  It is both wider
than section 21 of the Evidence Ordinance (in the sense that it is not confined to banker’s records), and at the same time narrower (in the sense that it is a power developed
in aid of proprietary or tracing claims) - see Norwich Pharmacal Company v Customs & Excise Commissioners [1973] UKHL 6;  [1974] AC 133 and Bankers Trust Company v Shapira [1980] 1 WLR 124.  Some specific limits on that jurisdiction have also been developed—see Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim (No 5) [1992] 2 All ER 911, A Co v B Co [2002] HKCFI 1080; [2002] 3 HKLRD 111, and CTO (HK) Ltd v Li Man Chiu  [2002] HKCFI 591; [2002] 2 HKLRD 875.  In the present case, the plaintiff’s claim is a proprietary one involving tracing.  The evidence in my view demonstrates a real
prospect that the information sought may lead to the location or preservation of assets to the claim.  The order sought is specific.
 The balance tips in favour of me exercising my discretion granting the order.  If required, I would also have granted the application
pursuant this common law jurisdiction which the courts possess. 31.  I grant the application as narrowed down.",Date of Reasons for Decision: 16 March 2018(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/472.html,"

RE JAMES CHOR CHEUNG WONG [2018] HKCFI 585; [2018] 2 HKLRD 284; HCB 1048/2017 (16 March 2018),"11.  The petitioner denied there was any oral agreement to jointly purchase the property.  He accepted that the debtor contributed $630,000
to enable him to complete the purchase but disputed the nature of that contribution.  His case is that upon his return from Australia,
he wanted to purchase a property.  He asked his mother, who has migrated to Australia, for a loan.  The mother agreed and instructed
his elder brother to give him the money.  His elder brother was executor of their father’s estate which included a property in
Catchick Street to be inherited by the mother.  When the mother emigrated to Australia in 1983, she authorised the brother to sell
the property.  His brother sold the property in 1992 for $750,000 and paid the mother $180,000 holding the balance of $570,000 pending
her further instruction.  Later, with the mother’s consent, the brother used some of her money together with his own to jointly
invest in a rental property with the debtor.  In December1993, that rental property was sold for a profit.  His brother’s share
was $837,787.10 which was kept by the debtor. When the mother agreed to lend money to the petitioner, the elder brother told the
debtor to transfer $570,000 to the petitioner’s bank account.  Thus the sum of $570,000 was the mother’s money and not the debtor’s.
 The petitioner’s case is not supported by any documentary evidence.  The sum of $570,000 which he alleged was his own money borrowed
from his mother for the purchase of the property is at odd with the documented payment by the debtor of the sum of $630,000 to complete
the purchase of the property.  12.  On balance, the petitioner does not appear to have a credible defence to the debtor’s claim in HCA 1676/2006.  In other words,
the debtor appears to have a good counterclaim or cross-claim against the petitioner exceeding the petitioning debt.  On this alternative
case, the debtor has shown that the petitioning debt is disputed on substantial ground. 13.  For the above reasons, the petition is dismissed with costs to the debtor.",Date of Decision: 16 March 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/585.html,"

on the Internet except for section 161 of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap 200, and the established criminal offences that are normally available. Section 161 concerns “access” to a computer with criminal or dishonest intent. More particularly, there does not seem to be any statutory,
regulatory, or administrative provisions delineating legal obligations and responsibilities on owners and operators of social mediums
and social networking sites. 46.  The owners and operators of social mediums and social networking sites in which criminal activities take place bear greater responsibility
for the enforcement of the law in its most fundamental terms.  From what I have been told, it seems that they are not doing enough
to prevent and report crime or protect the young and vulnerable.  Improper and criminal conduct on the Internet should not be the
sole responsibility of the law enforcement agencies or relevant government departments or bodies concerned with the protection and
welfare of the public.  The operators and owners of social mediums and social networking sites also have an important role to play.
 47.  As we have warning signs on our streets and products alerting us to potential hazards or dangers, or reminding us of the law or
of our legal responsibilities, it would seem that at the very least we should have such warning signs in cyberspace where required.
 This is but one of many measures that may be available to address the problem.  Solving this problem will not be easy but it needs
to be addressed, and by appropriate persons and bodies that can make an informed and constructive set of recommendations that hopefully
will deal with and arrest the increasing victimisation of the young and vulnerable on the Internet.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/604.html,"

was on them to prove Ds’ contempt beyond reasonable doubt, bearing in mind Ps’ case throughout was that the Gift was a sham and
that Mr Chun was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Chung Shing HK and the 2 Mainland subsidiaries.  Although the Fung Report was
deficient and Ds did not provide confirmation of any matters as required under the 17.08.15 Order, Ps should have been aware that
committal should be a last resort.  They should have considered other alternatives rather than proceeding with the contempt proceedings
against Ds which turned out to be fruitless.  In fact, in the 18.11.16 Judgment, this Court found that in light of the Receivership
Order, there was an alternative way or a viable alternative for Ps to procure the necessary information through the Receivers appointed
under the Receivership Order[13]. As set out in the 18.11.16 Judgment, this Court ultimately found that Ps failed to discharge the burden on them to prove that Ds

WADDINGTON LTD v. CHAN CHUN HOO THOMAS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 580; HCA 3291/2003 (19 March 2018),"33.  Mr Richard Millet QC’s opinion is that, as a matter of BVI law and under the BVI Court Order:- 34.  Even I were to admit the Plaintiff’s expert evidence and accept the above propositions as a matter of BVI law, it would not affect
my conclusion on the Third Disclosure Application, because the question that I have to decide is not whether the 5th Defendant is acting within the powers conferred by the BVI Court Order, or its directors have actual or ostensible authority, to
oppose the application, but whether I should exercise my discretion to order RSRB to disclose the information and documents sought
by the Plaintiff.  I would have come to the same conclusion with or without the participation of the 5th Defendant.  I would only add that, as stated by the Court of Appeal, the 5th Defendant is not bound, at least as a matter of Hong Kong law, to adopt a neutral stance in respect of interlocutory applications
that may directly concern or affect its interest (see paragraph 24 above).  I do not consider the 5th Defendant to be acting improperly in resisting the present application by the Plaintiff. 35.

郭卓堅 v. 鄭泳舜 [2018] HKCFI 593; HCAL 415/2018 (19 March 2018),"6.  On the evidence before the court, there is, I consider, no proper basis to contend that DAB is a party or organization which advocates
for the independence of Hong Kong from the Peoples’ Republic of China.  The words “民主建港” in the full name of DAB in
Chinese cannot be taken in isolation to mean that DAB advocates for the formation of Hong Kong as an independent state or country
through democracy.  In order to discover the objects, purposes or intentions of a political party, one ought to consider the founding
articles and/or manifesto of the party as well as the words and conduct of that party.  The Applicant has singularly failed to adduce
any relevant evidence on those matters.  In any event, the words “民主建港”, in their natural and ordinary meaning, mean
only the building up or advancement of Hong Kong through democracy.  It also seems to me to be obvious that the banner as shown on
the photograph, in so far as it refers to DAB as “民主建國聯盟”, is a mistake. 7.  There is one other matter that I should mention.  The Applicant’s address as stated in the Form 86 is in Cheung Chau Island. 
It would appear that he was not an elector entitled to vote at the By-election for the Kowloon West Geographical Constituency.  It
is questionable whether he has standing to make the present application.  In the absence of full arguments, I shall leave open the
question of whether a person who is neither a candidate (or prospective candidate) nor an elector for the relevant constituency has
standing to challenge, by way of judicial review, the qualification of a person to hold office as a member of the Legislative Council
for that constituency.  I consider that the present application can be disposed of on the simple basis that the proposed application
for judicial review is not reasonably arguable. 8.  Accordingly, the application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed, with no order as to costs.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/593.html,"

grounds relied upon for the setting aside, as the 2nd Defendant has sought to argue to be possibly applicable. 8.

If an appellant appeals pursuant to section 113, section 114 states that the appellant shall give his notice of appeal in writing to the magistrates’ clerk within 14 days after his conviction,
or the order or determination by the magistrate.  The written notice specified in section 114 refers to Form 101 and 102 by stating “(See Forms 101, 102)”.  Forms 101 and 102 are however headed “notice of appeal to a judge against conviction and sentence” respectively.  Therefore,
it appears even for an appeal against order or determination, Form 101 and 102 are the proper forms under the Magistrates Ordinance. 77.  I am aware that under section 80 of the CPO, of Part IV of the CPO, the term “sentence” includes any court order in dealing with an offender, including a hospital
order.  Also, section 83M & 83N are specifically provided for an appeal against a section 75 finding of disability.  However, the section does not apply to a magistrate’s section 75 determination (section 83M(4)).

梁銳成 v. 香港區域法院 [2018] HKCFI 597; HCAL 418/2018 (20 March 2018),"3.  As can be seen from the December Decision, the Applicant advanced a total of 8 proposed grounds of appeal.  The Deputy Judge dismissed
the Applicant’s application for leave to appeal.  Paragraph 8 of the December Decision related to the 1st to 5th proposed grounds of appeal.  The Deputy Judge considered that those grounds sought to challenge findings of fact made by him.  It
was in that context that the Deputy Judge stated that generally speaking, the Court of Appeal would seldom overturn findings of fact
made by a trial judge. 4.  If the Applicant is not satisfied with the Deputy Judge’s December Decision refusing to grant him leave to appeal, he may make
a further application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  It is an improper use of the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction
in judicial review to seek to challenge a determination of the District Court refusing leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  Further,
judicial review only lies against a decision or order made by a person or body who is amenable to judicial review, but not against
a sentence or statement, or the meaning or implications of a sentence or statement, in a judgment given by a judge sitting in the
District Court. 5.  For the above reasons, the proposed application for judicial review is not reasonably arguable.  The application for leave to apply
for judicial review is therefore dismissed, with no order as to costs.","and香港區域法院

HUNING IMPORT &AMP; EXPORT CO LTD v. HUNING LTD [2018] HKCFI 611; HCA 1228/2014 (20 March 2018),"140.  Throughout the years, HL’s very substantial debt of about $8 million was gradually reduced to $1,227,013 by accounting manipulations.
 In 2004, a very profitable logistic business was created forto serve HIECL which HIECL could have operated on its own.  By consciousdecision,
HIECL passed a resolution to pay HL exorbitant handling charges of $280,000 per year for the use of its banking facilities which
it could also have obtained by mortgaging the two car parking spaces and use of trust receipts facilities.  A very substantial debt
of $4,704,868.64 was treated as having been repaid by accounting manoeuvre without HL or any of its four directors contributing funds
to make the payment.  These accounting manoeuvres only brought about internal reallocation of assets within two companies.  They
served no commercial purpose except to reduce HL’s debtowed to HIECL.  141.  Despite the substantial debt, HL with its banking facilitieswas used as the treasury of the family business. The assets of HL were
used freely for the purpose of HIECL, including funds and trading-in of HL’s Toyota Alphard.  The logistic business was then transferred
to HIECL in 2007 for no consideration, shortly before the split, to insulate that asset from possible execution in a pending litigation.
 This shows that the assets of the two companies are treated as common or mutual assets.  Though the two companies were separate
legal entities, all these indicate that they formed an integral part of the same family business.  If they were truly separate entities,
HIECL could have allowed HL to be wound up in 1998 on failing to pay compensation to the property developer.  From the accounting
treatment of the accounts of these two companies and Chui’s own evidence, I find that until the split, these two companies were
operated as integral parts of one family business.  The debt incurred in 1998 was also the debt of the family business.  142.  When HL’s debt owing to HIECL is viewed against the above background, I have no difficulties to draw the inference that from the
time it was created in 1998, there was no intention that it shall be repaid as if it were a debt contracted at arms’ length.  All
repayments since the creation ofthe debt were just accounting manipulations or internal asset redistribution for business purposes,
such as bookkeeping or tax avoidance.  In the course of discussion about the split, Joe readily agreed to HIECL waiving the debt.
 His agreement is another confirmation of this common intention.  As for HL’s acknowledgment of the debt in its audited report
for the year ended 31 March 2009, Chung Yee explained that he was bound to make the acknowledgement because the debt could not be
removed save by synchronized act of both companies.  Obviously, HIECL was not prepared to take synchronized action.  Indeed, it even
sought to enforce the debt.  I accept his explanation.  Accordingly, I find that the common intention of HL and HIECL was and has
always been that the debt need not be repaid.  For the above reason, HIECL’s claim is dismissed with costs.","Total:

HUNING IMPORT &AMP; EXPORT CO LTD v. HUNING LTD [2018] HKCFI 611; HCA 1228/2014 (20 March 2018),"140.  Throughout the years, HL’s very substantial debt of about $8 million was gradually reduced to $1,227,013 by accounting manipulations.
 In 2004, a very profitable logistic business was created forto serve HIECL which HIECL could have operated on its own.  By consciousdecision,
HIECL passed a resolution to pay HL exorbitant handling charges of $280,000 per year for the use of its banking facilities which
it could also have obtained by mortgaging the two car parking spaces and use of trust receipts facilities.  A very substantial debt
of $4,704,868.64 was treated as having been repaid by accounting manoeuvre without HL or any of its four directors contributing funds
to make the payment.  These accounting manoeuvres only brought about internal reallocation of assets within two companies.  They
served no commercial purpose except to reduce HL’s debtowed to HIECL.  141.  Despite the substantial debt, HL with its banking facilitieswas used as the treasury of the family business. The assets of HL were
used freely for the purpose of HIECL, including funds and trading-in of HL’s Toyota Alphard.  The logistic business was then transferred
to HIECL in 2007 for no consideration, shortly before the split, to insulate that asset from possible execution in a pending litigation.
 This shows that the assets of the two companies are treated as common or mutual assets.  Though the two companies were separate
legal entities, all these indicate that they formed an integral part of the same family business.  If they were truly separate entities,
HIECL could have allowed HL to be wound up in 1998 on failing to pay compensation to the property developer.  From the accounting
treatment of the accounts of these two companies and Chui’s own evidence, I find that until the split, these two companies were
operated as integral parts of one family business.  The debt incurred in 1998 was also the debt of the family business.  142.  When HL’s debt owing to HIECL is viewed against the above background, I have no difficulties to draw the inference that from the

There is an issue of a delay of two weeks in respect of the 1st appeal decision; the Form 86 was filed on 15 March 2017. The legal principles for extension of time have been set out in AW v Director of Immigration & anor CACV 63/2015 3 November 2015, at paragraph 27, 38.  In this case, the applicant explains that he was applying for an Anonymity Order from the High Court and also at the same time applying
for legal aid with the help of a solicitor acting on a pro bono basis.  He was not sitting back but proactively pursuing this application.  The delay was minimal and of little prejudice.  As I
have decided his application is reasonably arguable, I therefore grant an extension of time for the application for leave to apply
for judicial review. 39.  Therefore, having heard this ex parte application and submissions, I find the four grounds are reasonably arguable and I grant leave to the applicant to judicial review

RE XIAO ZHIYONG [2018] HKCFI 522; HCB 873/2017 (21 March 2018),"27.  Despite his denial, it is inherently improbable that he had never bothered to take a look at that statutory demand after receiving
it or in the course of consulting and giving instructions to his lawyers.  It is even more unlikely that he would not have been given
some explanation by his lawyers as to what a statutory demand was, what its legal significance was and what he should do about it.
 Yet, Mr Xiao told this court he did not look at the statutory demand nor did anyone explain it to him.  He also told this court
he could not remember whether he and his secretary brought the statutory demand to see his lawyers or whether his lawyers told him
what the statutory demand was.  In so far as Mr Xiao wishes to bolster up his counsel’s alternative case that, in any event, he
did not understand what Mr Cheng meant when he said “係statutory demand” and that he had no knowledge of the nature of the document
that Mr Cheng handed to him, he fails. 28.  To conclude, this court is satisfied that on 18 November 2016, Mr Xiao was personally served with the statutory demand.  His opposition
to the Petition fails. 29.  There shall be a usual bankruptcy order against Mr Xiao and an order nisi that costs be to the Petitioner, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for counsel.",(Peter Ng)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/522.html,"

TOHKOH JUSHI CO LTD v. THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 656; HCMP 184/2018 (21 March 2018),"1.  In proceedings HCA 2014/2017, the applicant, a company incorporated in Japan, claims that a Japanese businessman fraudulently misrepresented
to it that an order had been placed for the purchase of equipment, when in truth no such order had been placed. That had induced
the applicant to pay sums in excess of 400 million Japanese yen, which is about HK$28 million, to another company in Japan, and those
sums were eventually paid into the bank accounts in Hong Kong of two companies incorporated in Hong Kong. By this application for
a Norwich Pharmacal order, the applicant applies for an order requiring the bank in which the two accounts are maintained to produce various documents
relating to those accounts, so that it can discover whether the funds are still in those accounts, and if not, to whom they have
been transferred. 2.  So far as I can tell, and Ms Jacqueline Chan for the applicant agrees, what is sought is a Norwich Pharmacal order in the standard form, though unusually perhaps, judgment has already been given, admittedly by default, against one of the
two companies for the whole sum which the applicant claims to have been defrauded of.  The bank does not contest the application.
    3.  I am satisfied that the requirements for the making of a Norwich Pharmacal order have been met in this case. There is cogent and compelling evidence which demonstrates that serious tortious conduct has taken
place.  The order is very likely to reap substantial and worthwhile benefits for the applicant, in that it will be in a much better
position to trace its funds.  And the order is drafted in such a way as to make the production sought no more than is reasonably
necessary to assist the applicant in discovering the whereabouts of its funds.  I therefore make the order sought in paragraphs 1-6
of the originating summons, with the minor drafting amendments I have made to it and to the schedule to it. ",Date of Decision: 21 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/656.html,"

Clearly the principle of res judicata applies in this case; once a matter is judicially decided it is finally decided.  This doctrine bars re‑litigation of matters that
have already been judged on its merits or its substance.  This application has been decided by a court already, it is therefore finally
resolved and cannot be determined again, unless on appeal.  The applicant cannot be allowed to abuse the process in this manner because
that is what it is, an abuse; the time has come to accept he has no further recourse in this court on this basis.   7.  Although the applicant has requested an oral hearing in this 2nd application, I take the view that this abuse of process means I can ignore that request and proceed to deal with this summarily and
without a hearing. After all, I suspect the intention of the applicant in filing a 2nd application is to buy time and if I take the time to fix an oral hearing which will require a certain amount of time to arrange in
the court diary then that is playing into the applicant’s hand. Hence, my decision, despite the request, to deal with this expeditiously
and on the papers. This application is accordingly dismissed. 8.  This applicant is not alone in his abuse of the process.  There have been a number of other applicants who have filed 2nd applications in this manner recently.  The principle of res judicata will apply to them; these applications are an abuse of the process and will not be tolerated.

XU BEI v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 636; HCMP 1200/2017 (22 March 2018),"18.  Under such circumstances, there could be no question about rectification of the Companies Register in relation to these matters.
 The only question is about removal of the documents filed by SIL and SRML.  Section 42(4) provides that the court must not order the removal of any information unless it is satisfied that: 19.  If a document showing the rectification is filed in the Companies Register, the continuing presence of the documents filed by the
Unauthorized Directors as such would not cause material damage to the Company.  However, I accept the applicant’s argument that
these documents should be viewed against the scheme as a whole.  They were filed pursuant to an elaborate scheme to extinguish the
shares of the lawful owners and to exclude the Original Directors from management of the Company.  The continuing presence of these
documents might cause intangible damage to the Company.  Investors, lenders and people dealing with the Company might view the propriety
of the conduct of the Company and its directors with suspect and might be weary of their authority as its directors and officers
representing the Company.  People intending to deal with the Company might be deterred bythe sight of these documents and might speculate
if there is anything untowardgoing on in the Company or within its management.  There is a real risk that material damage to the
Company might result by keeping these documents in the Companies Register.  The documents are fraudulent and created with intent
to deceive.  They should never have been registered and kept in the Companies Register and should cease to continue to be kept there.
 On the other hand, I cannot see how SIL, SRML or any other person could arguably have any interest in the continuing appearance
of these inaccurate or forged documents and the inaccurate information contained therein in the Companies Register.  The balance
is in favour of their removal than rectification of the information in the Register. 20.  Accordingly, I make an order that the Registrar of Companies do remove the nine documents stated in paragraph 1 of the originating

CLA ENGINEERING LTD v. DBS BANK (HONG KONG) LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 626; HCMP 273/2018 (23 March 2018),"30.  I am prepared to abridge CLA’s time for serving its inter partes summons, because there is no reason to suppose that it was not just overlooked.  I assume that CLA’s legal team thought that the
issue of the originating summons returnable on 16 March was sufficient.  In any event, no prejudice was suffered by Leighton.  Mr
Zimmern was able to marshal all his arguments despite having insufficient notice of the filing of the summons.  The same applies
to the amendment of the summons.  I give leave for the summons to be amended.  I imagine that the desirability of claiming the alternative
relief was only appreciated when Mr Kat joined CLA’s legal team, and again Mr Zimmern was able to deal with the amendment. 31.  However, for the reasons I have endeavoured to give, I discharge the order made by Deputy Judge To, and I dismiss CLA’s applications
for (a) a new order in the terms of the previous one or (b) an order in the terms of the alternative relief sought by CLA.  At the
conclusion of the hearing, I continued the order of Deputy Judge To until judgment on the summonses before me was handed down in
order to maintain the status quo for the time being.  It goes without saying that the continuation of the order for these few days does not affect the dismissal of
CLA’s applications. 32.  I turn to costs.  At present I see no reason why CLA should not pay to Leighton its costs of and occasioned by both summonses, to
be taxed if not agreed, and I make an order nisi to that effect. However, I am not inclined to order that those costs be taxed on the indemnity basis.  There is no reason to think
that this was a deliberate attempt to steal an unfair march on Leighton.  On the contrary: there is every reason to suppose that
there was here a genuinely, albeit misguided, belief that there was nothing more to disclose than what was being disclosed. ",Date of Judgment: 23 March 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/626.html,"

CHUN SANG PLASTICS CO LTD v. COMMISSIONER OF POLICE AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 661; [2018] 2 HKLRD 511; HCA 2278/2008 (23 March 2018),"101.  It was obvious from the nature of the plaintiff’s allegations against the police action that complete disclosure was required
of all statements, records and reports made as a consequence of police activity between 8/9 October 2008 to the point when the police
were ultimately forced to release the containers.  Up to the fifth day of this seven-day trial that had not taken place.  When the
plaintiff’s solicitors gave notice by letter dated 26 February 2018 — almost a decade after the material events — that the
police were to provide copies of all reports, statements etc and produce the originals at trial, they were met with the following
reply from the Department of Justice, which I set out verbatim, in a letter also dated 26 February 2018: 102.  The department’s comment about the lateness of the request is irrelevant.  Its obligation dated from the discovery stage of this
action, years ago.  True it is that a suspicious, mistrustful legal representative of the plaintiff might have been alerted to the
serious deficiency on the defendants’ part — and in my judgment entitled to be so, especially in the light of the subsequent
behaviour of the police and the Department of Justice — but it might equally have been the case that the police failed abysmally
to do things properly and in accordance with regulations and proper practice, as part of a cover-up, or, equally to be condemned,
total disregard for individual rights and common-sense.  I had cause to call in question the department’s sense of what is fair
and good sense in a decision I made in Chan Chuen Ping v Commissioner of Police [2013] HKCFI 1915; [2014] 1 HKLRD 142 (19 November 2013), as yet unreported. 103.  This current instance demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the requirements of litigation as well as individual entitlements
and nothing has been learnt from my decision referred to, or even the basic requirements of civil procedure.  The consequence was
that two whole days were lost whilst the documents were supplied and copied.  Even the defendants’ own counsel was unaware of their
existence.[1] As it transpired none of the documents made any difference to the nature and substance of the case against the defendants, but simply
recorded the consistent and persistent steps to keep the containers away from the plaintiff until eventually and belatedly all of
them were handed over to the plaintiff, though not without intervening traumas and further obstruction.","Containers 5, 6, 7 and 8:

the accused arraigned in his absence.   71.  The accused in the present case was properly charged and brought before the Court.  An indictment was filed against him charging
him with an indictable offence.  He was granted bail which allowed him to return and reside in Australia but on condition and on
his undertaking to return to Hong Kong for trial.  Strict adherence to the legal obligations on an accused by statute or court order
is fundamental to the administration of justice.  There are no exceptional or extenuating circumstances in the present case that
do not require the physical presence of the accused at his arraignment.  72.  In light of the foregoing, the application is therefore refused. ",Date of Ruling: 26 March 2018(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/688.html,"

KWOK SIN HO v. WA KWOK ALSO KNOWN AS KWOK WA [2018] HKCFI 612; HCA 903/2014 (28 March 2018),"179.  To conclude, it is my finding that more probable than not that D had paid for the Purchase Costs, namely a sum totaling HK$28,688
and this is the extent of his payments, and I find all other amounts, whether monthly mortgage instalments, early repayments towards
principal of the Mortgage Loan, Discharge, or Ongoing Expenses were made by P.  Ms Leong and Mr Chan agreed that the total purchase
price plus the miscellaneous expenses was HK$268,563.15 and thus the amount of HK$28,688 paid by P was about 10.68%. 180.  I therefore find that the Property has been held by P and D in joint names on trust as to 89.32% for P, and 10.68% for D.  D should
bear 10.68% the expenses of the rates and government rent since date of completion of the purchase of the Property and should continue
to bear 10.68% of such expenses and any future maintenance expenses relating to the Property but excluding management fees and utilities
which should be borne by the occupier, and in this case P. 181.  As P is largely the successful party, D should pay P’s costs of this action, to be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations, if not agreed.

made out.  Although I would readily accept that the applicant is of sufficient eminence and ability to be suitable for admission
in an appropriate case, and that (on the basis that I was assured that all three counsel previously engaged would continue to be
instructed for the appeal) there is no reason to think that the strength and development of the local bar would be adversely affected
by her admission, these negative factors are insufficient to justify the making of an order for admission in the absence of any positive
public interest reason for doing so. 24.  I therefore dismissed the application, and in accordance with the usual practice, made no order as to costs.",IN THE MATTER of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap 159) of the Laws of Hong Kong(Aarif Barma),Justice of Appeal,/2018/689.html,"

In respect of the costs of the hearing before Master K H Hui, as I have allowed the part of the appeal in respect of the 2nd and 6th defendants,I reduce the costs which the plaintiff was ordered by Master Hui’s Order to paid by two-fifths, so that it becomes HK$22,200. 27.  In respect of the costs of the present appeal, Mr Chan sought summary assessment.  I have considered the Statement of Costs submitted to me.  The sum of HK$71,853 is claimed.  I have considered the nature of the appeal,
which is not complex.  I note also that some works were done by Principal, Assistant Solicitors and Clerk, which necessarily involved
some duplication.  I rule that an appropriate amount would be HK$45,000.  I so order. 28.  I order further that the total costs of $67,200 should be paid within 28 days from the day hereof.",Date of Decision: 29 March 2018(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/685.html,"

dated 23 March 2018. 48.  On the question of costs, the applicable principles as set out in the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal in Leung Kwok Hung v President of the Legislative Council (No 2) [2014] HKCFA 104;  (2014) 17 HKCFAR 841, at paragraph 17, are well settled, and do not have to be repeated here. In the present case, I consider that the Applicant ought
to bear the costs of Mr Au and the Returning Officer because the present application is thoroughly ill -conceived, the Applicant
does not have sufficient standing to pursue the present application for judicial review, and the attendance of Mr Shieh and Mr Mok
on behalf of Mr Au and the Returning Officer respectively has been of material benefit to the court in determining the leave application.

Before: Hon L Chan J in Court



Date of Hearing: 9 April 2018
Date of Judgment: 9 April 2018

_______________
J U D G M E N T
_______________
1.  By an amended creditor’s bankruptcy petition, the petitioner seeks an adjudication of the debtor as a bankrupt.
2.  The debtor, Mr Yip, opposes the petition by a document entitled “[t]he grounds to show cause”, produced as Exhibit 1 to an affidavit
filed on 14 February 2018. 
3.  He filed another affidavit on 27 March 2018, exhibiting another document called “[r]evised cause against bankruptcy petition”.
 He confirmed to me this morning that he only relied on the grounds in the second document as the grounds in the first documents
are also contained in the second. 
4.  The ground of the amended petition is set out in its paragraph 2.  It is based on the judgment I made on 30 June 2015 in HCA 356/2006
requiring Mr Yip to pay the petitioner US$350,000 or its Hong Kong dollar’s equivalent at the time of payment with interest at
2.5 per cent above the best lending rate of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, from 9 April 2009 until judgment,
and thereafter at judgment rate until payment, and costs of the petitioner in that action to be taxed. 
5.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the amended petition further say that the debt abovementioned is a liquidated sum payable immediately and
the debtor appeared to be unable to pay it.  The petitioner had served a statutory demand dated 25 October 2017 on the debtor, which
demand has not been complied with, or set aside, and no application for its setting-aside is outstanding.
6.  I held in paragraphs 343 to 350 of the judgment in HCA 356/2009 that the debtor had practised various misrepresentations on the
petitioner, which caused the petitioner to pay the debtor US$350,000 for the purchase of the controlling shares of a US corporation
called Tabatha V Inc.  I further held that the petitioner had rescinded the contract for his purchase of the Tabatha V shares.  He
sought repayment of the US$350,000 by the debtor.  He also undertook to the court to take all steps necessary to revert the Tabatha
V shares registered in his name back to the transferor of the shares upon receiving the sum of US$350,000 and interest thereon. 
7.  I gave judgment to the petitioner upon the undertaking of the petitioner that upon the petitioner receiving the US$350,000 and interest
thereon as adjudged, the petitioner do take all necessary steps to revert the shares in Tabatha V Inc that are registered in the
petitioner’s name to the transferor. 
8.  I then adjudged that judgment be for the petitioner and his company, the 2nd defendant therein, on the claim and the counterclaim,
and that the debtor and his company (named as the 2nd plaintiff in that action) do pay the petitioner the sum of US$350,000 or its
Hong Kong dollar’s equivalent at the time of payment with interest, at 2.5 per cent above the best lending rate of the said bank
from 9 April 2009 until judgment, and at judgment rate thereafter until payment. 
The debtor’s grounds
9.  The debtor in his “[r]evised cause against bankruptcy petition” said that:

“the judgment essentially requires of the following steps:
1. Upon this “undertaking”, YIP Chi Him Roger (“YIP”) is to pay the money US$350,000 plus interest to Lee, and
2. Upon receiving this money, Lee is to return the shares of Tabatha V Inc to YIP.
This is an order for a two-way exchange of shares and money between the two parties, not a one-way payment of money from one party to the other. The money amount
mentioned in the petition is not a “debt” but a payment upon an undertaking to transfer shares back to the payor”.

10.  He further submitted that:

“The ultimate objective of this order is to achieve refund for property returned (i.e. the shares). There is no detail in the order
for the question of how long the time lag should be for the return of property after payment, but it cannot be forever, nor never.
It is not about the time and sequence, but the ultimate objective of the order that matters; and it is all about achieving refund
and returning property.
Any one-way enforcement of the order must be wrong.
1. The property can be sold for money. The price of this property has also appreciated in value - and the rate of appreciation is
huge due to excessive demand from Chinese companies wishing to go public in the US and the current economic boom (vs. the bust years
at the time of litigation, i.e. the sub-prime mortgage crisis during December 2007 - June 2009);
2. If payment without return of property was allowed, this would imply that the property could be kept and sold by the petitioner
for extra money. This would also imply that the property could even be sold later, or now, or before judgment issuance, or before
trial, by the petitioner, who then still ask for refund. All such scenarios result in double compensation to the petitioner.
Therefore, payment without return of property is unjust.
No matter what the status of registration of Tabatha’s shares at the US Securities Exchange Commission (“the SEC”) is, the property
(i.e. the shares) has to be in existence - this is the absolute minimum requirement. Hence, there has to be evidential proof for
ownership. In the present case, this would mean:
1. a brokerage company issuing the latest shareholders’ list that includes the name and number of shares owned;
2. indication by the official transfer agent (Madison Stock Transfer Inc.), that the shares can be transferred via a proper process
of share transfer.
However, the petitioner has never tried to mention about any proof of ownership and transferability. Recall that his representative
lawyer told the Master in court on 14 February 2018 that the petitioner could clear some procedures of paying back some due fees
and fines for getting the shares back, he should have shown proof for such procedures’ validity in a next meeting or by now; however,
he has not mentioned about such matters again since then.
…
In conclusion, the petitioner has not properly followed the judgment order; hence it should be rejected.”

11.  The effect of the petitioner’s undertaking and my judgment is that after the debtor has paid the judgment debt of US$350,000 plus
interest, the petitioner should perform his undertaking of reverting the shares to the transferor.  However, Mr Yip, in his grounds
that I have recited above, tried to turn my judgment and the plaintiff’s undertaking into simultaneous steps of exchange, to be
undertaken by the parties.  That is a wrong interpretation of my judgment and the plaintiff’s undertaking. 
12.  In fact, the debtor had made a similar submission to the Court of Appeal in CACV 174/2015, when he appealed against my judgment.
 The Court of Appeal said in paragraphs 54 and 56 of the judgment that:

“54. Also, the terms of the undertaking of the 1st Defendant only oblige him to take all steps necessary to revert the Tabatha shares registered in his name to the company of the 1st Plaintiff, BVI Capital upon receiving the US$350,000. Two points emerge from this. First, the Plaintiffs have not yet paid the US$350,000
and the 1st Plaintiff told us that he had no means to pay. Second, the fact that Tabatha was not registered at SEC does not mean that the shares
could not be reverted to BVI Capital if such payment is made.
…
56. Hence we do not accept the 1st Defendant could not perform his obligations under the undertaking.  We do not see any unfairness in the judgment in this respect.”

13.  In the premises, the debtor’s grounds of opposition have no merit.  I therefore make an order in terms of the amended petition,
with costs of the amended petition be paid by the debtor.

Ming Tak should pay to Water Motors the sum of $1,444,843.58. 335.  I also order Ming Tak to pay Water Motors interest on the said sum of $1,444,843.58 at the judgment rate from the date of filing
of the counterclaim to the date hereof. 336.  Since Water Motors has succeeded on the counterclaim which overtopped Ming Tak’s claim substantially, I make a costs order nisi that Ming Tak do pay Water Motors the costs of this action including the counterclaim with certificate for two counsel to be taxed.
 I also make a costs order nisi that Ming Tak do pay the costs of SW Chan up to the commencement of the trial with certificate for two counsel to be taxed.","Total:

CHINACULTURE.COM LTD v. LAM TING BALL AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 742; HCA 2902/2017 (11 April 2018),"9.  In my view, although this response to the complaint of an undervaluation is pleaded in general terms, it raises the matters which
the evidence I have referred to above addresses.  The amendments proposed to be made to [15] flesh out the averment in sub-para (3)
and describe the advice the Board received and, which it appears largely determined the offer price.  It is hardly a surprise that
the Board took advice from investment bankers on an appropriate offer price and that the Board was largely guided by what it was
told.  Excluding evidence about this would leave the court with an incomplete picture of what took place.  What seems to have happened
is that neither party has properly understood the other sides’s case and that the sooner it is clear from the pleadings what each
party contend and evidence is prepared to address the arguments and counter-arguments the better.  If, as may be the case, the real
issues are (a) whether the method of pricing the shares was wrong and resulted in an underpricing and (b) the Board was negligent
in not recognising this; the sooner this becomes clear and relevant evidence adduced the better. 10.  I will, therefore, allow the amendments and dismiss the summons to strike out the contentious evidence.  The costs of and occasioned
by the amendments be to the Plaintiff in any event.  So far as the costs of the two summonses are concerned I will make an order
nisi that the costs of both be in the cause with a certificate for two counsel.  I consider that this is an appropriate order given that
the applications have been contentious because in my view of a degree of confusion to which both parties have to some degree contributed. 11.  If further directions are required for the conduct of the Action or the current directions require amendment the parties should
approach my Clerk to fix an early case management conference.","CNT GROUP LIMITED

"LEUNG KIT HING, DORIS v. THE MAGISTRATE IN CHARGE OF ALL CASE MANAGEMENT MATTERS AT KOWLOON CITY MAGISTRATES’ COURTS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 719; HCAL 419/2018 (12 April 2018)","4.  On 22 March 2018, the Applicant filed a fresh application and an affidavit in purported compliance with the court’s directions
given on 15 March 2018.  Although the fresh application does not fully comply with the court’s said directions, in order not to
waste further time and costs, the court shall deal with the Applicant’s application as it currently stands. 5.  The question of what evidence is relevant and admissible in criminal proceedings is generally a matter to be determined by the trial
court and not a matter for judicial review, save in the most exceptional circumstances.  No such circumstances exist here.  If there
should be any error made by the trial Magistrate in his/her decision to admit or refuse to admit evidence, such errors can be corrected
in appeal proceedings from the Magistrate’s decision.  Further, it is generally a matter for the prosecution or the defence to
decide what evidence to deploy at the trial.  As earlier mentioned, Mr Peter Law previously directed the Applicant to provide to
the prosecution and defence counsel the evidence that she wished to produce for their consideration.  If the prosecution or defence
should consider the Applicant’s evidence to be relevant and helpful to their respective cases, the prosecution or defence could
apply to call the Applicant to give evidence at the trial.  Lastly, the Applicant’s current application is, in substance, an attempt
to re-litigate her previous application for leave to apply for judicial review in HCAL 1140/2017, which was rejected by Au J on 3
January 2018. 6.  In all the circumstances, I consider it to be clear that (i) the Applicant’s current application is not reasonably arguable, and
(ii) her repeated applications to litigate the same issue by way of judicial review amount to an abuse of the Court’s process.
 Accordingly, the present application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed.","CHEUNG TSZ-LUNG

Further, what follows in paragraph 33 states: “…But account should be taken of any account on the part of the legal representative and the applicant in the course of the wasted costs proceedings which may indicate a different Order should be made.” 25.  Thus, it is clear that “the party and party costs payable normally” only refers to the costs of the wasted costs proceedings,
not to the costs of the subject application of the wasted costs order where paragraph 62/8/9 still applies. 26.  I would therefore make the following order:","YAU LEE – HSIN CHONG JOINT VENTURE

been completed) which in part gave rise to the need to file a supplemental witness statement by them, the trial in this case is more
than 18 months away and the court was informed of the need to file a supplemental witness statement by the Defendants at the Case
Management Conference. 2.  I am unable to see what real prejudice there is to the Plaintiff if this application is allowed.  With respect, the Plaintiff’s
complaints are nothing more than suggestions that the trial preparation could have been better and various steps should have been
taken by the Defendants in a timely manner.  It is right that the court does not endorse inadequate trial preparation but the fact
is that the Defendants are trying to remedy the inadequacy well before the trial. 3.  There is no merit in the opposition and this application is allowed.",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/962.html,"

郭卓堅 v. 林鄭月娥 香港特別行政區首長 [2018] HKCFI 756; HCAL 531/2018 (13 April 2018),"5.  In my view, the present application is completely misconceived.  First, the words of the Chief Executive do not by themselves carry
any legal consequence and do not amount to any decision which can properly form the subject matter of an application for judicial
review. Second, as the Chief Executive of the HKSAR, she is plainly entitled to speak publicly on matters of public interest relating
to Hong Kong.  There can be no basis whatsoever to suggest that the Chief Executive, by commenting on or criticizing a remark made
by Mr Tai about the possibility of Hong Kong becoming an independent state in some hypothetical scenario, however far-fetched or
unrealistic such hypothetical scenario may be, has infringed the freedom of speech or the freedom of communication of Mr Tai or any
Hong Kong residents, or that the Chief Executive has acted contrary to the Basic Law or her Chief Executive Oath.  Third, the Applicant
has no standing to complain about the words of the Chief Executive.  The person who is most directly affected by those words would
be Mr Tai who, so far as is known to the court, has taken no legal action himself.  6.  It must be emphasized that the court only deals with proper, justiciable, legal issues.  The court’s jurisdiction in judicial
review should not be used by any person as a forum to air his/her political views. The present application is, in my view, plainly
an abuse of the court’s jurisdiction in judicial review and an abuse process of the court’s process.  7.  The application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed. ",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/756.html,"

SHIN KIN MAN v. CONVOY CHINA FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD [2018] HKCFI 860; HCMP 42/2018 (13 April 2018),"2.  The application, I must say, is a little bizarre.  The Company has already been convicted by the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts of
breaches of the Ordinance for the years 2014 and 2015.  The time for prosecution has already expired for the earlier years and therefore
an extension of time is not necessary for those years in order to avoid the risk of prosecution.  The remaining year is 2016. 3.  However, it is quite clear from the evidence that has been filed by Mr Shin, who is a director of the Company, that he knew of the
requirements of the Ordinance and must have understood them by 15 February 2017 at the very latest.  By that date not only had the
Company received letters from the Companies Registry asking questions about the apparent non-compliance, but on that date Mr Shin
attended a meeting with the Companies Registry to discuss the matter.  It will be appreciated that the Company had until 30 September
2017 in order to prepare its financial statement for the calendar year 2016 and lay the financial statement before the Company in
general meeting.  There is no explanation in the evidence of why despite being aware of the requirements of the Ordinance by the
15 February 2017 at latest, the Company failed in the following seven and a half months to prepare financial statements and lay them
before the Company at an AGM.  4.  It seems to me clear in those circumstances that there is no basis for the court to exercise its discretion to extend time in respect
of the 2016 accounts and I therefore dismiss the originating summons.  No order as to costs was sought in the originating summons
and none is necessary.","CONVOY CHINA FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. ANDREW LIU AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1105; HCMP 2653/2016 (13 April 2018),"5.  I do not accept that that is the correct approach.  An assessment of whether or not it was reasonable for the application to be
made would seem to me to necessitate of itself an independent assessment of the strength of an application or opposition to an application,
and would simply be an invitation for parties to embark on peripheral applications which would only add time and expense to legal
proceedings.  It seems to me that generally where an interlocutory application has been clearly determined in one party’s favour,
then almost invariably the successful party will be entitled to its costs, and that it will only be in unusual circumstances that
there will be reason for the court to order differently and for there to be any justification in a party inviting the court to undertake
a review of the application and the circumstances in which it came to be made.  Parties should be advised that this is the basis
on which costs will be ordered and assess whether or not to instruct an application to be made or opposed on this basis. 6.  I therefore will not vary my original costs order. 7.  Mr Ambrose Ho SC, who appeared with Mr Jeff Chan for the SFC, has asked for the costs of this application to be ordered on an indemnity
basis.  I will not make that order.  I will simply order that Mr Best pays the SFC’s costs with a certificate for one counsel forthwith.
 I would however note, that it does not seem to me that there is much, if any, substance in this application, and that if a further
application is to be made in these or other proceedings on the same, in my view, misconceived basis, I might be more inclined to
order indemnity costs.",Date of Decision: 13 April 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1105.html,"

court’s discretion to override the time limitation given the circumstances of the whole case: the delay was at most about 14 months.
 Even if Mr. Chan found it difficult to locate the 3 co‑workers, as his main defence must be that he and the plaintiff were some
sort of “business partners” (and not employer/employee), I would think that the co-workers would unlikely be witnesses to such
a business agreement. In any case, the prejudice against the plaintiff of not being able to claim against a potential employer far
outweighs any prejudice against Chan. 31.  Accordingly, I would grant order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 10 of the Summons. 32.  As for costs:",Date of Decision: 16 April 2018(Harold Leong),Master of the High Court,/2018/762.html,"

CHAN KON FUNG v. GALLOP PIONEER LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 766; HCA 1357/2011 (17 April 2018),"157.  Mr Li SC made a final complaint that the terms of the 19/12/17 Order looked quite different from the Proposed Directions. I note
PRC Yunnan Tin was the only party who proactively made proposals for disposal of the joinder applications, and it invited alternative
proposals by P and/or Ds (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). In my view, there was nothing in Mr Li SC’s contention. The 19/12/17
Order took into account the state of progress of and other outstanding matters in the present litigation, and weaved a case management
timetable to fit in those matters (including the Expert Summons). But this did not detract from the fact that PRC Yunnan Tin achieved
substantial success in respect of the PRCYT Summons. 158.  Having considered all the circumstances and for all the above reasons, I consider that costs should follow the event save that a
discount is made to reflect the matters in paragraphs 155-156 above. I therefore order that P shall pay PRC Yunnan Tin 80% of the
costs of and occasioned by the PRCYT Summons (including costs of the 3rd Hearing on 19 December 2017 and all costs reserved if any) to be taxed forthwith if not agreed with certificate for two counsel. 159.  Although Mr Li SC suggested it might not be appropriate to have certificate for two counsel, the complexity of the matter as explained
in this decision spoke to the propriety of having two counsel. I also note P also engaged two counsel to resist Ds’ and PRC Yunnan
Tin’s applications for costs.","(b)            
the PRCYT Summons overlapped with Ds’ Joinder and Amended Joinder Summonses which were disclosed to PRC Yunnan Tin on 7 March 2017
(see paragraph 13 above) well before PRC Yunnan Tin issued the PRCYT Summons on 10 April 2017, so PRC Yunnan Tin as “putative party”
could have simply filed evidence in support of Ds’ joinder application and asked to be heard at the 3rd Hearing without making any separate application.(Marlene Ng)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/766.html,"

Lastly, I note that there is a suggestion that the Plaintiffs’ claims are or may be barred by acquiescence or unconscionable conduct
(see paragraph 82 of Mr Wong’s skeleton skeletons).  The factual matters relied upon in support of this defence, namely, those
set out in paragraphs 74 to 78 of Mr Sze’s Affirmation, are not referred to in the Defence filed on 20 February 2016.  I do not
consider that the Defendants should be permitted to rely on such defence which has not been pleaded or adequately pleaded.  In any
event, the matters relied upon by Mr Sze have been adequately explained by Ms Kang Lili in paragraphs 15 to 19 of her Second Affirmation,

wrong advice, including agreeing to the offset of a total of $5 million provided by her husband by way of litigation funding. The
plaintiff strongly denied any of them. As I discussed these matters with both counsel at the hearing, all these disputes could not
be decided at the hearing before me and by way of affidavit evidence. They were not to be determined at the taxation herein, even
if taxation would be ordered by the court. Parties would have to resolve them by other appropriate procedures elsewhere. 32.  I have not had the benefit of arguments from parties as to the question of costs. It of course follows event unless there are circumstances
to the contrary. In our present case, the plaintiff wins in the argument on common law jurisdiction of the court and successfully
defends for taxation of 4 bills. On the other hand, the defendant has persuaded me to refer 6 bills for taxation. She only dropped
her argument that all bills were interim at the hearings before me. The time and costs spent by both parties are more or less the

magistrate’s finding that the appellant was acquitted as she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s
judgment was not affected by her eye-diseases as exactly disclosed and supported by those three medical reports which were already
within the knowledge of the prosecution even before the trial.  During the trial, neither was the medical evidence of DW2 challenged
by the prosecution nor did the prosecution call upon their own expert to testify in reply.  Based on the reason of the acquittal,
despite the adverse findings against the appellant by the magistrate, the prosecution case was inherently weak and the prosecution
has not discharged the burden and failed to prove whether the appellant knew or believed she was making a false claim and thereby
misleading the police. Based on the reasons of the acquittal, it would also seem that the whole trial was unnecessary and the costs
occasioned by the defence could have be avoided if the prosecution took the same view of the magistrate on the medical reports submitted
and accepted the offer by the defence to dispose the matter without a trial. 24.  For the above reasons, I disagree with the respondent who submitted that there was clear evidence before the magistrate for her
to conclude that the appellant had in fact brought suspicion upon herself.   25.  Accordingly, I will allow this appeal to award costs of the trial to the appellant to be taxed, and I also award the appellant her
costs of this appeal to be taxed, if not agreed.",Date of Judgment: 18 April 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/786.html,"

CHEN CHUANG XIN v. ZHAO BIN [2018] HKCFI 961; HCCT 59/2017 (18 April 2018),"5.  Section 93 of the Ordinance provides that if an application is made for enforcement on the Mainland, and the award has not been
fully satisfied, the award is still enforceable to the extent that it has not been satisfied - subject, of course, to section 93.
 6.  The application made for enforcement on the Mainland has been withdrawn in this case, with leave of the Mainland court.  Whether
or not any charge on the property is released, so long as the award has not been fully satisfied, the award can be enforced in Hong
Kong to the extent that it has not been satisfied.  7.  On these grounds, the application to set aside the order granting leave to enforce the award is dismissed, with costs on an indemnity
basis, in the usual way as ordered in the arbitration court. ",Date of Decision: 18 April 2018(Mimmie Chan),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/961.html,"

the owners of the Unclaimed Funds, but has not been able to contact any of them.  The applicant therefore is unable to obtain a discharge
from any of the beneficiaries of the Unclaimed Funds. 10.  Accordingly, I agree with the applicant that this is an appropriate case where the court should invoke its jurisdiction under section 62 of the Trustee Ordinance, and make the following orders sought in the originating summons:- 11.  As far as costs is concerned, I have considered the skeleton bill lodged with the applicant’s Skeleton Submissions.  Taking a
broad-brush approach, I would summarily assess the costs of and occasioned by this application at HK$590,000.","GLENLYON LIMITED

SZETO KWOK HUNG ROQUE v. SZETO KWOK KWONG BERNARD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1069; HCMP 2596/2017 (18 April 2018),"11.  I have considered the various affidavits filed by and on behalf of the parties.  I have also considered the submissions of Mr Remedios
and the plaintiff.  There are indeed factual matters which are in dispute, and potentially hotly.  They include whether the defendants
had caused Madam Tang to have been discharged from hospital prematurely, whether the plaintiff had made threats to Madam Tang and
the 1st defendant, whether the plaintiff had been denied access to Madam Tang whilst she was at her residence, whether the plaintiff had
been refused access to Madam Tang’s medical records, and whether the defendants had otherwise provided adequate care to Madam Tang.
 These are all issues which cannot be appropriately adjudicated upon summarily on affidavit evidence only.  I further note that in
his written submissions, the plaintiff was still trying to offer evidence which has not been covered by his previous affidavits.
 All these will have to be tidied up so as to make the action trial ready. 12.  I have considered the appropriate procedural options ahead.  One alternative to ordering that the action be proceeded with as if
commenced by writ is to order the attendance of witnesses for cross-examination.  The action will become ready for trial earlier.
 Time is important, given the age of Madam Tang.  On the other hand, given the imposition and continuation of the inter partes Injunction Order, and that the status quo appears to have been satisfactorily maintained, time pressure is slightly off.  Given the extent of the dispute on facts, and the
fact that the action was only commenced in late November last year, I am of the view on balance that I should accede to the defendants’
application and order that the action should be continued as if commenced by writ.  I also made the directions sought in the Directions
Summons. 13.  I will hear the parties on costs.",Date of Decision: 18 April 2018(Keith Yeung SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1069.html,"

proposed a period of 2 months if all 3 grounds would be established. He succeeded in 2 grounds. Within them, I do not entirely agree
on all the allegations of the judgment creditors. With the benefit of the above authorities and bearing in mind the particular facts
of the present case, including those in paragraph 32 above, I take the view that a total period of imprisonment for 1 month appropriately
reflects the conduct of Mr. Chan having found by this court.  I so order accordingly. I also fix the support and maintenance allowance
at the rate of $725 a day pursuant to O.49B r.2 RHC. 38.  I see no reason why Mr. Chan should not pay costs of the examination.  There will be an order nisi that Mr. Chan do pay costs of

which the Commissioner can, on the facts, properly come to.  That being the position, the Commissioner’s decision not to provide

even if the Board has disciplinary jurisdiction over the 1st Interested Party, it does not have any power to make disciplinary order against her. 51.  Finally, as the complaints are trivial in nature, there is minimal public interest in re-investigating the complaints or imposing
any disciplinary orders on the 1st Interested Party.  Hence, even if there is any merit in the grounds of challenge, which I do not accept it to be the case, the court
should not grant the relief as sought by the Applicants. 52.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the Applicant’s application for judicial review.

As I have said in The Real Estate Developers Association, supra, at paragraphs 8 - 10, the court in exercising its discretion to make an appropriate costs order must take into account and reflect
the applicant’s ultimate success in the judicial review and the position that the unsuccessful grounds cannot be said to be raised
unreasonably.  However, it does not mean that the court in the right case should and could not reduce part of the applicant’s costs to achieve a just and fair result by applying the above principles. 13.  Applying the above principles to the present circumstances as mentioned above,[1] I think it is unfair to require the TPB to bear all the costs of the applicant.  Looking at the matters in the round, I agree that
it is just and proportionate to deduct 30% of the applicant’s cost to reflect the position. 14.  In the premises, I would vary the costs order nisi to the extent that 70% of the applicant’s costs be borne by the TPB, with certificate for two counsel.  The costs of this application

 More particularly, she seems to think that the Presiding Officer has decided against her on the Settlement Agreement or that she
could obtain a determination avoiding the Settlement Agreement by appealing against the Order.  I say so because: 12.  The Presiding Officer has not made any determination regarding the validity of the Settlement Agreement either way.  She has simply
decided, correctly, that the claimant has to go to another court for adjudication on the Settlement Agreement.  That other court
is not the CFI hearing an application for leave to appeal against the Order.  On an application for leave to appeal under s 32 of
the LTO, the CFI is confined to investigating if the award, order or determination under challenge is erroneous in point of law or
outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  It cannot do anything about the Settlement Agreement.  If the claimant wishes to pursue
the matter, she has to commence fresh proceedings. 13.  For these reasons, I dismiss the claimant’s application for leave to appeal against the Order.  I make no order as to costs.",Date of Decision: 20 April 2018(Lisa Wong),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/852.html,"

YU SHEUNG CHI JANET v. HUI TSANG YIK PHILIP AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 806; HCA 332/2015 (24 April 2018),"150.  It follows that the plaintiff’s case both in resulting and in constructive trust fails, and that the claim fails.  I find that
Mr Hui is holding the share in PUD as both the legal owner and beneficial owner, and that PUD is holding the Property as both the
legal and beneficial owner. 151.  Vacant possession of the Property must now be given.  As to the claim for mesne profits, in light of the parties’ agreement on
the expert evidence, I need only make a finding as to the period from which liability accrues.  In this respect, I hold that liability
accrues from 5 March 2015, the date on which Mr Cheng and the occupiers of the Property were given notice by solicitors’ letter
of 6 February 2015 that they had to leave the Property.  It continues up to the date of delivery of vacant possession.  The parties
should agree the figures. 152.  On the basis that costs follow the event, I will make an order nisi that the plaintiff is to be liable for the defendants’ costs to be taxed if not agreed.","PACIFIC UNITED DEVELOPMENT LIMITED

so that she would not be in breach of her condition of stay.  She also had a very strong emotional tie with the son of Leung who
was a mentally disabled and whom she was entrusted to take care for more than 12 years, a factor which seems has not been given sufficient
weight when the magistrate dismissed the appellant’s decision to put up with her situation as unreasonable. 60.  If what the appellant said was to be believed, the appellant’s evidence would give rise to the defence that at all material times
she had an honest and reasonable belief that either she had a valid employment visa, or that the Director of Immigration was processing
her papers and would ultimately give her a visa.  In this case, the defence was rejected because the magistrate did not regard her
as honest and credible, when unfairly, her credibility was never challenged in the witness box. 61.  The failure on the part of the prosecution to cross-examine the appellant in the witness-box and the magistrate’s approach to
assess the appellant’s credibility in vacuum without ever considering the need for her explanation is in my judgment, a major deficiency
in her assessment of the credibility of the appellant and her conclusion as to whether the appellant has made out her defence of
“honest and reasonable belief”.  Accordingly, for this reason, the conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory and I shall allow
this appeal and quash the conviction. ","DUMAYAG, ANALYN PEDRO

 The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant has committed acts of passing-off in that the Defendant’s use of the marks as specified
above, which are either identical or confusingly similar to the Plaintiff’s trade names and trade marks on goods which are identical
or similar to the Plaintiff’s products, willlikely mislead the public into believing that the goods sold by the Defendantwere goods
of the Plaintiff, see Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc[1990] UKHL 12;  [1990] 1 WLR 491, at 499E–H.  11.  It is also the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant has, by reason of the above acts, infringed the Plaintiff’s registered trade
marks by virtue of section 18(1) and (2) of the Trade Marks Ordinance.  12.  Upon considering the contents of the Statement of Claim and also the Plaintiff’s Skeleton Submissions, I am satisfied that the
Plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought in the Statement of Claim.  I therefore order that judgment be entered against the Defendant
in terms of paragraphs 1 to 6 of the summons.  I also make an order that costs of this action, including costs of and occasioned
by this application, summarily assessed at HK$30,000, be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff forthwith. ",Date of Judgment: 24 April 2018(Richard Khaw SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1031.html,"

MA WAI WAH v. NEWAY KARAOKE BOX LTD [2018] HKCFI 842; HCA 669/2013 (25 April 2018),"125.  I have found that $50 million of the loan advanced to Ma were dividends declared and paid by the Company in August 2007, out of
which $4 million representing Ma’s share were handed over to Ma.  Suek might have dishonestly represented or treated the dividend
as his.  That does not change the nature of the payment.  The dividend had been duly paid to Ma.  I have accordingly reduced the
actual amount of loan.  The claim for dividend against the Company therefore fails. The overall result would not have been any different
had I ruled otherwise. The Company would be liable in paying the wrong person and had to pay the dividend to Ma again, but Ma’s
liability under Suek’s counterclaim would be increased by the same amount.  The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is dismissed. 126.  In view of the above conclusion, there is no need to consider the counterclaim by the defendant, which, as Mr Mak submits, would
only arise if I were to find in favour of the plaintiff in the claim. 127.  In conclusion, I make the following orders:",Date of Judgment: 25 April 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/842.html,"

parties, I therefore conclude that in the exercise of my discretion, I should grant the amendment as sought by the defendants. 26.  It follows that I would also grant leave for the 2nd defendant to file the supplemental witness statement as sought. So with that decision, I hear parties on costs and consequential
directions. 27.  I rule, in this regard, I am in favour of Mr D’Souza[‘s submission on costs].  Albeit [I was] persuaded that this amendment
should be allowed to enable just resolution of the dispute in the parties, it is clear in the case laws that an explanation by the
amending party is called for.  And in this present application, that was clearly lacking.  And it was really in a delicate balancing
exercise that I ultimately concluded leave should be given. I agree with Mr D’Souza that this is a case that the court would not
fault a litigant in the position of the plaintiff to say that they should have consented [to the application]. The plaintiff’s
contest against it, in my view, therefore, is reasonable.  So I would make the costs of and occasioned by both defendants’ summonses
dated October 2017, with certificate for counsel, be to the plaintiff, save that the costs of today’s hearing be costs in the cause,

RE RBC INVESTOR SERVICES TRUST HONG KONG LTD [2018] HKCFI 890; [2018] 5 HKC 80; HCMP 2740/2017 (27 April 2018),"36.  One of the reasons the applicant advanced for the application is that the existence of unclaimed assets in the applicant’s system
“represents an unnecessary expenditure of time and resources to continue to maintain records and to ring-fence the unclaimed assets”.
 Given the nature of the applicant’s business and the services it provides outlined, continuing costs to ring-fence such assets
would be part of its ordinary business costs and nothing out of the ordinary.  But funds and securities lodged in the High Court
are held subject to the Suitors’ Funds Rules (“the Suitors’ Funds Rules”) with the consequence that the cost of administering
such assets would be defrayed out of the general revenue of Hong Kong.  The order would effectively transfer the costs burden from
the applicant to the taxpayer and needs justification. 37.  In the present case, the fact that the bulk of unclaimed assets were in a sense ‘inherited’ by RBC in that those assets were
already unclaimed by the time RBC acquired a majority interest in the applicant in 2012 and, as such, was not of the applicant’s
own making.  While adequate due diligence in 2012 might have brought the current problems to light earlier, it is highly unlikely
that it would have made any difference to the state of affairs.  38.  Rule 23(1) of the Suitors’ Funds Rules provides that where a sum of money remains unclaimed in the court for a period of 5 years,
the Chief Justice may, on application by the Registrar, order such sum to be transferred to the general revenue of Hong Kong.  Were

HKSAR v. WALSH KENT ANDREW [2018] HKCFI 921; HCCC 368/2015 (27 April 2018),"6.  A similar decision was given in Secretary for Security v Sakthevel Prabakar [2003] HKCFA 37;  (2003) 6 HKCFAR 397.  The Appeal Committee of the Court of Final Appeal held that even in the field of public law, the fact that an appeal would be academic
as between the parties was a strong factor against granting leave to appeal, but it was not an absolute bar.  The Committee stated
that granting of appeal could be appropriate if there was a sufficiently great public interest to be served by having a question
of public law decided by the Court of Final Appeal.[3] 7.  The final case on which Mr McCoy relies is a decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in R v Gordon – Smith [2008] NZSC 56;  [2009] 1 NZLR 721, where it was held that mootness was not a matter that deprived accorded jurisdiction to hear an appeal, but like the other cases
to which I have referred, emphasising that there were important reasons for caution in exercising discretion to hear an appeal when
there were no live issues between the parties.  These included the importance of the adversary system, the need for economy and the
use of court resources and the proper role of the courts.[4]  The Court analysed these reasons, emphasising that a cautious approach should be taken to leave applications where there are no
live issues between the parties.[5]  It would seem to me that given the nature of the application and the issues that have to be considered, that this is an exercise
of discretion by the relevant appellate court.  8.  I therefore refused the application, although I note in passing that the applicant may proceed to apply for a certificate and leave
to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal pursuant to section 32(3) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance.",Date of Ruling: 27 April 2018(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/921.html,"

In the circumstances, I am prepared to grant retrospective leave for the Doctor to file/serve the OT 2nd Aff to regularise the matter since I have dealt with the affirmation de bene esse. However, since the Doctor failed to vary the Parents Costs Order Nisi and the costs order nisi in paragraph 18 of the Reasons (see paragraph below), such time indulgence was in principle futile, and the Doctor should therefore
pay the Parents’ costs of and occasioned by the Time Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed on
High Court scale and party-and-party basis, and the Parents’ own costs be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations. 125.  The Parents Costs Order Nisi and the costs order nisi in paragraph 18 of the Reasons are made absolute. I grant a costs order nisi that the Doctor shall pay the Parents costs of and occasioned by (a) the Summons (including costs of the Doctor Strike Out Costs

the Petitioner and Yuen, who were equal partners, seem to me to suggest that a winding-up petition in respect of Grandview was not
surprising and was perhaps foreseeable if not even inevitable.  Nor can I conclude that the change in circumstances was brought about
by some unreasonable conduct on the part of the Petitioner: see Brookes, supra, at §6(6).  In any event, Yuen did not insist that Grandview be wound up as a condition for withdrawing his strike-out summons against
the petition for winding up the Company. 13.  Furthermore, although the petition to wind up Grandview was issued on 27 January 2017, the summons to withdraw the strike-out summons
was not issued until 15 March 2017, a mere 6 days before the hearing. In fact, the Petitioner’s affirmation of 1 August 2016 already
stated that because of the deadlock, Grandview might go into default and he anticipated that an application to wind it up was imminent. 14.  In these circumstances I do not think the strike‑out summons was rendered academic by subsequent developments.  I was not impressed
by its merits to start with, and it seems to me it was simply withdrawn by Yuen for his own strategic or other reasons.  For these
reasons the costs must be paid by Yuen to the Petitioner, including the costs of the argument on costs.",IN THE MATTER of SMART LAND INVESTMENT LIMITED (Company No. 1003073)(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First Instance High Court,/2018/901.html,"

incurred before there can be a hearing for assessment, which is most unlikely to be heard within the next 10 or 12 months, and taking
into account the underlying objectives of increasing cost effectiveness of proceedings, promoting procedural economy and ensuring
that the resources of the court are fairly distributed, the stay of proceedings sought by the Defendants is in my view sensible and

application for leave to appeal to the CFA.  Thereafter, the parties can either agree to a further period of stay (subject to the

I will make an order nisi that costs of this application be to the Commissioner, to be taxed if not agreed.  However, such costs should not include the costs
of the leave application hearing on 20 April 2015.  The Commissioner by that time had not filed any evidence to show (as the court
has now accepted in this judgment) that the relevant impact assessments had indeed been carried out.  It was therefore not unreasonable
for the applicant to pursue the leave application based on the available evidence at that time.  Insofar as the leave application
is concerned (including the hearing on 20 April 2015), I think it is only just and fair to make no order as to costs. 89.  I thank counsel for their assistance in this matter.","F

I should mention there was a question, which I confess was first raised by me, as to whether s 42 of the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4), which empowers the court to make orders for discovery by third parties, applies in relation to the removal application at
all because under the section the power is conferred on the court “[o]n the application … of a party to any proceedings in which
a claim is made”.  It was not clear to me what kind of “claim” was envisaged and whether the removal application qualifies
as proceedings “in which a claim is made”. 27.  Prior to the Civil Justice Reform in 2009, s 42 was confined to “proceedings in which a claim in respect of personal injuries to a person or in respect of a person’s death is made” (italics added).  As a result of the recommendation in the reform to make non‑party discovery applicable to “all types
of cases (and not merely to personal injury and death claims)”[7], the words italicised in the quotation above were removed.  The section was therefore not enacted with a view to distinguishing between
proceedings in which a claim is made and proceedings in which no claim is made.  Rather, it was amended with the object of extending
its scope from proceedings in which claims for damages for personal injury and death are made to all types of proceedings.  With
this object in mind I think there is no reason not to attach a wide meaning to the word “claim” which ought to encompass any
case in which relief is sought from the court. 28.  For these reasons both summonses for discovery are dismissed, with costs on a nisi basis.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/939.html,"

WRIGHT SALLY JANE v. SUSAN COOK [2018] HKCFI 953; HCAP 26/2012 (30 April 2018),"19.  Where the proceedings in question should never have been brought or defended but the party nevertheless unreasonably and unjustifiably
persisted, he may well be visited with indemnity costs.  See Huge Dragon Corp Ltd v Lung Mun Oasis (IO) [2014] HKCA 216; [2014] 3 HKLRD 286, per Jeremy Poon J (as he then was) at [13] and the cases cited therein.  This is such a case.  It would be apparent from the Judgment
that I consider Sally’s denial of Susan’s claim to the Estate (which should be understood to be a claim to share in the administration
and distribution of the Estate after Susan’s indication of acceptance of Sally’s joint claim in the Offer) to be utterly devoid
of merits and should not have been persisted in. 20.  For the sake of completeness, my attention has also been drawn to Sally’s repeated refusals to attempt mediation in 2013 and 2016
on the apparent ground that the parties resided in different jurisdictions (Sally in United Kingdom and Susan in Australia).  Given
the steadfastly hostile attitude displayed by Sally towards Susan and her counterclaim, I seriously doubt whether mediation, even
if attempted, would have been fruitful.  More importantly, I do not see this as a point separate from Sally’s denial of Susan’s
counterclaim on unmeritorious grounds. 21.  For these reasons, I hereby vary the costs order nisi made in paragraph 53 of the Judgment as follows:",(Lisa Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/953.html,"

GENG HUA ZHONG AND ANOTHER v. LI SHU HON AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1041; HCCW 403/2017 (30 April 2018),"5.  Ms Law’s basis for suggesting that further financial information should be required demonstrating the current financial state
of the Company was that the onus was upon it to demonstrate its solvency and justify the application.  I accept that as a very general
statement, that would appear to be correct.  However, as I have sought to emphasise in Emagist [6]and on other occasions, applications for validation of expenses incurred in the normal course of business by a company, which the
petitioner itself says is solvent and acknowledges has an ongoing business, need to be considered in a practical manner.  If the
petitioner itself has in its petition acknowledged that a company is solvent and carrying on a business, one would not expect the
evidence that the company files to support a validation order to be particularly extensive as its financial state, or its general
financial state, should not be contentious.  It is only if the petitioner has particular concerns that it can substantiate about
the possible adverse impact on its economic interest in the company that the court should, in practice, be concerned to look in any
detail at its financial position.  The application is not an opportunity for the petitioner to obtain financial information not otherwise
available to it, or an opportunity to criticise or query the current management’s business decisions.  I would expect it only to
be in unusual cases for validation order applications arising from just and equitable winding‑up petitions issued by shareholders
to be contentious.  If both parties are being sensible, it should be possible for them to agree the terms of the validation order
which, it is now common practice, will contain a term requiring a schedule of payments to be provided on a monthly basis to the petitioner. 6.  I will make a validation order in the terms discussed with counsel which I will append to these reasons.  7.  I will make an order that the 1st respondent’s costs of the application are paid out of the assets of the Company.  Mr Maurellet SC sought no other costs order.
 Ms Law sought an order that the petitioners’ costs of the application be paid by the 1st respondent.  Although the application came on at short notice, it still seems to me that the petitioners should have been able to
have agreed an order with the 1st respondent as it is the petitioners’ principal position that no order should be made today.  I will, therefore, deal with costs

CHUNG WAI CHUN SUSANNA v. CHUNG PAN YUK [2018] HKCFI 959; HCAP 22/2015 (3 May 2018),"9.  On 26 April 2018, the Plaintiff filed (i) an affirmation of Tsung Pui Keung, a solicitors’ clerk in the employ of S H Chan &
Co and one of the attesting witnesses to the execution of the Will by the Deceased, to prove that it was duly executed by the Deceased,
and (ii) the 2nd affirmation of Ho Wing Kwong Sam, the Plaintiff’s current solicitor, to explain that the other attesting witness (namely, Chan
Suk Hung, formerly of S H Chan & Co) could not be located despite the exercise of reasonable diligence. 10.  On the basis of the existing materials, I am satisfied that the Will was the last will and testament of the Deceased duly executed
by him, and that the Grant should not have been issued to the Defendant.  I am also satisfied that all potential beneficiaries of
the Estate, including the 7 children of Chung Bun Tuen, have received notice of this action (some of them have consented to the revocation
of the Grant while some have taken no action despite steps having been taken by the Plaintiff’s solicitors to give them notice
of these proceedings).  Accordingly, I revoke the Grant, and pronounce in solemn form for the force and validity of the Will. 11.  As for costs, I order the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff’s costs of this action up to the hearing on 11 April 2018, to be taxed

having knowledge of the existence of the Will.  I do not consider that the Plaintiff should be entitled to further costs incurred

is nothing in the papers before me that suggests that the underlying dispute giving rise to this action has to be resolved urgently. 20.  Balancing the parties’ competing interests, I adjourn the trial and vacate the May 2018 trial dates.  The dates for the adjourned
trial should be fixed in consultation with the plaintiff’s counsel’s diary, which should in any event be not before October 2018. 21.  I reserve the question of costs of the further adjournment.  Although the 1st defendant cannot be blamed for getting sick, the abovementioned chronology suggests that she has failed to alert the court and the

RE THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF CHINA POINT STOCK BROKERS LTD [2018] HKCFI 1106; HCMP 297/2018 (3 May 2018),"3.  In these circumstances, it is necessary for the liquidators to be empowered to deal with the assets in such a way as to allow them
to bring the liquidation to an end.  That requires them to have the ability where possible to sell the securities and then to pay
the proceeds of the sale along with the cash that they also hold into court.  In the event that the liquidators are unable to sell
the securities, they will lodge the relevant share certificates with the Registrar of the High Court.  The mechanisms for achieving
these results are contained in sections 56 and 62 of the Trustee Ordinance, Cap 29.  4.  The approach of the court in these circumstances is broadly as I have just described and the principles are explained a little more
fully in [11]–[16] of the decision of Deputy High Court Judge Au (as he then was) in Re Drake & Morgan Ltd (unrep., HCMP 1490/2009, 27 August 2009): 5.  I will therefore make an order in the terms of the appendix to this decision.","Total value of SCC Securities (Post-Liquidation Abandoned Stocks)

whether these proceedings are pursued with that same ulterior motive.  Again, I cannot draw as the only irresistible inference that
they are.  The defendants have failed to show that the action is an abuse of the legal process. 63.  No allegation has been made that the plaintiff’s allegations are scandalous.  The plaintiff has presented a good prima facie case for declaratory relief, which is not bound to fail.  His action cannot be described as frivolous and vexatious. 64.  For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff has made out a good prima facie case against the 1st, 3rd and 4th defendants and that he is entitled to declaratory relief, but not as against the 2nd defendant.  Accordingly, I allow the appeal to the extent that the Re-Amended Statement of Claim be struck out and the action dismissed
as against the 2nd defendant with costs including the costs before the master.  All the other orders of the master are upheld.  I also make an order
that the plaintiff shall have costs of the appeal against the 1st defendant with certificate for two counsel; and the 2nddefendant shall have costs of the appeal against the plaintiff. ",Date of Decision: 4 May 2018( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/967.html,"

HKSAR v. CHOY WING LUNG GEOFFIEY DONAHUE [2018] HKCFI 972; HCMA 111/2018 (8 May 2018),"17.  The magistrate set out his sentencing considerations[13] in detail: 18.  Drivers of motor vehicles have a great responsibility to other road users. The purpose of a licensing system for driving is to ensure
that all drivers possess a minimum of driving skills, knowledge of road regulations and safety awareness. Whilst this system cannot
guarantee road safety, it at least stipulates that unqualified persons are not allowed to drive. If persons with no driving licences
are allowed to drive, and no serious regard is given to those in breach of the regulations in sentencing, it would not meet the public’s
expectations and send the wrong message. In sentencing, the magistrate has taken account of the factors to which he should have regard. 19.  At the appeal hearing, no one representing the appellant stated that the appellant’s appeal would be continued. The appellant
of the present case did not dispute his criminal liability. The material question is whether the sentences are contrary to legal
principles or manifestly excessive. Terminating this appeal would not have affected the appellant. Nor would it affect the interests
of justice or other public interest or other people. Accordingly, I agreed with the submission of the respondent and ordered that
the appellant’s appeal and the relevant legal proceedings had terminated and abated by reason of his death.",(A Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/972.html,"

the prejudicial effect of admitting the evidence.  Even if I were wrong to say that there are striking similarities between what
happened to “X” and “Y”, what I have described as to time, place and the modus operandi of the defendant regarding “X” and “Y” are features which amount to a significant connection going beyond mere coincidence
so that the evidence of one complainant may be regarded as supporting the truth of the other. 14.  For these reasons, I refused the application by the defendant for severance of counts 1 & 2 from counts 3 to 8. 15.

HEITKAMP &AMP; THUMANN KG v. LIVING PROFIT TRADING DEVELOP LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1006; HCA 151/2017 (8 May 2018),"104.  In the circumstances, D2’s 1st and 3rd Summonses are dismissed. I grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P costs of and occasioned by such summonses, including all costs reserved if any, to be taxed forthwith if not
agreed. 105.  As regards the D2 2nd Summons, once HSBC disclosed the bank statements of the D2 Account pursuant to the HSBC Disclosure Order in February 2017, P should
have realised the available balance in D2 Account exceeded US$500,000 (or even US$520,000), so there was no point in pursuing the
Disclosure Order in aid of the Injunction Order. Steps could have been taken then (or at least when D2 served the D2 1st Summons) to abandon or withdraw the Disclosure Order. The fact P did not do so until just before or at the Hearing meant P should
pay D2’s costs of the D2 2nd Summons. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that P shall pay D2’s costs of and occasioned by such summons, including all costs reserved if any, to be taxed forthwith if not
agreed. 106.  As for the P Summons, the relief sought in paragraph 28(a) above asked for continuation of Injunction Order, which was unnecessary
given the Inter Partes Order. The relief sought in paragraph 28(d) above asking for dismissal of the D 1st and 2nd Summonses was unnecessary since the determination of such summonses would have resolved the matter. As for the abandoned reliefs
in paragraph 28(b)-(c) above and the consequential relief in paragraph 28(e) above, on 28 July 2017 D2’s solicitors proposed payment
of US$520,000 into court.[79] When P’s solicitors wrote to D2’s solicitors on 7 November 2017 to confirm P’s agreement to such proposal with slight variation
that HSBC shall be directed to pay US$500,000 (or HK$ equivalent) (instead of US$520,000) out of the D2 Account into court as security
for P’s claim with costs reserved to enable the Injunction Order to be discontinued and the Hearing to be vacated, D2’s solicitors
replied on 13 November 2017 to say such belated response did not reflect any sincerity on P’s part, and in any event the offer
was “water under the bridge”. By then D2 was not willing to make payment into court as she believed the Injunction Order would
not have survived the Hearing, and she asked P to consent to immediate discharge of the Injunction Order with costs to her. As the
outcome of the D 1st and 3rd Summonses demonstrated, D2’s stance was inappropriate. But then the P Summons was also unnecessary. Since payment into court was
no better or different for P than the Injunction Order (with the amount to be frozen reduced to US$500,000), and as D2 unwilling
to make payment into court, there was no sensible reason for P to complicate matters by the proposal in the P Summons, especially
when instead of asking HSBC to pay US$500,000 out of the D2 Account into court P proposed an even more convoluted route by having
D2 utilise the funds in the D2 Account to buy a cashier order to give to P’s solicitors for payment into court. In my view, the
proper order (which I now make) is no order on the P Summons with costs order nisi that there be no order as to costs of such summons.","(b)            
The focus for P’s claim in knowing receipt and money had and received was on D2’s enrichment (US$500,000). Since D2’s liability
is restitutionary, it is fixed at the value of the property when she first received it.[77] 

     As for P’s proprietary claim, it was not necessarily inconsistent with the personal claim and recoveries from Haiyun and Welly
Smart. P had cumulative remedies and could go after the trustee or recipient, so the default judgment and recoveries against Haiyun
and Welly Smart would not necessarily debar P from suing D2. As explained in Serious Fraud Office v Lexi Holdings Plc,[78]
 “39. As made clear by Lord Millett in Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29;  [2001] 1 AC 102, an in personam claim against a defaulting trustee may be supplemented in addition by a claim to enforce an equitable charge or lien over the proceeds
in which the misappropriated assets have been mixed. That is an available remedy to secure compliance by the trustee with his personal
obligation to account. In this context Mr Marshall appositely cited the decision of the Privy Council in Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd [1996] 1 AC 514, 521 where Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said:


‘Faced with alternative and inconsistent remedies a plaintiff must choose between them. Faced with cumulative remedies a plaintiff
is not required to choose. He may have both remedies. He may pursue one remedy or the other remedy or both remedies, just as he wishes.
It is a matter for him. He may obtain judgment for both remedies and enforce both judgments. When the remedies are against two different
people, he may sue both persons. He may do so concurrently, and obtain judgment against both. Damages to the full value of goods
which have been converted may be awarded against two persons for successive conversions of the same goods. Or the plaintiff may sue
the two persons successively. He may obtain judgment against one, and take steps to enforce the judgment. This does not preclude
him from then suing the other.’            

      40. In the present case, Lexi by the form of the judgment it obtained on 19 March 2007 had elected to pursue its equitable
claim against M in personam. But that is not of itself inconsistent with a claim to an equitable charge, as Foskett v McKeown makes clear: it is a cumulative remedy in aid of an equitable in personam claim, not an alternative remedy. On the whole we do not think that, by electing to enter judgment in the form that it did, Lexi
is to be taken as having conclusively and for all purposes abandoned any further claim it might have for an equitable charge, sought
by way of further legal proceedings or steps. ……” 
But this is subject to prevention of double recovery, so it was necessary to turn to the amounts received by Haiyun and Welly Smart
from Pengshunyi.      

        Haiyun received US$790,000 from Pengshunyi, and P recovered HK$1,604,036.46 (ie about US$205,645.70 at the exchange rate
of HK$7.8 : US$1) from Haiyun. So P was entitled to sue D2 for the whole Haiyun Sum after giving credit.

Welly Smart received US$250,000 from Pengshunyi, and P recovered HK$1,455,887 (ie about US$186,652.18) from Welly Smart, so full
recovery of US$230,000 from D2 on its face may give rise to double recovery. Mr Ng suggested it was unclear whether the other sums
received by Welly Smart on 13-14 July 2016 were also traceable to P, but he conceded at the Hearing that at this stage there was
no evidence to support his contentions. But this was neither here nor there in light of (a) above.(Marlene Ng)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1006.html,"

been paid.  The circumstances warrant such a view of the facts.  At the hearing before me, the Appellant’s rerepresentative, Mr

Rather, the true difference is approximately HK$3750 in the defendants’ favour. 29.  If Mr Chung’s submissions are valid, any arithmetical error however insignificant would negate the effect of a conclusive evidence
clause.  What the Bank sought to do washave Mr Ma review the earlier calculations to verify their accuracy. Theamounts stated in
Mr Ma’s affirmation supersede those given by Brenda Chan earlier. It is not the case of the defendants being able to demonstrate
that there is something seriously wrong with Mr Ma’s calculations. The notion that any correction made by the Bank would have the

the suggestion that the court can grant a declaration belatedly suggested by Mr Miu under the prayer for “Further and other relief”,
Mr Man refers the court to the passage in Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018, para 18/15/4, where the editor stated that the court will not grant a declaration under a prayer for “further or other relief”
which is inconsistent with the specific relief that is expressly claimed.  I agree.  In any event, given that the plaintiff has never

RE ZHENG DUNQIAN [2018] HKCFI 955; HCB 3929/2017 (14 May 2018),"21.  The short answer to this ground is that, by letter dated 15 April 2016, solicitors for Full Baba, the plaintiff in HCA 956 of 2016,
viz Messrs Simon CW Yung & Co had served a copy of the Injunction on the Petitioner.  After some exchange of correspondence between
Simon CW Yung & Co and the Petitioner’s then solicitors viz Mayer Brown JSM (“JSM”), Simon CW Yung & Co expressly indicated to JSM by letter dated 29 July 2016 that Full Baba did not object to the Petitioner’s
intended disposal of the Shares in the margin securities account of Pure Sheen. There is thus no breach of the Injunction by the
Petitioner by transferring the Shares from Pure Sheen’s account to the Account.  In any event, it is difficult to see how this
transfer would render the Personal Guarantee or the Facility Agreement “illegal” and Mr Wong’s submissions in this regad are
wholly unconvincing. 22.  To conclude, none of the grounds put forward by the Debtor in opposing the Petition have any merits.  23.

has proved their case beyond all reasonable doubts and the defendant is convicted.”  Why the Magistrate so found appears in the
last two sentences of the penultimate paragraph of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings.  Those two sentences read: “Although
I have doubt regarding the missing tools and have excluded the verbal admission, I accept [PC 5018’s] evidence that he actually
found P1 in a wallet (P4) defendant was carrying.  I find the defendant has no lawful authority or reasonable excuse to have P1 in
his possession.” 7.  Albeit on the papers, appeals of this kind from the Magistrates’Court to the High Court are by way of rehearing.  While due weight
is to be attached to a magistrate’s advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses,the appellate judge will not affirm a conviction
if not satisfied that it is safe.  The Magistrate tried the case conscientiously of course, but has offered noexplanation why PC
5018’s evidence that he found P1 on the Appellant can be safely relied upon even though his evidence that the Appellant made a
verbal admission to him cannot be safely relied upon.  Neither of those twopieces of evidence is materially more susceptible to honest
mistake than the other.  In fairness to PC 5018, it should be stressed that neither anything said by the Magistrate nor anything
said by me involves finding that he had not been honest.  But the Magistrate not having felt it safe to rely upon PC 5018’s evidence
that the Appellant had made an oral admission to him, I am not satisfied that the reliance which the Magistrate placed on PC 5018’sevidence
of finding P1 on the Appellant is safe.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the conviction is safe. 8.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed.",Date of Judgment: 14 May 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1258.html,"

far, which appears to be an earnest effort on her part to assist the authorities.  A chronology has been prepared by the prosecution
which was submitted on 11 May 2018 which details the inquiries and the results in relation to the defendant’s assistance to the
authorities.  However, I am informed that at this stage, the assistance provided by the defendant has not been appropriately confirmed
and evaluated and therefore cannot be taken into account in the sentence to be passed on the defendant.  If anything is to arise
in the future, there is the procedure of making an application to the executive for any valuable assistance provided to the authorities
that could properly be taken into account in adjusting a sentence that has already been imposed. 37.  According to the tariff guidelines, a starting point of 23 years and 9 months’ imprisonment is suggested by way of arithmetical
calculation which I will adopt.  I will enhance the starting point for the international element by 2 years.  Accordingly, the enhanced
starting point for sentence is 25 years and 9 months’ imprisonment, which I will reduce by one year for the genuine and positive
participation by the defendant in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign to 24 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.  This term will be reduced

of Administration should have been resolved earlier and that the main issue was the revocation and also the cancellation of the PSPA.
 P had clearly succeeded in these orders sought by him.   However, I am also of the view that P’s delay in applying for grant did
contribute to D thinking P’s oral representation that he had in his possession the Will was false.  Further, P had also made serious
allegations against D on which he was entitled to defend. 54.  The question of costs is governed by s 52A of the High Court Ordinance and in the exercise of discretion, the Court shall also take into account of those matters set out in O 62 r 5 of the Rules of the
High Court, and amongst other things,  (aa) the underlying objectives set out in O 1A r 1; (e) the conduct of all the parties; (f)
whether a party has succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful; (g) any admissible offer to settle
made by a party which is drawn to the Court’s attention. 55.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I have come to the view that P should be entitled to only 80 % of his costs
of this action, including the costs argument to be taxed if not agreed on party and party basis, save and except the costs over the
issue of the cancellation agreement should be paid by D to P on indemnity basis, as stated above. P’s costs to be taxed under Legal Aid Regulations, if applicable.","CHEN CHI LUNG, the Administrator of the estate of WANG MU TAN, deceased

or inconsistencies even at the substantive hearing, there was no finding that this case was brought by Ps with an ulterior motive
or for an improper purpose or that there had been some deception or underhand conduct on the part of Ps.  There were only unexplained
inconsistencies and this was the main basis why this Court was of the view that the central part of P’s pleadings were so defective
that it was not a matter of simple amendment but of reconstituting the claim.  On such basis, the SOC and the action were struck
out as an abuse of process. 27.  Having considered all the circumstances of this case including time was spent by P on an unnecessary issue, even though there were
unexplained inconsistencies, I have come to the view that there were no special or unusual features in this matter to justify an
order of costs on indemnity basis.  I therefore dismiss Ds’ application for variation of the Order Nisi. 28.  Costs of the application should follow the event and be paid by Ds.  However, I am of the view that this matter can be dealt with
by one counsel, and I will not grant certificate for two counsel. ","JOIN RIGHT INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

"HKSAR v. SERRADJ, KAMEL [2018] HKCFI 1023; HCMA 648/2017 (17 May 2018)","38.  In my judgment, the starting point of 22 ½ months taken by the Magistrate for Charge 3 was much too high, bearing in mind the usual
starting point taken for an offence of possessing a false visa is 12 months.  With the aforesaid aggravating features in mind, for
Charge 3, a starting point of 15 months’ imprisonment is appropriate.  On a plea of guilty, the sentence should be 10 months’
imprisonment.  I agree with the Magistrate who, with admirable fairness, accepted in his Reasons for Sentence that “On reflection,
the proper starting point for the third charge should in all the circumstances also have been 15 months’ imprisonment, to be reduced
to 10 months on the defendant guilty plea.  To that extent, the sentence for the third charge was in error.” 39.  The Magistrate was also right to order the sentences for the three charges to run concurrently as they arose out of the same incident. 40.  For the reasons given, I allow the appeal to the extent that the sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for Charge 3 is reduced to
10 months’ imprisonment.  The sentences for Charges 1 and 2 and the other that the sentences for all three charges are to run concurrently

steps that it is likely to take with regard to the complaint.  It is not known whether a formal investigation will be commenced.
A reference to the Commission under s 118(1) is not to be lightly made.  Nor is it necessary in the circumstances of this case. 
The evidence available before this court at this stage, whilst in my view sufficient to show triable issues, does not warrant a reference
by this court to the Commission.  The power to stay under s 118(2) therefore does not arise.  Nor do I consider it appropriate under
the general powers of the court to stay the action pending the Commission’s disposal of the defendant’s complaint. 44.  For the reasons above, I would give leave for the defendant to defend the action on the condition of payment of HK$4.43 million

WADDINGTON LTD v. CHAN CHUN HOO THOMAS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1113; HCA 3291/2003 (17 May 2018),"22.  On behalf of the Plaintiff, Mr Lam applied, belatedly at the hearing on 14 May 2018, for relief from sanction under Order 2, rule
5.  That rule provides as follows:- 23.  No prior notice of intention to apply for relief from sanction was given by Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that it was plainly
aware, from Mr Law’s Skeleton Argument dated 10 May 2018, that the 5th Defendant would rely on Order 2, rule 4 to resist the Summons.  Further, it is clear from Order 2, rule 5 that a range of matters
mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) thereof have to be considered before the court may grant relief from sanction under that rule.
 Quite apart from the requirement in rule 5(2) that the application must be supported by evidence, it seems to me to be clear, as
a matter of procedural fairness, that a party intending to apply for relief from sanction must give proper notice of the application
to the other side so that it will have an opportunity, if so advised, to file evidence which may be relevant to the matters mentioned
in sub-paragraphs (a) to (j) to resist the application.  This was not done.  I am therefore not prepared to entertain the Plaintiff’s
oral application made at the hearing for relief from sanction under Order 2, rule 5. 24.  There is, I consider, no answer to Mr Law’s submission that the Plaintiff’s application for an extension of time to comply with
paragraph 2 of the March 2018 Order is misconceived.  Accordingly, the Summons is dismissed with costs to the 5th Defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.","PROFIT POINT LIMITED

I wish to make an observation on the procedure for leave application in a matter of the present type. 84.  There was in this case an inter parte leave application which was heard in January 2017.  Following the judgment where DHCJ Lee
gave leave to appeal, there was an application by Bauer for leave to appeal against that judgment.  That resulted in another hearing
on 16 May 2017 and a Ruling by the learned Deputy Judge dated 26 May 2017.  Dissatisfied with the Ruling, Bauer then sought leave
from the Court of Appeal.  That application was heard and dismissed on 24 August 2017 with Reasons for Judgment and Decision on Costs
given on 4 September 2017.  85.  Speaking for myself, I would have found it quite difficult to determine the application for leave to appeal against Award (1) without
getting into much details and a great deal of assistance by counsel on both sides.  I believe that there is scope for a roll-up hearing
for the leave application, which is sometimes adopted in judicial review proceedings, in an usually difficult case.  The decision
whether to adopt such a procedure is of course that of the judge seized of the matter.  This procedure has the attractions of speed
and saving of costs.  It will be in line with the underlying objectives embodied in O1A, r 1.",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1057.html,"

CITIBANK N.A. v. THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1102; HCMP 624/2018 (18 May 2018),"13.  Further, it should have been apparent to the defendant banks that the scope of discovery sought by Citibank is far too wide and
unnecessary for the stated purpose of the application.  Yet, neither of them appeared at the hearing on 17 May 2018 or otherwise
rendered assistance to the court.  According to Citibank’s solicitors, HSBC has not responded at all since being served with the
originating summons and the evidence in support of the same while HSB has by a letter dated 7 May 2018 to Citibank’s solicitors
indicated neutrality towards the present application and merely asked for more time to comply with the order. 14.  The individuals and companies whose documents and information are sought by Citibank are not before the court (or even given notice)
to speak for themselves or protect their own interests.  They are however customers of HSBC and HSB.  The banks owe each such customer
a duty of confidentiality in respect of the documents and information applied for.  Any order for disclosure, whether wide or narrow,
would involve a breach of confidentiality by the banks (though condoned by the court order).   15.  That being the case, a respondent to a Norwich Pharmacal application in the position of the defendant banks here should not just sit back and wait and see how the court would dispose of
the application.  Rather, I would expect it to fulfil its duty to the customer affected by scrutinising the application with care
and, where there is a reasonable/proper ground of objection, to protect its customer’s interest and to render assistance to the court by raising and arguing such objection.
 Needless to say, any costs reasonably incurred for such purposes would be recoverable from the applicant.",Date of Handing Down of Reasons for Decision: 18 May 2018(Lisa Wong),Judge of the Court of First Instance,/2018/1102.html,"

The Magistrate of course went about his task conscientiously, and had the advantage of receiving the evidence at first-hand.  But
an appeal like this one is by way of rehearing albeit on the papers.  That caninvolve, and does in the present case involve, scrutiny
on appeal of the state of the direct evidence, the state of the circumstantial evidence and the state of the two combined.  In my
judgment, the evidence in the present case did not make it safe to convict. 13.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed.",Date of Judgment: 18 May 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1272.html,"

CHOW STEEL INDUSTRIES PUBLIC CO LTD AND OTHERS v. KO SUNG AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1622; HCMP 2711/2017 (18 May 2018),"24.  The only other issue which arose as a result of this adjournment is whether the current position in terms of security for costs
and fortification is appropriate.  I note what was stated at the hearing before Madam Justice Lisa Wong where this was first considered.
 It seems to me that this is a matter which the Court can always revisit.  I do not consider that the only reason why fortification
should now be considered is because of a delay as a result of filing of late evidence.  At the end of the day even if the Court had
proceeded to hear the argument, unless judgment was to be delivered immediately there would be a time gap between the hearing and
delivery of the judgment.  And during that period a loss could conceivably arise by reason of the defendants having suffered by reason
of the injunction, which later transpired should not have been granted. 25.  I have regard to the financial statements which were in the evidence produced by the 1st plaintiff and some of the criticisms which were made by the defendants as regards the financial situation of the plaintiffs and their
debt position.  I do not intend to conduct a scientific exercise.  Suffice to say that the 1st plaintiff is out of the jurisdiction and there is no suggestion that it has assets, whether of a fixed or liquid nature, within the
jurisdiction. 26.  Having considered that there might be an adjournment of a matter of weeks or perhaps a couple of months, it seems to me that having
regard to the amounts which have been disclosed by the defendants currently subject to a Mareva injunction, that the amount of HK$1 million being interim fortification would be appropriate.","PREMIER SOLUTIONS CONSULTANCY LIMITED

T v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 1004; HCAL 166/2017 (23 May 2018),"70.  I do note that the new evidence the applicant hoped to submit related to witnesses supporting his evidence “in regard to his employment
with and/or risk of harm arising from the perpetrators of harm (Geoff and George and their associates) in this case.”  This evidence
would not have taken ground 1 any further.  Also, the adjudicator essentially accepted what had happened to the applicant when he
was young until he was about 16 living with Geoff and accepted how he came to be employed by George and how that employment came
to an end. 71.  After a careful examination of the grounds and submissions, I do not find any ground that shows there was an error of law by the
adjudicator.  I see no evidence of procedural unfairness nor a failure to adhere to the high standard of fairness required.  The
substantive decision did satisfy the enhanced Wednesbury test; it was not Wednesbury unreasonable. 72.  None of the grounds put forward by the applicant were arguable so as to satisfy the test in Peter Po Fun Chan v Winnie CW Chan & anor [2007] HKCFA 77;  (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676 §14-17.

reason which prevented me from drawing the inference that the Second Oral Agreement is inherently probable is my reservation about
Suen’s credibility.  I have mentioned about his dishonesty in: 136.  Kong Cheong, Ko Kan or Kuang, but not the Plaintiff, may havea good claim against Suen or Wui San for the balance of compensation
in the sum of $90 million payable upon execution of the certificate of transfer of the Land.  However, that is not what this action
is about.  This action is not about the rights or wrongs of those parties in the background transactions, but about the rights and
obligations of the Plaintiff and Suen or of Suen and Ko Kan under their alleged agreements made to settle the disputes relating to
those background transactions.  The core issue in the original action is whether the Plaintiff and Suen had entered into the Verbal
Agreement to procureKong Cheong to execute the certificate of transfer for an intermediary fee of $95 million; or in the counterclaim
whether Suen and Ko Kan had entered into the First and Second Oral Agreements to procure Kong Cheong to delivervacant possession
of the Land and to clear all its encumbrances for a fee of $105 million.  The Plaintiff bears the burden of proof in the original
action; while Suen and Wui San bear the burden of proof in the counterclaim.  137.  In the ultimate analysis, I find that all the witnesses of the parties were incredible and not telling the whole truth.  I reluctantly
come to the conclusion that the parties have failed to discharge their respective burden of proof.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s
claim in the original action and the defendants’ claim in the counterclaim are dismissed.  I make a costs order nisi that there be no order as to costs in both the original action and the counterclaim.",Date of Judgment: 24 May 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1134.html,"

for the defendant to make application for restoration of the same has not expired (which will soon do on 28 May 2018).  The trial
has however taken place.  Rather than to wait for the expiry of the three-month period, I now formally dismiss the counterclaim. 13.  In the circumstances, and having heard the evidence, I allow the plaintiff’s claim and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim.
 I give judgment to the plaintiff in the said sum of HK$5,322,020.  I further order that costs of both the claim and counterclaim
be to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed. 14.  As to interest, I note that there was a substantial time gap between the accrual of the cause of action and the commencement of
the present action.  I do not deem it fair to order pre-judgment interest for the entire period.  I note that on 19 August 2013,
the plaintiff through a firm of lawyers in the Mainland formally issued a letter of demand to the defendant for payment of the outstanding
sums.  That date appears to me to be a fair starting point for pre-judgment interest to run.  Having heard Mr Chow, I award pre-judgment
interest on that sum of HK$5,322,020 at the rate of prime plus 1% from 19 August 2013 to the date of this judgment, and thereafter

use his bank loans for payment of Mr Jim’s share of $4.8 million.  Bearing in mind the circumstances of Mr Leung’s initial approach
to Mr Jim to solicit his interest in financing the Project, and their close relationship at the material time, I am satisfied on
the evidence that Mr Leung was aware that Mr Jim had to obtain a loan from the bank to finance the Project.  He had in fact accompanied
Mr Jim to the bank when Mr Jim applied for the initial loan. 52.  I allow Mr Jim’s claim that Mr Leung should pay interest on the sum of $4.8 million, at the commercial rate of interest paid by
Mr Jim under his loan agreements with the banks, in the sum of $2,290,931.66, as damages for Mr Leung’s breach of the JV Agreement. 53.  As the Plaintiffs have succeeded in their claims, it follows that the costs of the proceedings, including the counterclaim, should

in Hebei, come close to justifying the setting aside of the Enforcement Order on the public policy ground. 30.  For completeness sake, I should also mention the question of leave to extend time.  In the Setting Aside Summons, Capxon seeks “leave
to extend the time within which the application for the order under this Summons should be made until the date hereof should this Honourable Court consider that such application is made out of time” (emphasis added).  Capxon’s primary contention is that as the service of the Enforcement Order was ineffective, the time for
it to apply to have it set aside has not started to run.  I do not intend to go into the issue of service unnecessarilyand on such
contingency basis.  I will only say this.  If extension of timeis required, I will refuse to grant any.  I have considered the overall
justice of the case.  I avoid the application of any rigid mechanistic approach.  On the basis of my conclusion expressed above on
the lack of any basis to challenge the Enforcement Order, it would have been futile for me to grant any extension. 31.  At the end of the hearing on 2 May 2018, I dismissed the Setting Aside Summons with costs to Paloma on an indemnity basis.  I promised

For these reasons, I conclude that, notwithstanding its evolution with changing times, attitudes and values, the common law of Hong
Kong, as it has developed up to today, does not recognise a cause of action for wrongful life or wrongful suffering. 55.  I order that the 1st plaintiff’s claim against the defendant be struck out on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action. I dismiss
the 1st plaintiff’s action against the defendant.  I make a costs order nisi that the 1st plaintiff pays to the defendant the costs of the action incurred by the defendant that were over and above the costs incurred to
defend the 2nd plaintiff’s claims, to be taxed if not agreed; and, further, that the 1st plaintiff pays the costs of the strike out application and of the hearing on 16 March 2018 to the defendant, to be taxed if not agreed,
with Certificate for 2 Counsel; and, finally, that the 1st plaintiff’s own costs be taxed pursuant to the Legal Aid Regulations. 56.  I cannot conclude without expressing my gratitude to counsel for their detailed submissions and extensive researches which spanned
the greater part of the common law world as well as many European jurisdictions.","Section 22A(1):



               
                   Without prejudice to subsection (2), this Part applies in respect of births after (but not before)
the commencement of this Part [ie. 14 April 1978], and in respect of any such birth it replaces any law in force before such commencement whereby a person could be liable to a child
in respect of disabilities with which it might be born; but in section 22B(3) the expression liable in tort( 承擔侵權責任 ) does not include any reference to liability by virtue of this Part, or to liability by virtue of any such law.
                
            



Section 4(5):



                This Act applies in respect of births after (but not before) its passing, and in respect of any such birth it replaces
any law in force before its passing, whereby a person could be liable to a child in respect of disabilities with which it might be
born; but in section 1(3) of this Act the expression “liable in tort” does not include any reference to liability by virtue of
this Act, or to liability by virtue of any such law.Section 22B:



                
                    (1)       If a child is born disabled as the result of such an occurrence before its birth
as is mentioned in subsection (2) and a person (other than the child’s own mother) is under this section answerable to the child
in respect of the occurrence, the child’s disabilities are to be regarded as damage resulting from the wrongful act of that person
and actionable accordingly at the suit of the child.

                   (2)       An occurrence to which this section applies is
one which – (a) affected either parent of the child in his or her ability to have a normal, healthy child; or (b) affected the
mother during her pregnancy, or affected her or the child in the course of its birth, so that the child is born with disabilities
which would not otherwise have been present.

                    (3)       Subject to subsections (4) and (7), a person (hereafter
referred to as the defendant) is answerable to the child if he was liable in tort to the parent or would, if sued in due time, have been so; and it is no answer
that there could not have been such liability because the parent suffered no actionable injury, if there was a breach of legal duty
which, accompanied by injury, would have given rise to liability.

                    (4)       In the case of an occurrence preceding
the time of conception, the defendant is not answerable to the child if at that time either or both of the parents knew the risk
of their child being born disabled (that is to say, the particular risk created by the occurrence); but should it be the child’s
father who is the defendant, this subsection does not apply if he knew of the risk and the mother did not.

                    (5)
      The defendant is not answerable to the child, for anything he did or omitted to do when responsible in a professional capacity
for treating or advising the parent, if he took reasonable care having due regard to then received professional opinion applicable
to the particular class of case; but this does not mean that he is answerable only because he departed from received opinion.

 
                  (6)       Liability to the child under this section may be treated as having been excluded or limited by contract
made with the parent affected, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions as liability in the parent’s own case; and
a contract term which could have been set up by the defendant in an action by the parent, so as to exclude or limit his liability
to him or her, operates in the defendant’s favour to the same, but no greater, extent in an action under this section by the child.

                    (7)       If in the child’s action under this section it is shown that the parent affected share the responsibility
for the child being born disabled, the damages are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard
to the extent of the parent’s responsibility.
               
            



Section 1:



                
                    (1)       If a child is born disabled as the result of such an occurrence before its birth
as is mentioned in subsection (2) below, and a person (other than the child’s own mother) is under this section answerable to the
child in respect of the occurrence, the child’s disabilities are to be regarded as damage resulting from the wrongful act of that
person and actionable accordingly at the suit of the child.

                    (2)       An occurrence to which this section applies
is one which – (a) affected either parent of the child in his or her ability to have a normal, healthy child; or (b) affected the
 mother during her pregnancy, or affected her or the child in the course of its birth, so that the child is born with disabilities
which would not otherwise have been present.

                    (3)       Subject to the following subsections, a person (hereafter
referred to as “the defendant”) is answerable to the child if he was liable in tort to the parent or would, if sued in due time,
have been so; and it is no answer that there could not have been such liability because the parent suffered no actionable injury,
if there was a breach of legal duty which, accompanies by injury, would have given rise to the liability.

                   (4)
      In the case of an occurrence preceding the time of conception, the defendant is not answerable to the child if at that time
either or both of the parents knew the risk of their child being born disabled (that is to say, the particular risk created by the
occurrence); but should it be the child’s father who is the defendant, this subsection does not apply if he knew of the risk and
the mother did not.

                    (5)       The defendant is not answerable to the child, for anything he did or omitted to
do when responsible in a professional capacity for treating or advising the parent, if he took reasonable care having due regard
to then received professional opinion applicable to the particular class of case; but this does not mean that he is answerable only
because he departed from received opinion.

                   (6)       Liability to the child under this section may be treated
as having been excluded or limited by contract made with the parent affected, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions
as liability in the parent’s own case; and a contract term which could have been set up by the defendant in an action by the parent,
so as to exclude or limit his liability to him or her, operates in the defendant’s favour to the same, but no greater, extent in
an action under this section by the child.

                   (7)       If in the child’s action under this section it is shown
that the parent affected shared the responsibility for the child being born disabled, the damages are to be reduced to such extent
as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the extent of the parent’s responsibility.","Section 22C:



                Liability to a child under section 22B is to be regarded – (a) as respects all its incidents and any matters
arising or to arise out of it; and (b) subject to any contrary context or intention, for the purpose of construing references in
enactments and documents to personal or bodily injuries and cognate matters, as liability for personal injuries sustained by the
child immediately after its birth.
            



Section 4(3):


                Liability to a child under section 1 or 2 of this Act is to be regarded – (a) as respects all its incidents and

also satisfied that the Jinan Proceedings were frivolous, vexatious, unconscionable which are bound to fail if defended by the Plaintiff;
that they were commenced as an aid to and give effect to the takeover by the Jinan City Government; that real and tremendous coercion
and pressure had been exerted on the employees to ensure that the takeover would be complete; and that there is a real risk that
steps have been taken to manipulate the Jinan Proceedings to the detriment of the Plaintiff and to deprive him of a fair trial.  63.  There is a divergence in expert opinion on PRC law on the question whether there is a requirement for the Plaintiff to first apply
in the PRC court to stay the Jinan Proceedings.  On the facts of the present case, there are no effective means under the PRC law
to allow the Plaintiff to stop the defendants from pursuing the Jinan Proceedings, or to challenge the PRC court’s jurisdiction
to hear the Jinan Proceedings such that the case should be heard in a foreign court.  The Plaintiff has no choice but to resort to
an anti-suit injunction application in Hong Kong. 64.  For the above reasons, I grant the Anti-suit Injunction Application to the Plaintiff with costs and certificate for two counsel.

in being forced to face this extra witness statement at this late stage of the case.  The time for preparation of the trial should
not be taken away and it is not for the court or the defendant to distil from the brother’s witness statement what is relevant

TOP CATERING DEVELOPMENT LTD v. CHAN SZE NGA FIONA T/A TASTY [2018] HKCFI 979; HCA 1817/2015 (30 May 2018),"60.  It follows that Tasty is liable to pay to Top Catering a net sum of: 61.  I therefore order that Tasty shall pay the sum of $480,862.20 to Top Catering with interest at 1% over the prevailing prime lending
rate of HSBC from the date of writ until the date of this judgment, and therefore at the judgment rate until payment. 62.  As to costs, Top Catering is, overall speaking, the successful party because Tasty is liable to pay a net sum to it.  Top Catering
succeeds on most of its claims whereas Tasty fails on most of its counterclaims (save those which Top Catering has already admitted).
 In the circumstances, Tasty should pay the costs of this action (including both Top Catering’s claims and Tasty’s counterclaims)
to Top Catering.  However, the amount that Top Catering can recover from Tasty is substantially less than the amount of its primary
claim; and it has failed on some items.  Adopting a broad-brush approach, I shall only allow Top Catering to recover 90% of the costs
that it has incurred in this action.  I shall make a costs order nisi that Tasty shall pay 90% of Top Catering’s costs in this action to be taxed if not agreed. If any party intends to apply to vary
the costs order nisi, it shall submit a written application (not more than 3 pages) within 14 days of this judgment, and the other party shall reply in

despite the lack of good explanation for the delay (the Applicant relies on her ignorance about the time limit for leave application),
I would have granted an extension of time in favour of the Applicant by reason of the fact that the delay is not unduly excessive

that every effort was made to accommodate and assist the applicant in his various claims and actions.  He was given a number of opportunities

urgency for the receivership to be discharged pending the publication of the award and no prejudice for the BDO Receivers to remain
in place.  I was not persuaded by this argument.  First, the date of publication of the award had been extended before, and one did
not know that it would not be extended again.  Secondly, as Mr Chan SC submitted for ACC, the true question is whether there was
any further present need for the receivership to continue.  If not, the fact that it would in any event come to an end in due course
was not a reason against immediate discharge.  To say that there would be no harm for the BDO Receivers to continue was to put the
cart before the horse.  Thirdly, the arbitration was not for enforcement of the security such as the sale of pledged shares and the
application of the proceeds for repayment of the loans.  In the arbitration request as finally varied on 21 September 2017, Chen
HQ asked the arbitral tribunal: 31.  Mr Mok also submitted there had been delay on the part of the defendants in taking out the present application.  While it is true
that some of the developments relied upon had emerged some time ago, judgment in the Trust Actions was only given on 31 January 2018,
as a result of which the purchase of shares by Chen HQ could no longer be said to be “conditional” even on his original case.
 Further, Chen HQ’s case that he had irrevocably purchased the employee-plaintiffs’ interests in CSI did not emerge publicly
until the joinder application in the Trust Actions which was heard only on 10 November 2017.  Even if there was delay, there was
no suggestion of any prejudice caused to Chen HQ and I do not consider it should be a bar to relief. 32.

any new claims or causes of action arising from the proposed amendments to items 1 and 3 of Appendix B clearly arise out of the same
or substantially the same facts: regarding the Plaintiff’s execution and omissions in the execution of the Works under the Renovation
Agreement.  21.  In any event, as the Defendant highlighted, the Plaintiff has already prepared and presented its evidence to meet the claim of alleged
breach of the Renovating Clause, by asserting in the witness statement already filed on its behalf that the Plaintiff had already
removed the scaffolding nails from the external walls, and that (on the Plaintiff’s case) the scope of the Renovation Agreement
does not include the removal of pre-existing nails on the external walls which did not require repair.  The trial of this action
is set down for February 2019, and I cannot see how the Plaintiff is prejudiced in its preparation for trial as a result of the amendment
to item 1 of Appendix B. 22.  For all the above reasons, the Defendant’s application for amendment is allowed, and I make an order in terms of paragraphs 1

or otherwise of a demand for repayment can be determined by the defendant’s board.  It is something to be decided objectively.
 I agreement with Mr Lam.  Therefore, I would give summary judgment to the plaintiffs on this further ground that the demands are
reasonable and not arbitrary and the approval from the defendant’s board is not required. 28.  Though the unjust enrichment claim is defective, it could have been made good by a simple amendment to the effect that it was unjust
for the defendant to hold on to the loans which are interest free and without fixed term of repayment as the plaintiffs are no longer
shareholders of the defendant and have no interest in it.  To allow the defendant to keep the loans at the plaintiffs’ expense
is unjust to the plaintiffs and to enrich the defendant unjustly.  But even if the unjust enrichment claim is defective, it was not
necessary to have it struck out as summary judgment should have been given under the claim for repayment.  29.  In the premises, I allow the appeal and give summary judgment to the plaintiffs for the sums of HKD862,848.72, HKD647,136.55 and
HKD2,148,493.30 respectively.  I also order that interest to accrue on the said sums at the rate of 1% over the Hong Kong Dollar

of the case. 36.  In my view, as the trial was set down for 10 days, there should be sufficient time for D to take instructions on the emails. I accept
that there would be prejudice to D due to the lateness but there was no sufficient evidence that there needed to be an adjournment
of the trial or there would be any serious disruption to the trial.  As I have said, the emails were contemporaneous documents and
on the face of it, they would be relevant and necessary in relation to 3 of the disputed issues in the Scott Schedule. Having weighed

RE HONG KONG SPORTS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT LTD (FORMERLY KNOWN AS “LETV SPORTS CULTURE DEVELOP (HONG KONG) CO LTD”) [2018] HKCFI 1309; HCCW 66/2018 (4 June 2018),"4.  The Company was given a 14-day extension of time to serve an affirmation in opposition on 16 May 2018.  The affirmation that has
been filed on behalf of the Company by Mr Zhang Lei, in my view, clearly does not explain why at least a sum of US$12,905,000 is
not payable.  It does not seem to me that the payment of at least that sum is an issue in dispute in the arbitration.  5.  That being the case, there is no evidence before the court which demonstrate a bona fide defence on substantial grounds to the claim for that sum and I can see no justification for requiring the arbitration to be completed
before allowing the petitioners to petition to wind up the Company for the significant debt which, on the basis of the evidence before
me, is indisputably payable to them. 6.  I will therefore make the

 Mr Ho argued that the interest entitlement should be reduced by reason of the delay in launching this action.  On balance, I am
not convinced that the interest entitlement should be reduced.  These are commercial entities, and Joinland has benefited from not
having to pay the balance of the purchase price.  88.  I award interest in favour of Volly Best at prime plus 1% for all its loss from date of resale to date of judgment, and thereafter

of the concerns raised, Liu fairly agreed to step down, and Yeo had agreed to step in as a Liquidator with his colleague Chan as
the other Liquidator. 61.  As explained above, the court may on cause shown make an order for removal of a liquidator and appoint another one as consequential
relief. But there must be proper cause shown and not “if the court shall think fit”.[22] Here, both the Registrar and OR adopted a neutral stance, and papers had been filed to show Yeo’s and Chan’s fitness and experience

brought derivatively on behalf of the Company should be proceeded with.  It will also be for them to determine whether there have
been any other wrongs committed to the Company or whether criminal offences have been committed, and if so, take appropriate action. 29.  In the light of the issues I have highlighted, both parties agreed that the proper course was for me to adjourn the proceedings

for my taste.  The cogency or otherwise of the reasons for a party wanting to rely on another expert is simply one of the factors—‌admittedly
a very important one‌—‌to be taken into account in the balancing exercise.  But that is not something which I need to decide
because, for the reasons I have already given, the reasons for questioning the basis on which Mr Leung excluded the possibility that
the difference between Madam Chan’s known signatures and the signature on the document in question was attributable to different
authorship rather than the state of her health are far from fanciful.  And when it comes to the balancing exercise, I have no doubt
that the court will beassisted by knowing the extent to which Mr Leung and Mr Radley continue todisagree about whether it is possible
to attribute those differences to different authorship—not least because by then the court should be satisfied that Mr Leung has
indeed considered the documents which relate to Madam Chan’s medical condition. 32.  For these reasons, I adjourn Mr Ho’s application for leave to rely on Mr Radley’s report at the trial of the action.  In case
Mr Leung has not been provided with the documents relating to Madam Chan’s medical condition, I order that he be provided with
them within 14 days of this judgment, to the extent that he has not been provided with them before.  I order that Mr Leung and Mr
Radley discuss their respective opinions within 28 days thereafter, whether in person or by video link or conference call.  I order
that within 21 days thereafter they jointly prepare a report setting out the issues on which they agree and the issues on which they
disagree.  I give the parties liberty to restore the summons to which Mr Ho’s application relates following the receipt of that
joint report. 33.  My current thinking is that it would be premature to make any order for costs.  Accordingly, the order nisi

I would have awarded the sum of $4,000,000.  I would have done so on Mr Man’s acceptance that the defendant would have been permitted
to have traded in some of the trades he made without breach of any duty owed, that the defendant would likely have also engaged in
other permitted trades (in place of those which, for this purpose, are assumed to have been in breach of duty) and that they would
have been affected by the significant market downturn which was shown in evidence by a chart covering the period June to December
2011.  I think it would also be necessary to give credit for the profit taken on trades which were (on this hypothesis) a breach
of duty, and the ex gratia payment.  Doing the best I can with all this material, I think the sum of $4 million would have been appropriate as the damages figure. 175.  As to costs, I make a costs order nisi that the costs follow the event, meaning the defendant will be entitled to his costs of the action (save such time as was spent in

what transpired between D2 and Cecilia Leung in July 2016 would be critical in determining the outcome of the dispute between the

scepticism, the circumstances of the present case are unusual. 39.  Given the available evidence which is far from complete and satisfactory, I am not persuaded that there is no serious issue to be
tried.  In my view, this is hardly a clear case that would warrant summary judgment given the differing versions of what transpired
at the January meeting. It is to be noted that when this summons was taken out on 25 April 2017, the plaintiff had full notice of
the defence being raised. 40.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the plaintiff’s summons dismissed.  There is to be an order nisi that costs of the summons be to the defendants in any event.",Date of Decision: 8 June 2018(Doreen Le Pichon),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1283.html,"

or interest in such estate.  His claims, as earlier mentioned, are for (i) a revocation of the Grant, (ii) an order appointing him
as administrator of the estate of Mr Au, and (iii) an order requiring the Defendant to render a just and true account in respect
of his administration of the estate of Mr Au.  These claims are not, in my view, subject to Section 20(1) (see Re Loftus, Deceased [2006] EWCA Civ 1124;  [2007] 1 WLR 591, at paragraphs 30 and 32 per Chadwick LJ). 18.  It is true that if the Plaintiff’s claim as the adopted son of Mr Au is established, he would be a beneficiary of the estate of
Mr Au and thus entitled to a share or interest in the estate under the Intestates’ Estates Ordinance, Cap 73.  However, as mentioned above, the Plaintiff is not making a claim for any share or interest in the estate of Mr Au in this
action.  In any event, even if the Plaintiff should make such claim, it would be a claim to recover from the Defendant (as administrator)
trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the Defendant falling under Section 20(1)(b) and therefore not caught
by the limitation period prescribed by Section 21. 19.  For the above reasons, I consider that the proposed limitation defence is misconceived.  It follows that the application to amend
is refused.  I shall now hear the parties on the question of costs.",Date of Decision: 8 June 2018(Anderson Chow),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1300.html,"

 Maintenance of his father ought to be a shared burden amongst himself and his two sisters.  This is not unreasonable, quite irrespective
of whether any inference may be drawn from the trustees’ suggestion that the sisters have claimed parents’ dependency allowance
for taxation purpose (which the bankrupt indeed disputed).  The trustees mentioned the possibility of application for old age living
allowance, but that would really be subject to test of eligibility.  So I would say no more about its possible relevance in the balancing
exercise. 8.  The bankrupt has failed to show, either by evidence or his representation to the court, that the trustees have erred or failed to
properly exercise their discretion in the circumstances of the case. I therefore see no valid basis for interfering with their decision. 9.  The application is dismissed.

on 6 June 2018, to be taxed if not agreed. 35.  In so far as the Petitioner’s own costs are concerned, I am not minded to allow legal aid taxation, because those costs have been
incurred as a result of what I regard to be elementary mistakes on the part of the Petitioner’s legal adviser(s) who have acted
well below the standard that could reasonably be expected of reasonably competent lawyers.  In this regard, in addition to the mistake
in using the incorrect form of application originally, there was a failure to apply for directions promptly on 17 May 2018 even though
they had been alerted by the court of the mistake, and also a failure to apply for an extension of time to issue the Inter Partes
Directions Summons until the hearing on 6 June 2018 notwithstanding the Department of Justice’s letters dated 24 and 29 May 2018
respectively.  In my view, the mistakes and shortcomings are quite inexcusable, and costs have been unnecessarily incurred and wasted.
 However, in case there should be some other relevant matters which I am not aware of or which I ought to have taken into account
in deciding whether to disallow legal aid taxation, the order disallowing legal aid taxation is an order nisi only, with liberty to the Petitioner or his legal advisers to apply for a variation of the same within 14 days from the date of this
decision.",Date of Decision: 11 June 2018(Anderson Chow),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1290.html,"

powers as to the manner in which the Originating Summons should proceed and be heard.  See: Order 28, rule 4; Ye Hong-ying v Chan Lup-ying [1996] 1 HKLR 255 per Keith J at 258H. 9.  The proceedings have been ongoing for some time, with substantial affidavit evidence.  It would not, in my view, be efficient to
order that the matter now continue as if commenced by writ.  Further, the defendant’s concerns as to the fair ventilation of factual
issues can be sufficiently accommodated by making suitable directions within the Originating Summons procedure, including as to discovery
and oral evidence.  10.  For these reasons, I dismissed the defendant’s application under Order 28, rule 8.

HKSAR v. CHAN HO FAI [2018] HKCFI 1316; HCMA 632/2017 (11 June 2018),"11.  The Magistrate having stated in paragraph 39 of her Statement of Findings that “[t]he Defendant has no burden to prove his innocence”,
it is difficult to think that she had gone back on that statement so as consciously to reverse the burden of proof.  But to say (as
the Magistrate said in paragraph 85 of her Statement of Findings) that she “[did] not accept as the truth that the Defendant had
been framed up” is cause for real concern that she might have lost sight of the question which the burden and standard of proof
operated to pose in regard to whether the Appellant had been framed.  That question was not merely whether the Magistrate accepted
that the Appellant had been framed.  It extended to whether she thought that he might have been framed.  I do not think that the
Magistrate’s statement that she “[did] not accept as the truth that the Defendant had been framed up” can be safely dismissed
as a linguistic slip.  All things considered, I do not regard these convictions as safe. 12.  The appeal is therefore allowed so as to quash these convictions.  Before deciding whether to order that the Appellant be acquitted
or to order a retrial, I will hear the prosecution on whether they seek a retrial, and if they do, then I will hear both sides on
the question of acquittal or retrial. 13.  The Respondent has declined to seek a retrial, so no retrial is ordered.",Date of Delivery of Judgment: 11 June 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1316.html,"

HKSAR v. LEUNG TIN KEI AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1329; HCCC 408/2016 (11 June 2018),"70.  For the offence of assaulting a police officer which D1 admitted, the principles laid down in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] HKCA 397; [2016] 5 HKLRD 1 concerning the discount given on a guilty plea are applicable.  As the prosecution only added this charge after the committal proceedings
and after the listing of this case, D1 did not have the chance to plead guilty at any earlier stage.  As such, I would regard D1
as having pleaded guilty to this charge at the earliest opportunity and I am going to give him the full one-third discount.  18 months
being the starting point, the sentence is 12 months’ imprisonment after a one-third reduction. 71.  Since the offence of riot and the offence of assaulting a police officer arose from the same set of facts, and having considered
the totality principle, I order the sentences of these two offences to run concurrently.  D1 is therefore sentenced to imprisonment
for 6 years in total for these two offences. 72.  As for the offence of riot admitted by D5, Ngo Van Nam is also applicable.  Since D5 only pleaded guilty after the listing of the case, he is not entitled to the full one-third discount.
 However, I would give him a discount of about 23%.  Apart from this, his personal background does not constitute a mitigating factor
in offences as serious as this.  Therefore, I order that D5 be sentenced to imprisonment for 3½ years for the offence of riot at
Argyle Street, which he admitted.",(Anthea Pang)Judge of the Court of First Instance of,the High Court,/2018/1329.html,"

LAW PO LIN v. HAU KWAI FAT AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1345; HCA 1443/2014 (14 June 2018),"46.  Enclosing land is strong evidence of manifestation of possession.  Mr Sherry argues that there is no evidence who erected the fence
enclosing the relevant part of the Land and there is a possibility that it was erected by the previous owners.  It is not the defendants’
evidence that the fence was erected by them or the Tong or their predecessor in title. It does not matter who erected the fence.
 What matters is who put the lock on the gate.  The undisputed evidence is that the lock was installed by the Father in his lifetime
and then the Mother.  That is strong evidence of manifestation of possession to the exclusion of the whole world including the defendants. 47.  There are other trivial arguments raised by Mr Sherry. I do not find it necessary to deal with them other than to say that I do
not agreewith those arguments.  Accordingly, I find that with effect from the date of LK&Co’s letter of 19 April 1995, the
Mother started to be in joint adverse possession of the Land with the Father.  Upon the Father’s death on 19 December 2005, the
Mother assumed sole adverse possession of the Land against the defendants.  The defendants and their predecessor in title had been
dispossessed of the Land for 57 years.  The Mother started joint adverse possession of the Land with the Father since 1995 and was
in such possession until her death on 15 May 2015.  The defendants’ right to recover the Land has long been lost and their title
extinguished by virtue of sections 7 and 17 of the Limitation Ordinance.  The defendants are absentee landlords.  They only have themselves to blame for not following through with their actions in 1995.
 48.  I am satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a case of adverse possession over the relevant part of the Land against the defendants.
 Accordingly, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants and grant her the order sought subject to the minor
amendments to be made to Annexure I of the Statement of Claim as to the precise boundary of the relevant part.  The defendants’
counterclaim is dismissed.  I also make a costs order that the plaintiff shall have costs of the action against the defendants.","(By Original Writ and by Order of Master R. Yu of the High Court to carry on proceedings dated the 1 September

 Mr Ching told me that he made a mistake in believing that leave to appeal was necessary, and an application for leave to apply was
actually made but withdrawn subsequently. Third, as to the merits of the proposed appeal, in general, a judge in chambers will not
allow an appeal from a master’s costs order unless it is unreasonable or the master erred in law (Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018, vol 1, §58/1/6 at p 1119).  The master’s cost order must be so unreasonable in the sense that no reasonable master would and
could have made such an order.  Glory Sky merely argues that the Master’s Assessment on Costs is excessive by repeating the objections
that the Master had already considered.  Glory Sky’s intended appeal does not have any reasonable prospect of success.  For these
reasons, I refuse to extend the time to appeal.  It follows that the 2nd NA shall be dismissed. 46.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the Restoration Summons, the 1st NA and the 2nd NA. 47.  I also order that Glory Sky shall pay Lau the costs of and incidental to the Restoration Summons, the 1st NA and the 2nd NA (including all costs reserved and the costs of this hearing) to be summarily assessed.

RE WONG KUN SHING [2018] HKCFI 1368; HCB 632/2018 (15 June 2018),"6.  In these circumstances, the Petitioner has estimated the value of the 9,999 shares in the company in the amount of share capital
paid up ie HK$9,999. I do not think such an estimate can be faulted even though it has been said that the practice of the bankruptcy
court not to inquire into the correctness of the petitioning creditor’s estimate of the value of a security should not be applied
inflexibly: see Re Choi Chi Kwun [2000] 3 HKC503; Re Choi Wing Cheong (unrep, HCB 16148/2003, 22 December 2004).  7.  The Debtor had no defence to the Petition and all he could say at the hearing was that because the accounts had only been made up
to 2014, he had to ask the accountants to provide updated figures on the financial condition of the company.  That is obviously not
a defence to the Petition; nor does it provide any reason why a bankruptcy order should not be made given that the petitioner has
complied with the requirements of section 6B(1)(b) in stating an estimated value of the security and making clear that the Petition
is not made in respect of the secured part of the debt. 8.  For these reasons, I made the usual bankruptcy order with costs.","EX-PARTE:

the outcome on costs.  For example, Ms Chow submitted that the 2nd Respondent brought contempt proceedings against Mr Kennedy for disclosing the transcripts of her private examination without leave
of the court.  These are separate proceedings the costs of which have been separately dealt with.  They were simply part of the highly
acrimonious battles between the parties. I do not see that the 2nd Respondent’s ultimate failure (having won in the Court of Appeal) in the contempt proceedings should affect the costs position in
the present proceedings. 25.  For the 2nd Respondent’s part, Mr Barlow referred to certain evidence and alleged that the Applicant had tried to use the criminal proceedings
against the 2nd Respondent to force or induce her to settle the misfeasance claim.  As I stated in my reasons for ruling handed down on 27 October
2016, the Applicant had not had an opportunity of responding to or refuting this allegation.  No finding has been made against him
in this respect.  It would not be right for present purposes to proceed on the basis that there was such wrongdoing on his part. 26.  It is not easy to put the above considerations individually into numerical terms and I do not think it is necessary to put a “value”
on each factor.  In exercising its discretion the court has to take a broad brush rather than an accountant’s pen.  Having regard
to all the circumstances, the order of costs I make is as follows:","KAM SHING

would then have been an objective consideration of whether the only reasonable inference to draw from that description was that all
the elements of indecent assault were duly proved.  But the Magistrate did not confine himself to such an approach.  Complaint is
made on the Appellant’s behalf against the passage in the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings in which he said as follows: 9.  Even an able and experienced Magistrate might occasionally fall into error.  It is submitted on the Appellant’s behalf that the
Magistrate had relied on, and had erred in law in relying on, Alice’s subjective belief that the contact between the Appellant
and her was intentional rather than accidental and was indecent rather than harmless.  From what the Magistrate said, the inescapable
conclusion is that he did indeed, to at least a material extent even if not exclusively, rely on that subjective belief in finding
that such contact was intentional rather accidental and was indecent rather than harmless. For that reason, and even without reference
to the other grounds of appeal, I am of the view that the conviction should be quashed on the basis of an error of law made in arriving
at it and also on the basis that it is neither safe nor satisfactory. 10.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to quash the conviction.",Date of Delivery of Judgment: 15 June 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1389.html,"

retention of EMB by the Mother in Hong Kong on 15 December 2017 was wrongful under Article 3 of the Convention. 82.  The Mother did not raise any other objections to return.  However, there were no proposals made by her on logistics.  Neither were
there any proposals made by the Father until this Court’s enquiry during the hearing.  The Father disclosed that he had surrendered
the lease on the house in Esher and had rented a 2 bedroom fully furnished home in Maidstone in Kent, near his mother which he proposed
to vacate to allow the Mother and EMB to reside therein.  The Father had also put forward other proposals.  There was apparently
a return date in the English Court on 10 August 2018. 83.  As the Father’s proposals were put forward at a late stage, I am not sure what the Mother’s position would be.  Thus, I would
like to hear the parties further in relation to the logistics before I make the order for return.  I therefore fix a hearing on 27
June 2018 at 10:00 am (estimated length of hearing: one hour) to deal with this.    ",Date of Hearing: 12 June 2018Date of Judgment: 19 June 2018,(Bebe Pui Ying Chu) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1344.html,"

FU HON CHIN v. DIRECTOR GENERAL OF CIVIL AVIATION [2018] HKCFI 1366; HCAL 377/2018 (19 June 2018),"45.  This ground can be dealt with shortly.  The Applicant complains that the Director, by a blanket application of Guideline (3) to
reject the Application, has failed to assess his case individually (see paragraph 120 of the Form 86).  There is, however, no evidence
to indicate that the Director has failed to consider the Applicant’s case on its own merits, or has fettered his discretion by
a rigid application of Guideline (3). Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the Applicant was a repeated offender in respect
of dangerous drugs offences with a string of 6 convictions occurring within a period of 6 years, the last of which was only 4 years
prior to the date of the Application, the decision not to grant an ARA Permit to the Applicant in the present case cannot, in my
view, be said to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.  I would add that there is also no point in remitting the matter to the Director for fresh consideration because Mr Ma has
made it clear that the Applicant no longer intends to apply for an ARA Permit. 46.  In all, I consider that all three proposed grounds of judicial review relied upon by the Applicant are not reasonably arguable. 47.  For the foregoing reasons, the present application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed, with no order as to costs.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1366.html,"

 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the decision on costs and its easier comprehension.  It does
not mean those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have also
been considered. 16.  The parties agree that costs should follow the event.  The defendant is effectively the successful party (although only to a limited
extent).  There will accordingly be a costs order that half of the costs of this application (to vary the Jan 2018 order) are to
be paid by plaintiff to the defendant. 17.  I consider summary assessment of costs to be appropriate.  The above costs shall thus be so assessed.  For this purpose:",Date of Decision on Costs: 19 June 2018(Andrew Chung),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1367.html,"

PD v. LTY [2018] HKCFI 1359; HCMP 455/2017 (20 June 2018),"24.  Although the Father originally sought video access to be increased to twice daily at 9:30 am and 9:00 pm Hong Kong time, he is now
prepared to forego the additional morning access (or to arrange earlier access) up to 3 mornings a week, in other words, I understand
that he is seeking access on 4 mornings a week, which the Mother agrees but wants to cancel the night access.  Her reason is that
access at 9 pm is too late and the Child would be tired by then.  However, the time was changed from 8 pm to 9 pm to accommodate
the Mother’s work hours and the time for her to get home to arrange for the access.  The time was agreed to by her on 31 October
2017. There has been no summons taken out by her to vary such access. 25.  Having considered the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the Father should be entitled to additional access, and
I am prepared to vary the 31.10.17 Order and make an order for the Father to have in addition to his access at 9 pm every night,
access on 3 mornings a week at 9:30 am, subject to those terms set out in the 31.10.17 Order.  In my view, such additional access
is in the best interest of the Child. 26.  I make no order as to costs and that both parties’ costs be taxed under Legal Aid Regulations.",Date of Decision: 20 June 2018(Bebe Pui Ying Chu),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1359.html,"

provides, the Hong Kong Court should not undertake any inquiry into the merits of the conviction in the underlying case.  That task
should be left with the court in the designated country and it must be the reason behind section 29(1)(a) which requires the completion
of any appeal proceedings in the designated country. The third ground relied on by the 1st Applicant therefore has no merit in this
application. 46.  Although the 1st Applicant has been absent throughout these proceedings, his interests have been protected by the appointment of
Amicus Curiae to whom this Court is indebted for their assistance.  I am of the view that the enforcement of the External Confiscation Order would
neither be contrary to the interests of justice nor cause any unfairness to the 1st Applicant. 47.  Given the above, the challenges raised by the 1st Applicant are devoid of merit and his application must be dismissed with costs

the 2nd Defendant had said upon arrest.  The exculpatory things which the 2nd Defendant said ought not to have been rejected unless the Magistrate felt sure, on the whole of the evidence, that there was no truth
in them.  On the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings as a whole, that may have been the basis on which the Magistrate actually proceeded.
 There is, however, no getting away from the fact the Magistrate had said in terms that he rejected the exculpatory parts of the
2nd Defendant’s video-recorded interview because he had “grave doubts” as to their truth and that he had “likewise” rejected

August 2007 conferred by the Court’s judgment is an entitlement conferred on D1 alone. That said, D2 will be well aware of the
contents of P’s affirmation and it is inevitable that D2 will become privy to further information and documents provided by P pursuant
to the order that I make herein. I have therefore concluded that both Defendants should be required to provide an express written
undertaking that any further information provided by P pursuant to the said order will be kept confidential save for its use in these
proceedings, which use shall be the sole use to which the information will be put. 9.  In my judgment, given P’s untruthful account of when he began to discuss a possible investment in Xinrui and the relative scarcity
of the discovery he provided for the trial, D1 is entitled to an order that goes wider than might have been conventionally appropriate
in setting the modalities for an account of secret profits to be given by a fiduciary. It is also the case that, since P did not
himself provide the alleged US$ 8million invested in Xinrui, the absence of any profit for CPCB-CF on the US$ 8 million investment
does not necessarily mean that P personally did not benefit financially in one way or another from the investment. 10.  With the considerations identified in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, I order as follows:",Date of Ruling: 26 June 2018(Sir Richard Field),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1448.html,"

it fit to make a costs order nisi at this stage.  The parties are directed to submit the proposed agreed directions for argument on costs within 21 days from the date

down of this Judgment. 445.  With the able handling of this litigation by counsel, no stone has left unturned.  The adjudication of the present case requires
the court to conduct a microscopic analysis of some old documents and to assess the evidence by some senior witnesses.  The task
is by no means an easy one.  Nevertheless, I would like to express my gratitude to counsel for all the assistance they have provided

By reference to the sentencing guidelines in Secretary for Justice v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2008] 3 HKC 323, the Magistrate adopted a starting point of 24 months’ imprisonment.  Having regard to what was said in HKSAR v Shah Syed Arif [2016] HKCA 298; [2016] 4 HKLRD 664, she enhanced the sentence to 26 months’ imprisonment because the Appellant was an asylum- seeker. She found no mitigation by which
to reduce the sentence. 4.  Is the sentence too severe?  In my judgment, it is not.  There is no proper basis on which to interfere with it. 5.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.",Date of Delivery of Judgment: 26 June 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1487.html,"

KWOK HIU KWAN v. CONVOY GLOBAL HOLDINGS LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1729; HCMP 900/2018 (26 June 2018),"23.  There was some discussion before me about the point in time at which the plaintiff should have appreciated the high burden that
he   would have to satisfy in order to succeed in getting an interlocutory injunction.  It seems to me that the position was this:
once, which would have been following reading the announcement of 13 June 2018, it was appreciated that a share sale and purchase
agreement had been executed for the purchase of the entire of CCL’s interest in First Credit, namely, 29.5%, it should have been
appreciated for the reasons explained in Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies (9th ed), p 66–67 that the agreement was probably specifically enforceable, with the consequences for the criteria which had to be satisfied
explained in my earlier reasons. 24.  It seems to me that it is appropriate where an allegation is made of serious misconduct against directors of a public company and
the purchaser of shares in it, that in the event that the applicant is unable to even satisfy the serious question to be tried test,
costs should be assessed on the basis that the defendant should not be out of pocket.  25.  It, therefore, follows in my view that it is appropriate to order that the defendants’ costs and Mr Xiao’s costs are paid on
an indemnity basis with certificate for two counsel.",Date of Decision: 26 June 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1729.html,"

LEE CHICK CHOI v. THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AID [2018] HKCFI 1423; HCAL 417/2018 (27 June 2018),"23.  Fourth, there is no useful purpose to be served by granting the Applicant leave to apply for judicial review of the Decision, because
the District Court Action has come to an end.  There is no question of the Director now granting legal aid to the Applicant to pursue
an action which has already been struck out.  The fact that the Applicant has a pending application for leave to appeal against the
decision of H H Judge Andrew Li dated 24 April 2018 is irrelevant, because neither an appeal nor an application for leave to appeal
operates as a stay of the relevant decision. 24.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to apply for judicial review, and the application for an extension of time
to apply for leave, are dismissed. 25.  On the question of costs, the two applications are, in my view, completely unmeritorious.  Further, the Applicant failed to set
out all the relevant background facts in his affirmation filed in support of the leave application, which led to the court directing
the Director to file evidence and to attend the hearing to resist the application.  Also, the Director’s participation at the oral
hearing has been of substantial assistance to the court in reaching its decision on whether to grant leave to apply for judicial
review in the instant case.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the Applicant should bear the Director’s costs in this matter,
to be taxed if not agreed.  I so order.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1423.html,"

AFFLUENT CONSTRUCTION CO LTD T/A PO LAM CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CO v. YU CHEUNG YIN [2018] HKCFI 1452; HCA 329/2016 (27 June 2018),"113.  A finding that the contractor was 46 days ahead in a 120 working days’ contract may appear impossible.  This result was reached
primarily because of the plaintiff’s foresight and efforts in mitigating the defendant’s mistake.  The plaintiff used extra strong
Type II sheet piles atextra costs in anticipation that approval for the use of this sheet piles would be given and carried on work
at its own risk before the suspension was ordered.  If approval were not given, the plaintiff would suffer double loss.  The use
of Type II sheet piles was approved.  The plaintiff’s foresight turned out to be correct and the extra costs well spent.  By assuming
the risk, the plaintiff gained time before suspension was ordered.  It deserves the credit for its foresight and assumption of risk.
 Even if I were to count the delay from 15 November 2012 instead of from 18 October 2012 (which will result in a reduction of 19
working days)[14], the plaintiff would still be comfortably within time by being 27 days ahead. Another reason was because the defendant took 26 days
to come up with a decision on the installation of the starter bars.  Accordingly, the defendant’s counterclaim must be dismissed. 114.  For the above reasons, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff on its claim for outstanding contract sum in the amount of $241,400
and costs of additional works in the amount of $110,250, totaling $351,650 with interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the rate
of one percent over prime rate from the date of issue of the writ in the District Courtuntil the date of judgment and thereafter
at judgment rate until payment. The defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed. 115.  I also make a costs order nisi that the defendant shall pay the plaintiff’s costs of this action and all costs reserved, if any, at the scale in the High Court.",Date of Judgment: 27 June 2018( Anthony To ),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1452.html,"

The Defendants have, through Clara’s submission this morning, asked for at least 90 days (as opposed to the 28 days sought in
Father’s summons) to prepare the accounts.  I am prepared to give the Defendants 60 days, giving allowance for their unrepresented
status in this action.  I am however not convinced by Clara’s general and vague reference to anticipated difficulties arising from
the long lapse of time, the volume of the materials to go through and the possible needs for the Defendants to obtain documents and
information from third parties such as banks and go to professionals such as accountants for assistance.  Despite the passage of
time, the accounts ordered are of a relatively straightforward nature.  The accounts were ordered back in September 2016.  Despite
their application for leave to appeal out of time and stay of execution, the Defendants should have been prepared to be called upon
to produce the accounts since the last quarter of 2016.  24.  I further make an order nisi that the Defendants should pay Father’s costs of and occasioned by Father’s summons dated 27 April 2018, to be taxed if not agreed

I proceeded on the basis that those two states of mind were distinct, separate and
inconsistent.  The convictions were not affirmed on the basis that such convictions can be based on both of those two states of mind.
 I treated the more serious state of mind as not having been found proved.  As to the less serious state of mind, I found no proper
basis on which to say that the Magistrate was not entitled to come to the conclusion the 1st Defendant was dealing with the sums concerned with at least reasonable grounds to believe that they in whole or in part represented
a person’s proceeds of an indictable offence. 4.  For the foregoing reasons, a certificate is refused.","SUM Ho-wah Howard	(岑浩華)

other substantive hearing).  In particular, documents should be in chronological order without duplication; there is no need for
several bundles of title or security documents where there is no relevant dispute—the parties’ solicitors should sensibly agree
to have sample documents in the bundles.  Further, chronologies should be prepared on the basis that they contain entries for the

It can be seen in paragraphs 76 and 77 of the Judgment that all the other owners agreed that the colouring of the West Yard in the
DMC was wrong.  However, the Lands Tribunal held that the wrong colouring does not matter because the West Yard was still the common
parts of Pak Cheung House.  The West Yard was not exclusively used or occupied by the owner of the Property.  In such case, it would
not reduce the value of the Property for the purpose of the Compulsory Sales Application. 14.  This alone shows that the Plaintiff’s claim in this action is misconceived because the colouring error, even if the Defendant
was responsible for the same, would not cause the deceased’s estate to suffer any damages.  In other words, the rectification does
not serve any purpose. Even if there was justification for the Plaintiff to ask for the rectification, the Plaintiff could not do
so without involving the other owners of Pak Cheung House.  Procedurally, it would be wrong for the Plaintiff to commence the action
against the Defendant alone. 15.  Generally, costs should follow the event, and a party who seeks to withdraw an action has to pay for the costs of the counter party.
 There is no basis for the court to depart from such general principle in the present case.  Indeed, the circumstances here suggest
that it is not necessary to bring the claim against the Defendant.  Hence, I order that the costs of this action, including the costs
of the Striking-out Application, be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant to be taxed if not agreed.",(David Lok)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1501.html,"

MISS LEUNG SO HUNG SIEM v. MR CARSON WEN AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1505; HCA 121/2017 (3 July 2018),"28.  Having reached the view above, there is in fact no need for meto consider the evidence to see whether the claim against D3 is also
frivolous or vexatious, or otherwise an abuse of process.  If necessary, I would find that it is.  What the plaintiff has said, whether
in her affirmation filed in opposition of D3’s Summons or during the appeal hearing to me, do not assist her.  The fact that she
met D1 inside his office within the offices of D3 does not mean that D3 was a party to any agreement she might have reached with
D1. D1’s employment history with D3 equally does not of itself lead to any liability on D3’s part.  Then it was alleged and asserted
that D1 had said that somehow D3 would be involved as the lawyers to the deal.  Quite apart from the hopelessly vague nature of the
allegations, there is no elucidation from the plaintiff as to what D3’s alleged breaches were.  Those allegations and assertions
are incapable of reasoned argument, without foundation and cannot possibly succeed.  29.  By reasons of the above, and principally on the basis that the plaintiff’s proposed appeal lacks merits, I refuse to grant her
leave to appeal against Master J Wong’s Order out of time 30.  In respect of the costs of the present appeal, Mr D’Souza sought summary assessment.  I have considered the Statement of Costs

"HKSAR v. KALEEM, MUHAMMAD [2018] HKCFI 1526; HCMA 200/2018 (3 July 2018)","16.  I have carefully considered the Statement of Findings.  I am in total agreement with the fact‑findings of the magistrate.  The
magistrate has the benefit of seeing and listening to the evidence.  Apart from the observation done by PW2 the policeman, the evidence
of PW1 (that he noticed a non‑local coming to collect the tablecloths at around 3:30 pm on the date in question) was important.
 The story given by the appellant and DW1 was indeed too incredible.  I am also of the view that their story was contrived in order
to explain why the appellant went to the restaurant with Cheung on board the MGV and why he was inside the restaurant and was seen
pushing a cage by PW2. 17.  I am also of the view that on the facts found by the magistrate, the only and irresistible inference to be drawn was that the appellant
was working there.  The evidence also points to the only and irresistible inference that the appellant was “employed” by someone
to work there. 18.  For these reasons, the conviction was not unsafe and I dismiss the appeal.",Date of Hearing and Judgment: 3 July 2018(Judianna Barnes),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1526.html,"

IP PUI LAM ARTHUR AND ANOTHER v. HO YUK WAH DAVID (A BANKRUPT) AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1528; HCA 2587/2017 (3 July 2018),"34.  For the reasons given, I dismiss the summons for leave to appeal and allow the summons for a variation of the costs order nisi to the extent that the Trustees should pay Grassmere its costs of and occasioned by the Discharge Summons forthwith, to be taxed
if not agreed with certificate for two counsel. 35.  Costs should follow the event. For the former summons, Grassmere should pay the costs of the Trustees forthwith, to be taxed if
not agreed.  For the latter summons, the Trustees should pay the costs of Grassmere forthwith, to be taxed if not agreed. Its complexity,
however, does not justify the engagement of two counsel and so I refuse to grant certificate for two counsel. 36.  Lastly, I thank Mr Wong, Mr Kok and Mr Chen for their assistance in this matter. ",Date of Decision: 3 July 2018(Kent Yee),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1528.html,"

LU CHENG LU v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1645; HCMP 2694/2017 (3 July 2018),"6.  On 26 June 2018, another letter was issued by R2’s legal advisers.  The position was maintained that the application was without
merits.  But opposition was withdrawn to save time and costs.  Proposals along the line summarized in paragraph 1 above were made.
 No agreement was reached between the parties—hence this application. 7.  Having considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I am of the view that the litigation conduct on the part of R2, and the
total lack of utility and basis of her objection after sight of the OS and A’s affirmation in support constitute “special and
unusual feature” which justify the ordering of indemnity costs in respect of those incurred after A’s first affirmation in support. 8.  I will proceed to hear parties on the exact terms of the Order.","CHOW YUEN SHA (周婉莎)

if he was willing to conduct the interview.  He said he was.  At no time was it suggested that he told the officers that he did not
wish to take part in the interview—for whatever reason. 25.  The jury should be directed as they will be to consider the reliability of this interview and any admissions in it.  If they thought
that the defendant was in a state of drug withdrawal then this should be considered in determining the reliability of any answers
given or indeed the whole of the interview.",CHAN Ernest(Darryl Saw),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1509.html,"

ZHANG LAN AND OTHERS v. HERBERT SMITH FREEHILLS (A FIRM) [2018] HKCFI 1531; HCMP 285/2016 (4 July 2018),"8.  For the Appeal, I allow Mr Julian Copeman to claim an hourly rate of $4,000.  However, taking into account such seniority, the time
claimed by the Respondent is certainly excessive, in particular the Appeal was a rehearing of the Applicants’ application for taxation.
 The times involved in the perusal of documents and the preparation for the rehearing are excessive, and I doubt whether the Appeal
justifies the involvement of so many fee earners.   Having considered the nature of the Appeal, I summarily assess 75% of the Respondent’s
costs in the sum of $130,000. 9.  For the Stay Summons, I also agree that the costs claimed by the Respondent are excessive.  The summons is not a particularly complicated
one.   I only allow a sum of $70,000. 10.  For the Lifting of Stay Summons, by specifying no certificate for counsel, I expressly took the view that it was not necessary to
engage counsel to deal with the summons.  However, by not engaging counsel, the court should allow the Applicants’ solicitors to
charge more time for the preparation of the hearing.  Items D2 (communication with counsel) and G1 (counsel’s fees) are totally
disallowed.    However, I allow an additional sum of $10,000 for the preparation of the application.  The deductions for the other
items should not be substantial.  Overall, I summarily assess the Applicants’ costs in the sum of $45,000.","andHERBERT SMITH FREEHILLS (A FIRM)

a summons, which does not concern the present appeal, that was not sealed or chopped by the Registrar.  She also mentioned having
received some judgments not sealed by the court; and there were other documents she had discovered recently.  None of these matters
mentioned in her oral submission would assist her in overturning the decision of Master A Ho. 12.  In summary, the order of Master A Ho was plainly correct. I therefore dismiss the appeal. 13.  This appeal is probably a re-run of the arguments before the Master, so I make an order for costs to be borne by the plaintiff,
summarily assessed in the sum of $10,000.",Date of Decision: 4 July 2018(Queeny Au-Yeung),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1738.html,"

In all, the intended application for judicial review has no reasonable prospect of success. 30.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed. 31.  On the question of costs, notwithstanding the usual or prima facie rule that there be no order as to costs in a leave application, I consider that the Applicants ought to pay the BA’s costs in this
instance, because (i) the BA has filed evidence and attended the hearing upon the court’s invitation, (ii) the BA’s evidence
and submissions have been of substantial assistance to the court in determining whether leave to apply for judicial review should
be granted, and (iii) the Applicants have had, effectively, a determination on the merits of their intended application for judicial
review.  The BA’s costs, to be paid by the Applicants, are to be taxed if not agreed.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1507.html,"

Under Order 45 rule 8 of the Rules of the High Court, if a mandatory order is not complied with, then, without prejudice to its powers to punish the disobedient
party for contempt, the Court may direct that the act required to be done may, so far as practicable, be done by some other person
appointed by the Court, at the cost of the disobedient party, and upon the act being done the expenses incurred may be ascertained
in such manner as the Court may direct and execution may issue against the disobedient party for the amount so ascertained and for
costs. 36.  As set out earlier, the preparation of the Inventory is part of the duties of an administrator, and the new administrator will have
to prepare the Inventory.  As I have said the fees and expenses of the preparation of Inventory should be part of the administration
costs of the Estate.  I am not convinced that it was necessary for P to take out the Order 45 Summons as in my view the orders and
directions he sought in the Order 45 Summons could be part of the consequential reliefs under the restored originating summons.

In Universal Capital Bank v Hongkong Heya Co Ltd [2016] HKCFI 438; [2016] 2 HKLRD 757, in rejecting the defendant’s opposition on the basis that the plaintiff’s application was caught by the “fraud” exception,
Deputy High Court Judge Burrell said at [18(1)]: 15.  I find the latter observation equally apt in this instance.  Although a fraud perpetrated by unknown fraudster(s) is the underlying
reason why the plaintiff has suffered loss and commenced these proceedings, the plaintiff stresses that it does not have evidence,
and is not suggesting, that the 3rd defendant or those behind it were involved in such fraud.  The plaintiff has expressly confined its claim against the 3rd defendant to restitution based on unjust enrichment, to be approached in accordance with the framework set out by the Court of Final
Appeal in Shanghai Tongji Science & Technology Industrial Company Limited v Casil Clearing Limited [2004] HKCFA 21;  (2004) 7 HKCFAR 79 at  [67].  That is to say, all that the plaintiff has to say and prove is (1) that the 3rd defendant was enriched by having funds belonging to the plaintiff transferred into its account without having provided any consideration
therefor; (2) that such enrichment was at the expense of the plaintiff who did not intend the 3rd defendant to have, and who had no reason to pay the 3rd defendant, the funds; (3) that such enrichment was unjust as there was no legitimate reason for the 3rd defendant to have received the funds; and (4) that the 3rd defendant has not raised any defence that justifies it to keep the funds.  It is unnecessary for the plaintiff to, and it did not,
assert that the 3rd defendant received the funds in question fraudulently or dishonestly.  See paragraphs 33b, 35a, 37a, 40, 43, 44, 59c, 60c and 61c
of the amended statement of claim.  See also paragraph 8 of the 2nd affidavit of David Michael Wertheim. 16.  For these reasons, I make an order in terms of the draft judgment at pages 192-197 of the hearing bundle save that the words “when

GUAGUAS MUNICIPALES S.A v. BRIGHT MOON INTERNATIONAL TRADE CO. LTD [2018] HKCFI 1716; HCA 472/2018 (10 July 2018),"4.  On 22 June 2018, the plaintiff took out the present application.  I have read the affirmations of service of Fu Man Kit and Foo
Tsang Tsang.  The summons and the documents in support have been served upon the defendant and ICBC.  The defendant has failed to
appear.  ICBC has also failed to respond. 5.  I have considered Order 32, rule 5 of the Rules of the High Court.  I bear in mind the fact that the defendant has all alone ignored
the legal proceedings against it.  I also bear in mind the fraudulent conduct alleged (and now taken to have been substantiated in
the light of the default judgment) against it.  I deem it expedient to proceed with this application in the absence of the defendant. 6.  I have considered the evidence filed before this Court.  I have considered the submissions made by Ms Fiona Chong.  I have considered
the authorities cited in support.  I have previously, echoing the warning made in previous authorities, observed that the powers
which the Court is now being invited to invoke have to be exercised with great caution.  It is important to maintain banker/customer
confidence.  I have on the other hand in Akbank TAS v Mainford Limited & Ors [2018] HKCFI 363 (unreported, HCA 3264/2016, 22 February 2018) observed that Hong Kong being an international city, the law should
be facilitative but not obstructive when a victim of a cybercrime comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the true culprits.
 It is a balancing exercise which the Court has to undertake.  In the present case, I note that the defendant has ignored all the
legal proceedings that have been brought against it.  In particular, it has failed to comply with the discovery order contained in
the Injunction, which specifically requires it to make certain disclosure in respect of the Account.  Such failure on the part of
the defendant to do so is in my mind an important consideration.  On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that an order in terms
of the Summons as briefly amended should be made.  I so order.","BRIGHT MOON INTERNATIONAL TRADE CO. LIMITED

RANKOTHPEDI DURAYALAGE KAMALAWATHI v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION [2018] HKCFI 1579; HCAL 425/2017 (11 July 2018),"22.  Fourth, both parties are, in the present case, litigating on public funds.  If no stay of proceedings is granted, time and resources
will have to be spent, unnecessarily, by the parties on arguing issues under Ground 2 which will be authoritatively determined by
the Court of Appeal in the Appeal.  Furthermore, proceeding with a hearing of the present application will mean that other litigants
will have to wait longer for their cases to be heard and resolved.  This will undermine the objectives of the CJR, including those
of promoting procedural economy and ensuring the fair distribution of the court’s resources. 23.  For the foregoing reasons, I make an order staying the proceedings herein pending the final determination of the Appeal by the Court
of Appeal.  I further make an order in terms of paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Respondent’s summons dated 20 March 2018.  I do not consider
the conduct of the Applicant to be such as would justify an order of indemnity costs being made against her. 24.  Lastly, it remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance rendered to the court.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1579.html,"

present application was not mentioned.  I accept that the Breach of Trusts Amendments lack particulars.  I also accept Mr Ho’s
submissions on the implications which the proposed Amendments have.  Most importantly, those amendments, if allowed, would raise
new issues of facts which would, if the Deceased were still alive, require new factual issues to be canvassed by him.  That is however
no longer possible.  In my view, quite apart from the lateness of the application, and the distinct possibility of the trial dates
being upset (18 days having been reserved from 9 October 2018), allowing the application will cause prejudice and unfairness to the
defendants, and in particular to the estate of the Deceased and D2, which cannot be put right by costs. 12.  In all the circumstances, and having balanced them, I refuse the application. 13.

so form part of a broader strategy, which the relief if granted will advance, presentation of a petition under section 740 is an impermissible use of the jurisdiction.  The guileless admission of the purpose for presenting the petition in Re Astec[7] perhaps made the issue of principle seem rather simpler to Jonathan Parker J than, with respect, it seems to me to be.  For example,
I ask rhetorically, does it make a difference if Elliott as sophisticated investors anticipate that a desirable consequence of obtaining
the order they seek would probably be the Bank becoming a takeover target, as opposed to Elliott being motivated to some degree in
deciding to issue the Petition by a desire that the Bank becomes a takeover target?  Again asked rhetorically, what if the members
of the board of the relevant members of the Elliott Group, whilst all agreeing to a resolution that the Petition should be presented,
had varying views on why this should be done? 11.  Mr Yu submitted that if I were to find against him I should not deal with the factual and legal arguments advanced before me other
than in general terms as it might unhelpfully influence the way in which the parties prepared their cases if the matter proceeds
to trial.  I agree.  It does not seem to me appropriate to purport to determine any of the issues on a strike-out application, as
in the case of the collateral purpose issue Mr Sussex invited me to do, and I agree with Mr Yu that to produce a detailed reasoned
decision would risk influencing the way in which the parties shaped their cases going forward. 12.

step causing an additional expenditure of HK$242,500 is a material change of circumstances. 55.

There was also a memorandum of notification of an application for legal aid dated 31 May 2018 filed in the succession actions. 31.  It is at present unknown if the plaintiff would be given assistance by the Director of Legal Aid (and if so, if plaintiff counsel
will still be retained thereafter).  If in fact legal assistance is so given, the same expectation as para 29 above will equally
apply. 32.  The parties’ written submissions also mentioned various other points.  These have not been expressly set out or dealt with above.
 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the reasons for decision and its easier comprehension.  It
does not mean those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have
also been considered.","HONG MON (康夢)

AMUSE PEACE LTD v. CHINA CITY CONSTRUCTION (INTERNATIONAL) CO. LTD [2018] HKCFI 1644; HCA 2913/2016 (16 July 2018),"28.  It is not disputed that the Loan was advanced, and was not repaid. The assertion of the Security Agreement is rejected as unbelievable.
There is no defence to the claim made under the Cheque, on the alleged basis of total failure of consideration. The cases relied
upon by Leading Counsel for CCC International are totally distinguishable and are inapplicable to the facts of the present case.
In Tan Khay Chuen v Ko Ping Shun Benson CACV 238/2015, 8 July 2016, the consideration relied upon to support the claim under the cheque issued to the 2nd plaintiff was the guarantee, and there was a genuine triable issue as to whether the guarantee issued by the defendant to the 1st plaintiff had been discharged. In Lomax Leisure Ltd (in liq) v Miller [2007] EWHC 2508 (Ch), the court held, on the peculiar facts of the case, that there was no consideration for the cheques issued for dividends, since there
was no antecedent debt, or liability of the liquidators sued, to be absolved. In our present case, the consideration for the Cheque
is clearly the Loan, and there is no dispute that the Loan was advanced by Amuse, received by CCC International, and remains unpaid. 29.  Whether the evidence of Zhang - that he did not know Zhong nor the wider transactions involving the RMB Loan - is in fact believable,
is not in my view material to the consideration of whether CCC International has shown a bona fide defence, when the nature of the
claims made in the SOC and the disputed issues raised in the Defence are borne in mind. 30.  For all the above reasons, summary judgment should be entered in favor of Amuse, for the outstanding Loan of HK$540 million, interest
thereon at 1.5% per month from 17 June 2016 to the date of judgment, and further interest from the date of judgment, at judgment
rate, until payment, together with the costs of the action (including the costs of and incidental to the application for summary
judgment), to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two Counsel.","羅紫齡

under paragraph 5 of the amended defence and counterclaim.  The supporting affirmation has not really added much to the matter. 46.  Had the plaintiff indicated consent (or no opposition) to the Amendment Summons at the CMC, any dispute over costs could and would
have been dealt with there and then without the need for another hearing.  So analysed, if one gets to the root of the matter, the
view can be legitimately taken that the Hearing was ultimately necessitated by the plaintiff’s failure to consent to the Amendment
Summons at the CMC.  Consequently, the Master did not act unreasonable or err in law in awarding the costs of the Hearing to the
defendants. 47.  For these reasons, I dismiss the Appeal. I also make an order nisi that the plaintiff should pay the defendants’ costs of and occasioned by the Appeal, to be taxed on a party and party basis if

ACROPOLIS LTD v. THE HONGKONG &AMP; SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 1670; HCMP 1031/2018 (16 July 2018),"10.  As far as I can see, the Summons serves no substantive purpose.  The orders applied for thereunder overlap completely with the orders sought under the OS.  The inference that I draw is
that the plaintiff took out the Summons solely to squeeze its application onto the list of the summons judge on the next available
summons day so as to get a quick disposal.  It did so by indorsing the margin of the Summons with a reference to Order 29 rule 1 when none of the orders applied for is within the scope of Order 29.  The citation of Order 29 rule 1 is misleading, and I say, deliberately so. 11.  Such procedural manoeuvre is inexcusable.  There is no urgency in the application.  The availability of the information / documents
sought by the plaintiff is not going to be prejudiced by the normal waiting time for a hearing.  The petition in HCCW 218/2017 has
not yet been set down for trial. 12.  No doubt the plaintiff has anticipated the Banks to adopt a neutral stance and hoped that the court would somehow overlook the procedural
irregularities.  This kind of mentality should be discouraged. That the plaintiff may eventually obtain the information / documents
it desires is neither here nor there.  It is wrong as a matter of principle to allow a party to retain, or benefit from, an advantage
that it has obtained solely through abusing the process of the court, especially where the abuse appears to be intentional.",(Lisa Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1670.html,"

gear covered by regulation 18A.  The argument that a sling used in raising or lowering a load is not regulated by the regulation
because it is made of fibre cannot hold water. 55.  Accordingly, I find all the grounds of appeal fail. 56.  The Magistrate’s interpretation that the fibre slings used in this case fall within the ambit of regulation 18A(a) is plainly
correct.  The conviction is neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory.  The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.",Date of Judgment: 17 July 2018(C P Pang),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1640.html,"

and that P had to come to this Court before obtaining some documents.  I am prepared to reconsider the matter of costs.  Having said
this, I am still of the view that Ds are largely successful in resisting a greater part of the Discovery Summons and I am only prepared
to vary the Order Nisi to the extent that P is to pay 80% of Ds’ costs.  As for the costs of this application, I will similarly
order P to pay Ds’ costs to reflect P’s limited success. 14.  I will ask Ds to submit a further statement of their costs of this application within 7 days, and P to submit list of objections

express/implied condition, the alleged derogation of grant or the alleged blockages.  As for the other aspects of their counterclaim,
they are nothing but bare assertions and the Defendants have once again failed to “condescend into particulars”.  And as far
as the alleged water leakage or contamination is concerned, Chu J in Golden Sunrise Ltd v Lee Kwok Hung at [37] has made it clear that a tenant takes the property subject to any defects existing at the time of the letting, and to any
events that subsequently affect its value.  While there is no application by the Plaintiffs to strike it out, this court does not
find the alleged counterclaim credible or has any sufficient legal basis.  For these reasons, this court is not prepared to grant
leave to defend on the basis of the counterclaim. 37.  To conclude, this is a simple landlord and tenant dispute.  The Defendants have failed to raise any triable issue or provide any
reason why the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant as tenant under the Sub‑Lease or against the 2nd Defendant as guarantor under the Guarantee should go to trial. 38.

BAOSTEEL ENGINEERING &AMP; TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO LTD v. CHINA ZENITH CHEMICAL GROUP LTD [2018] HKCFI 1678; HCCT 7/2018 (18 July 2018),"10.  In my view, BS as the judgment creditor under the Award will be unfairly prejudiced if enforcement of the Award in Hong Kong is
delayed by reason of some claim made by another party, HH, on the Mainland, on the basis that it may result in a Mainland judgment
in the indefinite future, and which may give rise to BS’ liability to pay to HH an amount which exceeds the sum payable by CZ to
BS under the Award.  There is no evidence that BS will not be in a position to pay under any Mainland judgment, if and when such
judgment is issued.  At most, CZ claims that even if HH can recover the PRC Judgment Debt from BS on the Mainland, due to foreign
exchange controls on the Mainland, HH would not be able to reimburse CZ in Hong Kong. 11.  Although CZ is a company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Exchange, BS claims that there are concerns about CZ as a going
concern, and this is evidenced by CZ’s own 2017 Annual Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements, its directors’ views
on the future liquidity and financial position of CZ and its group, and by its qualified 2017-2018 Report and the Consolidated Financial
Statement.  12.  Balancing all the foregoing matters, I was only prepared, with some reluctance, to order a temporary stay of enforcement on the
Award for a period of 6 months from 11 July 2018, conditional upon CZ’s provision of security in Hong Kong, by payment into court
of the full amount of the Award, calculated to be RMB 19,818,046, or the provision of a bank guarantee for such sum.  If security
could not be duly provided within 14 days, the application for stay of execution is discharged.  Liberty was given to both parties
to apply to vary, lift or continue the stay, if the status of the Mainland proceedings is rendered more certain after the end of
July 2018 and if the Mainland proceedings can be seen to progress without prejudice to CZ’s interests in the timely enforcement
of the Award in Hong Kong.  Costs were ordered to be paid by CZ to BS.","CHINA ZENITH CHEMICAL GROUP LIMITED

RE CHINA SOLAR ENERGY HOLDINGS LTD [2018] HKCFI 1932; HCCW 108/2015 (18 July 2018),"5.  It also seems to me that at the outset, both the Company and the investor had their own specific interests which they were entitled
to want to ensure were properly represented at the hearing, even if in practice it might well be that a substantial amount of the
argument dealing with the legal issues discussed in my decision would in the first instance be advanced by counsel for the provisional
liquidators.  As Mr Scott SC correctly reminded me the joint and provisional liquidators’ principal interest was to represent the
economic interests of the creditors in the proposed restructuring that Ankang were trying to derail, the board of the Company’s
interest obviously extended further and to the contributories of the Company generally; the investor had an independent commercial
interest in ensuring that the application was properly contested and its interests adequately protected.  6.  The only matter which it seems to me requires much consideration is Ankang’s suggestion that it was not necessary for the Company
to be represented by two counsel, given the representation that the joint and provisional liquidators appointed.  This, of course,
is a matter of judgment, and a judgment that had to be made at the time it was necessary for the Company to determine what representation
was appropriate for the hearing.  It is not a matter that can be assessed with the benefit of hindsight.  It does seem to me that
the issues that were raised by the summons were sufficiently important and sufficiently complicated that it was not unreasonable
for the Company to take the view that it was appropriate for two counsel to be instructed.  7.  I will, therefore, make orders in the terms of the summonses issued by the Company and the investor for a variation of the costs

the taking of the estate account, the court should order the Defendant to pay to the Plaintiff half of the proceeds of sale of the
5 Properties less the amount already received by the Plaintiff which he is entitled to as a beneficiary of the residuary estate of
Mr Au.  In this regard, I have been told by Mr Chain that Madam Lai’s statutory legacy of HK$500,000 has already been satisfied
from the cash available in the estate of Mr Au. 23.  On the footing that the Plaintiff and Madam Lai (or her estate) are the only two beneficiaries of the residuary estate of Mr Au
in equal shares, the Plaintiff should prima facie be entitled to 50% of the sale proceeds of Properties A, B and C, ie HK$1,687,500.  In relation to Properties D and E, taking into
account the fact that (i) the Plaintiff has already received a portion of the proceeds of sale of those properties, (ii) Mr Lai Ping
Kai also has an interest in the sale proceeds, and (iii) there is, I understand, an outstanding issue as to the nature of the sum
of HK$1,000,000 referred to as “Security money for Fire Directions” deducted out of the sale proceeds, I do not consider it appropriate

"BANCO DE CHILE v. BORUIDA TRADING CO., LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1780; HCA 1621/2018 (20 July 2018)","5.  The evidence discloses a good arguable case by the plaintiff against the defendants.  A serious risk of dissipation can clearly
be inferred from the facts.  Balance of convenience favours the continuation of the Injunction Order. 6.  In so far as the application for production of documents againstthe banks is concerned, I have considered the evidence filed before
this Court.  I record that the summons and all documents in support have been served not only on the defendants but on the banks
concerned.  I have considered the submissions made by Mr Yu for the plaintiff.  I have considered the authorities cited in support.
 I have previously, echoing the warning made in previous authorities, observed that the powers which the Court is now being invited
to invoke have to be exercised with great caution.  It is important to maintain banker/customer confidence.  I have on the other
hand in Akbank TAS v Mainford Limited & Ors [2018] HKCFI 363 (unreported, HCA 3264/2016, 22 February 2018) observed that Hong Kong being an international city, the law should
be facilitative but not obstructive when a victim of a cybercrime comes to our courts for lawful redresses against the true culprits.
 It is a balancing exercise which the Court has to undertake. 7.  In the present case, I note that there is a strong prima facie case of cyber fraud.  The scale and nature of the same as alleged are both large and sophisticated.  The defendants were first level
direct recipients of the Funds.  The claims against them are therefore both personal and proprietary in nature.  The documents and
information sought are clearly relevant.  They are specifically defined, both in terms of nature and duration.  They are confined
to D1’s HSB A/C, D2’s SCB A/C and D3’s BOC A/C.  In respect of the use of any documents that may be disclosed, the draft order
expressly specifies that they may not be used against the disclosing banks, thereby avoiding any possible concern and argument over
infringing any party’s privilege against self-incrimination.  The three Banks are neutral to the application.  On the facts of
this case, I am satisfied that an order in terms of the Summons should be made.  I so order.","MINERVA HOLDING LIMITED

MORAL LUCK FINANCE LTD v. CHEUNG KWAI YIN [2018] HKCFI 1795; HCMP 1306/2017 (20 July 2018),"8.  On 13 July 2018, with her 2nd affirmation of 10 July 2018 in support, the applicant applied for and obtained before Wong J what is in effect a re-grant of the
23/6/17 Mareva Injunction (the “13-7-18 Mareva Injunction”). The ceiling of the restrained amount was, in accordance with the amount of the costs allowed, adjusted to HK$2,967,105.60. 
I note that on 7 June 2018, the applicant applied for Legal Aid.  That accounts for the slight delay in the making of the application
before Wong J. 9.  I have read the 2nd affirmation of the applicant.  I have read the authorities cited to me, which include Menno Leendert Vos v Global Fair Industrial Ltd & others HCA 4200/1995(unreported, 25 March 2010).  I have heard counsel for the applicant.  I note that this is in effect an application
for a post-judgment Mareva injunction.  The existence of a good arguable case is not in doubt.  Given the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the plaintiff
as outlined above, including the failure on the part of the plaintiff to make disclosure in aid as ordered by the 23/6/17 Mareva
Injunction, and in the absence of any evidence in opposition from the plaintiff, a serious risk of dissipation can in my view be
inferred.  The balance of convenience is also in favour of the continuation of the 13-7-18 Mareva Injunction.  However, whilst I
am prepared to continue the 13‑7‑18 Mareva Injunction pending initiation of execution process, I am not prepared to order it
to be continued indefinitely.  In my view, it is not appropriate to do so—see Republic of Haiti v Duvalier [1990] 1 QB 202, per Staughton LJ at 214G–H.  While the applicant will need some protection in terms of the 13-7-18 Mareva Injunction at this stage,
she should avail herself of the usual execution mechanism in due course.  I will proceed to hear Mr Ma on the duration. 10.  The Injunction granted by Wong J on 17 July 2018 be continued until 16 July 2019 unless before then it is varied or discharged by

RE CHINA TAIFENG BEDDINGS HOLDINGS LTD [2018] HKCFI 1755; HCCW 199/2018 (24 July 2018),"7.  The most straightforward way for the Company to deal with this technical issue is to find a friendly creditor to present a winding-up
petition, the board could then resolve to apply to appoint provisional liquidators.  I do not think that that application would run
into the Emmadart problem.  8.  I am satisfied that, subject to the issue that I have discussed, this is a proper case to appoint provisional liquidators.  It also
seems to me that as the board of the Company is presently involved in a restructuring exercise it is probable that any order appointing
provisional liquidators could at its inception legitimately include restructuring powers. Generally, the present practice of the
Company’s Court is that orders appointing provisional liquidators do not initially contain restructuring powers; those are only
introduced after the provisional liquidators have familiarised themselves with the affairs of the Company and if they make an application
to extend their powers. 9.  I will, therefore, adjourn the application.  It may be that any further application has to be heard by another judge.",Date of Decision: 24 July 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1755.html,"

sale.  Counsel has mentioned the difficulty in respect of compliance with the government policy for a land of this nature, under

required amongst the people interested in the land as well as the attitude of the government, save and except that the Director of

RE ENICE HOLDING CO LTD [2018] HKCFI 1736; HCMP 2705/2017 (26 July 2018),"47.  I would end with making some observations about the listing of proceedings such as the present.  Practice Direction 3.1, Part II,
[5.5] provides that an originating summons to convene a meeting to consider a scheme pursuant to section 673 of the Companies Ordinance, Cap 622, shall be listed on Tuesdays at 10am and the bundles and skeleton shall be filed the preceding Tuesday.  The conventional
practice has been for a solicitor, who has been instructed to proceed with a scheme promptly to contact the Companies Judge’s clerk
to fix dates.  The court will normally try and accommodate a proposed timetable if given sufficient notice and it is common for hearings
to be heard on days other than a Tuesday.  The solicitors should then work to the dates that have been allocated.  48.  I have noticed in recent years an increasing tendency for solicitors not to proceed as I have described, but to leave fixing dates
to well after formulation and drafting of a scheme has commenced and then expect the court to accommodate what is described as an
“urgent’ application.  In the more extreme cases not only are dates sought within a few weeks of the court being approached,
but solicitors request that the dates are fixed in accordance with their counsel’s diary and in apparent ignorance of PD3.1.  The
present case was an example.  When the court informed Dentons that their preferred dates were simply not available, the court received
complaints that if the hearing to convene the meeting did not take place promptly this would be inconsistent with the Australian
practice and expectation; a complaint that looked increasingly lame as the matter proceeded and the Company required substantial
time to address various questions the court had about the structure of the scheme that it became apparent neither Dentons nor the
Company’s legal advisers in Australia had identified nor readily answer. 49.  I would emphasise that the Companies Court expects solicitors to proceed as follows when acting for parties introducing schemes
or capital reductions.  As soon as they are instructed to proceed with a scheme or capital reduction they should approach the Companies
Judge’s clerk to obtain dates, which it is reasonable to expect the company to meet.  Counsel should be instructed who are available
on the allocated dates and the Company should work towards those dates.  The Companies Court should not be expected to fit in with
the convenience of companies and solicitors should make this clear to those instructing them.",IN THE MATTER of the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622)(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1736.html,"

took at paragraphs 38 and 39 of his written submissions, that: 42.  The Court is requested to rule on the application before it.  It is an application for specific performance.  It is not an application
for any declaratory relief on the meaning of any terms of the Settlement Agreement (if one can be made).  It was not prepared and
presented as such.  The Court is cautious that it should not be, and should not be perceived to be, rewriting the Settlement Agreement
for want of clarity.  In the circumstances, I form the view that I should merely dismiss the application for the reasons explained
above.  43.  I consider that this is an appropriate case to adopt the approach of costs to follow the event.  I made an order nisi that the costs of and incidental to this application, including that of the adjourned hearing of 18 January 2018, should be paid
by D1 to P1 and P2, to be taxed if not agreed.","CHEUNG SIU LING

the Joint Account. She could have kept the remaining monies of $7,244,594.19 (ie $17,244,594.19 (Sole Account Monies) - $10,000,000.00
(Per Capita Shares for the Siblings)) in the Sole Account and asked the Son to “manage” the same as before. The fact the Mother
took the step to close the Sole Account and open the Joint Account clearly indicated a different intention and a change from the
previous arrangement. Alternatively, the Mother could have transferred the entire sum of $7,244,594.19 to the Son for him to “manage”
the same on her behalf without the trouble of opening the Joint Account in the name of Vicky and the Son. Alternatively, the Mother
could have placed such sum in the Joint Account and let the Son and Vicky to manage such monies on her behalf. In my view and as
Mr Wong submitted, the deliberate split of the sum of $7,244,594.19 into 2 parts (ie the Son Transfer and the Sole Account Balance)
with different treatment strongly suggested they were for different purposes and plainly supported my conclusion there was no trust
in respect of the Son Transfer. 239.  By reason of the above findings and conclusions, it is unnecessary for me to consider the interesting arguments raised by Mr Yau

HUI KIT KEUNG AND ANOTHER v. HSUI KWOK KEUNG AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1782; HCA 808/2015 (31 July 2018),"17.  Fifth, Mr Yip stated at the hearing that the Plaintiffs’ application was based only on sub-paragraph (g) of Section 45 of the Trustee Ordinance, which states as follows - 18.  Mr Yip further stated, in answer to the court’s query, that in the application of Section 45(g) to the present case, the “trustee” referred to therein would be the Plaintiffs.  However, it seems clear that Section 45(g) envisages the situation where land or any interest therein is vested in a trustee and an order is sought to vest such land or interest
in a third person (other than the trustee).  In the present case, the Plaintiffs, as executors and trustees of the Will, are vested
with the 1/12 share in the Property formerly held in the name of the Deceased, but it is not the Plaintiffs’ application that such
1/12 share in the Property should be vested in any other party.  It may be argued that the respective shares in the Property held
in the names of the Defendants and Madam Hui are held by them as “trustee” and an order ought to be made to vest those shares
in the Plaintiffs in their capacity as executors and trustees of the Will in view of the agreement of the Defendants and Madam Hui
that the Property forms part of the estate of the Deceased.  However, I do not see why it would be “expedient” for the court
to make a vesting order when, as earlier mentioned, the same result can be achieved by the parties themselves without any court order. 19.  For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Summons dated 17 July 2018 is dismissed.  The Plaintiffs and the Defendants are agreed

extensive bar which comprises bilingual and monolingual counsel, creates an issue peculiar to Hong Kong.  36.  There will be often occasions when the appropriate counsel to instruct is monolingual in English.  Where the lay client’s mother
tongue is Chinese it is, in my view, entirely appropriate to instruct, in addition to counsel monolingual in English, a bilingual
junior who will be able to assist, in Chinese, in the explanation of documents and advice to the client. 37.  For that reason, I was satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case there should be a certificate for two counsel.","CHEUNG HAY LEE HAILEY (張熙梨)

On the other hand, as has been explained at paragraph 15/16/2 of Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018, Volume 1: 18.  I have considered the contents of the Statement of Claim.  The pleaded facts clearly support the plaintiff’s case that it is the
victim of an elaborate email fraud, and that it has suffered loss in the amount of the Sum.  It appears entitled to relief based
on its proprietary interest in the Sum.  I bear in mind the fact that declaratory relief is being sought.  I need to bear in mind
the rules of practice set out above and decide how I should exercise my discretion.  I take into account the fact that fraud is pleaded
and deemed established.  I take further into account the fact that nothing is known about the defendant, including whether it has
any other creditors.  The plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaratory relief sought, so as to avert any need for it to race
against other creditors.  Fairness justifies it.  I note further that BOC is neutral to the application.  In all the circumstances,
I am satisfied that the facts of the present case are such that I should exercise my discretion in favour of granting the declaratory
relief and the vesting order sought. 19.  For the above reasons, I order that judgment in terms of the Summons be entered against the defendant, together with costs of the
action and this application.  I grant further the Order as per the Summons and the draft order that has been placed before me.  In

a result of which Order 59 r 4(1)(a) and (b) seems to be infelicitously worded as far as appeals in winding-up matters are concerned.
 Mr Ho suggested that their true construction is that, as far as companies winding-up is concerned, r 4(1)(b) only applies to final judgments or orders in winding up matters, where leave to appeal is not required, whereas r 4(1)(a) applies to interlocutory judgments or orders in winding up proceedings. It is, however, unnecessary for me to express any view on this. 22.  For the above reasons, I conclude that the Decision falls within s 98(2) and that no leave to appeal is required.  The Applicants’
summons will therefore be dismissed.  It is unnecessary for me to express any view on the prospects of success of the intended appeal.

for injunctive relief was in fact made in the earlier action, but was dismissed as it was not supported by any substantive cause
of action.  Had a request been sent in the context of a properly constituted case, the response might have been different. 13.  Ds’ approach in the conduct of the Summons has been reasonable.  They indicated their preparedness to consent to the Summons at
a relatively early stage on 6 July 2018.  At a later stage, they even offeredto bear the costs of the Summons (to the exclusion of
any costs on preparation of the evidence).  It is also relevant to note that under Order 1A, rule 1(e), one of the underlying objectives of the Rules of the High Court is “to facilitate the settlement of disputes”. 14.  In all the circumstances, I am of the view that the fair and just costs order in the circumstances of the present case should be
that the costs of and occasioned by the Summons, including this hearing, be in the cause.  I have considered whether, given the offer
that Ds have made, the costs for this hearing should be subject to a different order.  I have considered on the other hand that this
is a dispute between family members.  Such disputes, experience tells, are unfortunately on most occasions pursued even more vehemently
than as between strangers.  I factor this consideration in.  I also repeat the underlying objective under Order 1A, rule 1(e). In all, I remain of the view that the order I indicated earlier is the fair and just one to make.  I so order.","PRIMLAKS (H.K.) LIMITED

On behalf of the Receiver Ms Lam relied on certain passages in Palmer’s Company Law, paras 15.696 and 15.696.1 to suggest that a liquidator is deprived of his right of relief against the assets of the company only
if his conduct is in some way blameworthy.  I have to say it is not clear to me that those passages are intended to refer to the
expenses of litigation between the liquidator and the company itself.  In fact, in Re The Grande Holdings Ltd [2018] HKCFI 507, referred to at §37 of my decision dated 8 June 2018, I have ascertained from the court file of that case that
Harris J actually made an order that the provisional liquidators “shall personally pay” the investor’s and the company’s
costs of the appeal from the Master to be taxed if not agreed. 11.  It seems to me there is no usual rule in the present kind of case that the receiver should be indemnified as to all costs. Nor is
there a general rule that a fiduciary can litigate unsuccessfully against the beneficiary at the latter’s expense.  Contrary to
my initial impression, the point of principle is not entirely novel, having regard to the authorities referred to in my decision.
 In all the circumstances of this case I fail to see why costs should not follow the event.  Taking into account, however, that none
of the authorities relied upon in paras 28 to 33 and 35 to 38 of my decision nor Order 30 r 5 was cited by counsel or drawn to the
attention of the Receiver earlier by the Association, and the lateness of the Association’s application due to its own internal
problems, I consider that the Association should only have half of its costs.  12.  There will accordingly be an order that the Receiver do pay half of the Association’s costs of the application including the costs
of the argument on costs (without indemnity from the Association’s assets), with a certificate for junior counsel, to be taxed

it is still open to her, and whether she still wishes, to pursue that aspect of the reliefs.  I therefore direct that if R still

plaintiff would be able to obtain the return of the properties without an order of the court.  And it is also understandable that
two respondents would need the protection of a court order if they are to release the trust property to the plaintiff.  The two respondent
banks have been served with these proceedings.  Both of them have indicated in writing their neutral stance in respect of the plaintiff’s

dismissed, whether for want of prosecution or otherwise.  In any event, P has raised credible triable issues and the matter should
go to trial.  I therefore dismiss D1’s 4 summonses. 46.  At the hearing, Mr Wong has undertaken to issue a case management summons within 14 days of the handing down of this decision, unless
the action is dismissed.  This undertaking should be incorporated in the order.  I further note that no affidavits of testamentary
scripts have been filed under Order 76 rule 5(1).  The filing of the affidavits of scripts should precede the service of pleadings.  As set out paragraph 76/5/1 of HKCP, and observed by Lam J, as he then was in Lam Ping v Zi Yan Lu (unrep March 21, 2010), this rule is frequently ignored.  There is a general power for the master to extend time for compliance with

make an application for extension of time to comply with Order 76 rule 5 (1). 47.  Lastly, as I have dismissed D1’s 4 summonses, costs should follow the event.  I therefore order D1 to pay P’s costs of and incidental
to the 4 summonses.  Such costs should be summarily assessed and paid by D1 within 14 days of assessment.  P is to lodge statement

CHINA REAL ESTATES INVESTMENT HOLDINGS LTD v. GOLD BLESS INTERNATIONAL INVEST LTD [2018] HKCFI 1868; HCCT 46/2017 (8 August 2018),"9.  Essentially, what Mr Yu is saying is: I want to find out if there was any possible wrongdoing by the director of the Respondent
which can be raised to constitute an arguable defence to the claims made by the Applicant under the agreement which is the subject
matter of the arbitration leading to the Award, which is now being enforced.  That is clearly impermissible fishing, and cannot be
the basis of a discovery order.  To borrow the phrase used in Lady Anne Tennant v Associated Newspapers Group Ltd which was in the context of O 14 proceedings, Mr Yu is only seeking to investigate alleged obscurities in the hope that something
will turn up on the investigation, and his case at this stage remains in the realm of mere surmise. 10.  Further, Mr Yu already obtained from the BVI court, the forum where the Respondent is incorporated, an order for documents to be
provided by Mr Yang, which covers the same scope of the documents sought in these proceedings.  Mr Yang has made disclosure of some
of the documents and has filed an affirmation to state that he is not in possession of any other documents.  As Mr Yang rightly pointed
out, if Mr Yu contends (and can establish) that there are further documents in existence and in Mr Yang’s possession, he can take
further action in the BVI court to compel discovery or for contempt. Bearing in mind the underlying objectives of the CJR, I am not
satisfied that an order for discovery of the type now sought is either necessary in these proceedings for disposing fairly of the
cause or matter, or for saving costs, or is in any way proportionate, or procedurally economical. 11.  I agree that the wide and unwarranted scope of the discovery sought, on suspicion and speculation, lacking in particulars of the
fraud, collusion and breach of fiduciary duties alleged, shows that the application made is an unwarranted fishing expedition and
an abuse of process, which is dismissed with costs, to be paid by Mr Yu.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1868.html,"

he should return to Singapore as soon as practicable. 122.  In light of all the above said, on the Father’s undertaking that he will accompany the Child to return to Singapore and on the
Father’s undertaking that he will give the Mother generous access, I order the Child to be returned to Singapore within 7 days

Director of Social Welfare to assist if necessary. There will be liberty to apply in relation to the implementation of this order. 123.

In any event, bearing in mind that (as held in Kamy Town) the burden is on Jin and the Applicant (acting through Jin) in this case to establish that these proceedings were commenced with
the authority of the Applicant, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Jin, simply as being the registered Legal Representative,
was authorized by the Applicant to commence these proceedings and to make the Subject Application.  I am not persuaded that the distinction
sought to be made by Mr Wong, as to the validity of Jin’s registered status vis-à-vis the public including LS, serves any real
purpose on the facts of this case.  As the Mainland court decided in Case No 20 of 2014, the resolutions of the shareholders and
directors of the Applicant will bind Jin as shareholder, and Q’s status as the newly appointed Legal Representative is valid vis-à-vis
the former director and shareholders of the Applicant including Jin.  It is precisely Q, W and H who are disputing Jin’s authority
as the Applicant’s Legal Representative in this case, as evidenced by (inter alia) W’s affirmation reflecting the stated position
of the board of directors of the Applicant.  I also fail to see how the act and decision of the registered legal representative of
a company can override the decision of the board of directors of the company as to whether legal proceedings should be continued. 31.  For all the above reasons, I set aside the Leave Order, the Judgment and the garnishee order to show cause.  Once the Leave Order
is to set aside for material non-disclosure, the consequence is that the Judgment and the garnishee order cannot stand and should
be set aside.  Setting aside these orders are the appropriate and inevitable remedy, upon deciding that the action was not authorized
and should be brought to an end.  32.  The costs of and incidental to the 2/18 Summons are to be paid to the Respondent by Jin, who purported to act on behalf of the Applicant.
 LS were informed by the 2/2 Letter as to Jin’s lack of authority and the resolutions of 23 August 2017 and 4 September 2017.

梁頌恆 v. 立法會主席 [2018] HKCFI 1869; [2018] 5 HKC 138; HCAL 1160/2018 (14 August 2018),"22.  There is one other problem in Mr Leung’s application in HCAL 1160/2018 for interim relief that I should mention. The Legco President
is named as the respondent to the application, and the relief sought is an order for a “stay of execution” of the Bill.  I am
given to understand that, by seeking a “stay of execution” (暫緩執行) of the Bill, Mr Leung is asking the court to grant
an order to restrain the coming into force of the Ordinance.  That being the application, it seems obvious that the proper respondent
to the application should be the Secretary for Transport and Housing, who is empowered by Section 1(2) of the Ordinance to appoint
a day for the coming into operation of that Ordinance by notice, or the Government of the HKSAR.  In this regard, it should be recognised
that the Secretary for Transport and Housing is not a subordinate of the Legco President, and does not act under his order or direction.
 Once the Bill has been passed by the Legco, the Legco President has no further role to play in relation to the coming into force
of the Ordinance.  In my view, it is clear the application for interim relief should not have been made against the Legco President.
 I should mention, to be fair to Mr Leung, that he made it clear, at the hearing as well as in a previous letter dated 2 August 2018,
that he was not seeking any order against the Legco President personally by the present application, although he maintained that
the Legco President was responsible for the passing of the Bill in the Legco. 23.  In all, I have reached the clear conclusion that the applications for interim relief should be refused. 24.

I also agree with Mr Tang that by the time of second decision, the learned judge was functus in relation to his first decision and as the Court of Appeal had noted the only avenue open to the applicant was through judicial
review.  Further, it is my view that the forfeiture of the entire bail money is not disproportionate as at the time when the first
decision was made.  It was clear that the applicant had voluntarily absented himself, not only from court but from Hong Kong. 29.  At the end of the day, I cannot say therefore that the learned judge was in error in forfeiting the bail money. I have therefore
no hesitation in dismissing this application to quash the first and second decisions of the learned judge and to dismiss the application

LCYP v. JEK [2018] HKCFI 1907; HCMC 3/2018 (16 August 2018),"153.  Having considered the above, I agree with the Wife, the Husband has so far failed to comply with his obligation to make a full,
frank and clear disclosure of his financial position.  His disclosures have been piecemeal and he provided information only when
asked.  His lack of clear disclosure as to his financial position, in particular the source of the payments for his legal costs in
the past of HK$23.5m and the source for payment of his future estimated costs of another HK$5m has led this Court to draw an inference
against him that he has undisclosed financial resources of at least some $20m in the past.      154.  In the above circumstances, I have come to the view that the Husband has the ability to pay the amount of HK$3.5m.  I thus order
the Husband to pay a sum of HK$3.5m to the Wife’s solicitors to be applied towards the Wife’s legal costs up to conclusion of
trial, payable by monthly instalments of HK$500,000 each, to be added to the Wife’s MPS over a period of 7 months commencing from
September 2018 until March 2018.  Any amounts paid by the Husband towards provision of the Wife’s legal costs shall be taken into

TSE FUNG CHIU v. KWOK CHEUNG HING AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1978; HCMP 3419/2016 (16 August 2018),"2.  The applicant in these circumstances predictably seeks his costs.  The underlying issue appears to be this:  There is no dispute
that the Company was required to convene an annual general meeting and lay before the Company audited financial statements for the
periods in respect of which orders were sought.  The sole director of the Company, who is the 1st respondent in both sets of proceedings and was a relatively newly appointed director, faced difficulties in providing the auditors
with all the financial documentation they required in order to complete the audit, in particular in relation to certain director’s
loans.  It seems to me that in the circumstances that the director faced, it was inevitable if the problems were going to be resolved
in accordance with the mechanisms contained in the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622) for the Company at some point to make an application to the court to extend the time for convening the annual general meeting
and laying audited financial statements before the Company at it.  It seems to me, in these circumstances, that the most equitable
way of dealing with costs is simply to provide that the costs of both the applicant and the 1st respondent are paid out of the assets of the 2nd respondent.  3.  Whilst one may, if one descends into the facts, be able to find matters which each party might suggest indicate that the other party
has some responsibilities for the practical problems that led to the delay in the annual general meeting being convened, it seems

TSE FUNG CHIU v. KWOK CHEUNG HING AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 1978; HCMP 3419/2016 (16 August 2018),"2.  The applicant in these circumstances predictably seeks his costs.  The underlying issue appears to be this:  There is no dispute
that the Company was required to convene an annual general meeting and lay before the Company audited financial statements for the
periods in respect of which orders were sought.  The sole director of the Company, who is the 1st respondent in both sets of proceedings and was a relatively newly appointed director, faced difficulties in providing the auditors
with all the financial documentation they required in order to complete the audit, in particular in relation to certain director’s
loans.  It seems to me that in the circumstances that the director faced, it was inevitable if the problems were going to be resolved
in accordance with the mechanisms contained in the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622) for the Company at some point to make an application to the court to extend the time for convening the annual general meeting
and laying audited financial statements before the Company at it.  It seems to me, in these circumstances, that the most equitable
way of dealing with costs is simply to provide that the costs of both the applicant and the 1st respondent are paid out of the assets of the 2nd respondent.  3.  Whilst one may, if one descends into the facts, be able to find matters which each party might suggest indicate that the other party
has some responsibilities for the practical problems that led to the delay in the annual general meeting being convened, it seems
to me that essentially all these relate to the affairs of the Company, which would appear not to have been conducted in accordance
with the statutory scheme or terribly efficiently, and that in these circumstances it is appropriate that the Company bears the costs
that both parties incurred in respect of both originating summonses. 4.

Second, I also do not accept that delay itself is a sufficient ground to deny Zhongtai’s application for summary judgment.[8]  It is certainly unsatisfactory for Zhongtai to make the summary judgment application nearly 16 months after the filing of the Defence
by China Kingstone, but this would not be a sufficient reason to deny summary judgment if the application has merit. Unfortunately,
there is none in the present case. 48.  For the above reasons, I dismiss Zhongtai’s application for summary judgment.  As China Kingstone has an arguable defence to Zhongtai’s
claim, there is no basis for the court to order China Kingstone to make any interim payment to Zhongtai before trial.  I therefore
dismiss the application for interim payment as well.   49.  I also make a costs order nisi that Zhongtai do pay to China Kingstone the costs of the applications, which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the

As Arden LJ (as she then was) in Buhr v Barclays Bank [2001] EWCA Civ 1223;  [2002] BPIR 25 observes in [50] of her judgment: 13.  It, therefore, follows that even if my construction of the charge is incorrect, as a matter of common law, the proceeds of the sale
would be treated as subject to the charge created over the underlying asset.  This being the case, it follows that the payment on
7 January 2016 was out of charged assets and, therefore, did not constitute a disposition of the property of the Company.  The application

RE LEUNG LAI CHING MARGARET [2018] HKCFI 1910; HCB 771/2018 (23 August 2018),"15.  This cannot be what the statutory framework permits as a valid ground for not making the bankruptcy order in relation to a debt
which is payable immediately. 16.  Whilst a bankruptcy order, by operation of law, has its consequence on the transactions of the debtor, and thus the agreements she
has entered into with the Mainland third party, it is not apparent from the terms of those agreements that this per se must frustrate
the deal from the point of view of the debtor’s Mainland counterpart.  If the transaction is proved to be genuine and has the potential
as projected by the debtor, I am sure the trustee in bankruptcy will engage in the necessary investigation and take the necessary
step to ensure that this could benefit the creditors and the estate of the debtor in her bankruptcy. 17.  I therefore found it right to make the usual bankruptcy order with costs, including costs reserved, to be taxed if not agreed. 
For the avoidance of doubt, I put on record the undertaking of the petitioner to give up such security that he still holds in the
form of shares in a number of the debtor’s companies subject to the charging order obtained by the petitioner in 2016 and not covered

None of these concerns the present situation where the court is making known its own decision in respect of applications made and fully heard before the relevant winding-up proceedings even came into existence. 134.

in his valuation of the variation as “fair and reasonable”, to be at least open to serious doubt. 51.  I grant leave to the Plaintiffs to appeal on the questions identified as questions 2 and 4.  Since the matter will proceed to the
2nd stage of determination on the merits of the appeal, I have refrained from making further comments on the substance of the appeal,

MEMORIAL PARK HONG KONG LTD v. SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE [2018] HKCFI 2004; HCMP 2609/2010 (30 August 2018),"72.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. Mr Chan SC submits (and I agree) that in view of Regal Shining (CFI) handed down in October 2014 and Regal Shining (CA) handed down in November 2015, there is no reason for P to persist in its construction of GC 15. This is particularly so when the
plaintiff in Splendid Resources Inc v Secretary for Justice (which was handed down on 10 March 2017)[24] wisely conceded that the placing or storing of human ashes in jars or containers on the land in question (sold by public auction
in 1932 which was earlier than the sale of the Subject Lots by public auction in 1941 and 1949) contravened GC 15.[25] 73.  Mr Chan SC argues there is simply no basis for P to persist on its interpretation and construction of GC15 in face of Regal Shining (CFI), Regal Shining (CA) and Splendid Resources Inc, and to only make concession that Regal Shining (CA) is binding on this court at trial, especially when P has been legally represented all along. It is said that such stance in face
of binding legal authority is contrary to the underlying objectives of reasonable proportionality in the conduct of court proceedings.
In my view, there is force in such argument, and certainly the efforts by D and her legal team in preparing her defence on such issue
(including preparing written skeleton submissions for trial) have been wasted. 74.  I therefore grant a costs order nisi as follows:","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

CARGO CHANNEL SERVICES LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. HANJIN SHIPPING CO LTD [2018] HKCFI 1879; HCA 1919/2016 (31 August 2018),"31.  I decline to accept the submissions of Ms. Gwilt.  As a matter of procedure, it appears that parties did not have the 2-stages test
clearly in mind in pursing and defending the application.  However, for the present purpose, it does not make much difference.  In
my view, parties were still in the first stage as appearing before me as there was no direction or order from the court that the
plaintiff had satisfied its burden at the 1st stage. In the present hearing, the plaintiff has failed to do so.  Alternatively, if it happened that parties had already entered
into the second stage, BCC also showed cause to my satisfaction that the wasted costs order should not be made in the circumstances.
 Apart from the finding of facts as in paragraph 28 above, I specifically decline to accept the submission that I could draw a bad
inference upon BCC from the conduct of Ms. Chark when she argued that she could sign the statement of truth for her client. Although
I did reject her argument and/or interpretation of O.41A r.3 RHC, it does not necessarily mean that she took it to delay the proceedings.
Without more, a simple rejection or non-acceptance of a legal argument put forward by a legal representative shall not be taken as
that he or she is advancing such argument with bad intention.          32.  As to costs, I do not have the benefit of the parties of their argument.  However, it appears to me that no order as to costs appear
to be the appropriate one in the circumstances.  The suspicion on the part of the plaintiff’s solicitors turns out to be true.
It has triggered the investigation on the part of BCC. The trustee did rectify, if necessary, the action of BCC. Without it, the
question whether BCC did act, at some point in time, with or without authority could become more complicated.    33.  To conclude, the summons is dismissed with an order nisi of no order as to costs.","Hanjin Shipping Company Limited

HAI KUO SHIPPING 1201 LTD v. EVERWIN SHIPPING (HONG KONG) CO LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1906; HCAJ 79/2014 (31 August 2018),"7.  The trial of this action took place on 11 July 2018.  A Notice of Trial was issued to the parties on 24 August 2017.  However, neither
the 2nd Defendant nor the 3rd Defendant appeared at the trial.  One Mr Zhu appeared in court and said that he was a director of and represented the 1st Defendant.  No leave from the court had been obtained by the 1st Defendant to be represented by a director.  Therefore, there was no proper representation of the 1st Defendant. 8.  The trial proceeded with the Plaintiff calling its evidence to prove its case.  The Plaintiff’s case was straightforward and based
on contractual documents.  Given the absence of the Defendants, no defence or counterclaim was made out.  The court was satisfied
that the Plaintiff had proved its case against each of the Defendants.  9.  Clarifications were sought with the Plaintiff’s counsel on the details of the calculations of its loss and on its interest and
costs entitlements.  In particular, the Agreement did not unequivocally provide for an obligation on the part of the 2nd Defendant for default interest from 25 April 2014, nor did it clearly provide for the 2nd Defendant’s obligation to indemnify the Plaintiff’s costs[2].

"RE SNG ALLAN, ALSO KNOWN AS SNG HOCK SENG [2018] HKCFI 2016; HCB 3651/2018 (31 August 2018)","5.  The petitioner had indeed put a nil value on the shares in the petition pursuant to s 6B(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 6).  The respondent did not argue that such estimates were a sham or that the statutory demand (which also estimated a nil value)
failed to comply with rule 44(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules, despite the fact that Cheng Hung Kit v Tsoi Chik Sang Lawrence [2018] HKCA 396, a recent decision concerning that rule, had been mentioned by Mr Oh on behalf of the petitioner to be distinguished.
 In any event it is well established that the petitioner is bound by the estimated value of the security put in a petition, and cannot
take any benefit in the administration of the bankruptcy except on the basis of that estimate. 6.  Mr Yim asserted that if the shares had been realised earlier at the time of the default, the proceeds of sale would have been sufficient
to meet the outstanding indebtedness. There was no evidence to support this, or even any numbers obtained from publicly available
sources. But this was in any event quite immaterial, as there was no arguable case that the petitioner breached any duty in not selling
the shares at that time.  So far as the statutory demand was concerned, rule 44(5) required the demand to state the value of the security as at the date of the demand.  As at that date (namely, 15 March 2018), the
shares had of course long been suspended from trading.  7.  For these reasons, I did not see any point in having expert evidence as submitted by the respondent.  The usual bankruptcy order
was accordingly made.","Ex-Parte:

SAT KAI CHUEN v. LAW CHI KUN AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2158; HCA 1827/2018 (31 August 2018),"9.  The basis for that is because the plaintiff’s case that a document recording the results of the election of the 2016 balloting
committee contained a signature of his which is forged.  The plaintiff does not seek to challenge the result of that election.  In
fact, he has signed that result record sheet as a member of the 2016 balloting committee but there was another space for him to sign
as the supervising member of that committee.  His allegation is that that signature is a forged one.  10.  Since he has signed as a member although not also as a supervising member, he must have been satisfied with the record of the result
as being accurate.  In any event, if the result of the election of the 2016 balloting committee is correct, then despite the record
of such result being tainted by a forged signature, which is contested, that tainted signature would not have tainted the actual
election result.  Therefore, I do not see any basis for saying that since the record of result has a tainted signature, therefore
the election result would become invalid ab initio.  It does not follow.  I therefore find that there is no serious question to be argued for relief No. 5.  11.  Since there is no serious question to be argued for relief No. 5, there is no basis to grant any interim relief to perpetrate that

she seeks.  It is confined to those Pledged Shares which remain in the custody, power and control of Keyway Seychelles/HK.  I have
considered this refined version of the interim interim injunction.  I repeat my preliminary view expressed above that a compelling
case has been shown that the Pledged Shares require immediate protection. Given the two matters set out in paragraph 20 above, the
balance of convenience is strongly in favour of the plaintiff.  My concern expressed in paragraph 21 above has been addressed.  In
the circumstances, I am convinced that the withholding of the interim interim mandatory injunction sought would in fact carry a greater
risk of injustice than granting it.  I am further satisfied that the balance of fairness, even having factored in the fact that it

RE SHANGHAI HUAXIN GROUP (HONG KONG) LTD [2018] HKCFI 2082; HCCW 126/2018 (3 September 2018),"6.  I will order that the costs of the petitioner, and the Official Receiver, and insofar as the provisional liquidators have been represented

A v. ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS BOARD [2018] HKCFI 2029; HCAL 221/2017 (4 September 2018),"63.  It is highly significant, that the AAB reasoned its decision on the basis that the disclosure by the Person Bound of the applicant’s
personal data to her parents was within the scope of the original purpose to which the applicant agreed it could be used and therefore
did not contravene DPP 3.  This in my view was a valid and proper decision for the AAB to make in the circumstances of the case and
it was open for it to do so.  In essence, this is the crucial feature of the AAB’s decision and after a thorough analysis of the
evidence and arguments it came to this conclusion, and it cannot be said that it was unreasonable or irrational. 64.  I am satisfied after an extensive review of the case and the reasoned decision of the AAB, that the matters the applicant complains
about have been properly considered and dealt with as required by law.  65.  The applicant’s complaint amounts to no more than she does not agree with the decision of the AAB, but that is not a basis for
judicial review.  It was open to the AAB to decide the issues as it did and make the findings that it made.  It cannot be said that
the decision offends the principles of public law or fairness.  As I have already stated, I am of the view that the application is
not reasonably arguable and is therefore refused.","Administrative Appeals Board

HKSAR v. CHOW KA WING [2018] HKCFI 1998; [2018] 4 HKLRD 566; HCMA 202/2018 (5 September 2018),"24.  Although we cannot go back in time, I have not a single doubt that had the appellant disclosed Exhibit D1 to the prosecution before
trial, it would have re-assessed its position.  And should the prosecution still decideto proceed, it would have to bear the consequences
of its decision including costs.  In fact, the prosecution always has an on-going duty to assess the strength of its evidence even
during trial.  It made a decision to proceed with the trial against the appellant after the contents of Exhibit D1 came to light.
 The consequence of that decision would be paying defence costs from the point of disclosure. 25.  Based on the reasons stated above, I allow the appeal, set aside the magistrate’s decision in refusing costs to the appellant,
and order that the appellant shall have costs of the trial, but limited to the portion after the contents of Exhibit D1 were revealed
to the prosecution, amount to be taxed if not agreed. 26.  Counsel for both sides have agreed in principle that costs of this appeal should follow the event.  Since the appellant is partially
successful, I make a costs order nisi that the appellant be entitled to 50% of his costs in this appeal, amount to be taxed if not agreed.  Unless either side appliesto

of s 18 (4) of the Ordinance, in that it was promoted and well known to customers of the Plaintiffs who subscribe to the Plaintiffs’
home telephone line services.  These customers constitute a relevant sector of the public under s 1 (4) of Schedule 2 to the Ordinance.
 66.  However, in view of my findings that the Defendant’s use of the Marks in the Advertisements for comparative advertising do not
take unfair advantage of or is detrimental to the repute of the Marks, and constitute use in accordance with honest practices in
industrial or commercial matters under s 21, there is no infringement under s 18 (4) of the Ordinance. 67.  Having considered all relevant factors, including the fact that the Defendant’s use of the Marks in the Advertisements does not
take unfair advantage of the Marks, is not detrimental to the repute of the Marks, and is not such as to deceive the public, I find
that such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.  Since a defence under s 21 of the Ordinance

Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. The Company has produced evidence to demonstrate that it was likely that the US Bankruptcy
Court would grant recognition and the ancillary relief necessary to enforce the Cayman scheme. I am satisfied from the evidence filed

process.  However, open justice requires that most hearings are heard in public and a member of the public may apply to the court
for copies of documents such as witness statements if sufficiently interested and they become part of the evidence before the court.
 It is for this reason that, I understand, it is now common in England for judge’s clerks to provide journalists with copies of
written submissions if they so request. 5.  Of course, in most cases only the parties are interested in the pleadings and, also in most cases, I assume, the parties have little
interest in making the pleadings that detail their private dispute available to others.  The present application is unusual. 6.  I accept that as the Bank is a public company and the present dispute will be of interest to many shareholders allowing publication
of the entire pleadings has utility.  It seems to me that it has a value in allowing shareholders who are interested to better understand

HO CHOR MING AND OTHERS v. HONG KONG CHIU CHOW PO HING BUDDHISM ASSOCIATION LTD [2018] HKCFI 2085; HCMP 506/2013 (7 September 2018),"1.  I consider that leave should be given because the decision may have more general implications beyond this case in relation to the
practice of assessment of the fees and disbursements of receivers. While the principles applied are not, in my view, novel and are,
indeed, of some antiquity, as is accepted on behalf of the Association this is the first case in Hong Kong — at any rate the first
case in which a reasoned judgment can be located — in which concluded assessments of a receiver’s and his solicitors’ bills
have been reopened on the application of the entity that has emerged from receivership. It seems to me that, if I may say so, the
subject would benefit from appellate consideration and determination. 2.  I am not particularly impressed by the proposed grounds of appeal or their prospects but I refrain from commenting on them except
that I should say a word about the allegation of serious irregularity. While some of the authorities referred to in my judgment were
not cited by counsel, many of them were used to counter the assertion made by counsel for the receiver that the fees and expenses
of a receiver are strictly a matter between the court and its own officer — a proposition which I in any event considered to be
contrary to natural justice and which Ms Lam, whilst not conceding it is wrong, has only faintly maintained on this application.
 Some of the other authorities concern the issue of providing the receiver’s accounts to the parties to the proceedings under Order
30 r 5, but that is an alternative juridical route for the conclusion I reached on the second issue identified.  The decision that I reached was, I believe, the case
advanced on behalf of the Association, namely, that as a matter of principle a company may be allowed to participate in the assessment
of its receiver’s fees and expenses, that the court has power to reopen or set aside assessments made in this case in the absence
of the Association, and that this discretionary power should be exercised by the court in the present case. 3.  Nevertheless, for the reasons I have already given, I think this is a case that is fit to go to the Court of Appeal.  The costs
of this application shall be in the cause of the appeal, with a certificate for two counsel for the Association and the Receiver.

of 6 months, with liberty to the parties to apply in the interim, to lift or extend the stay upon good grounds being shown. The adjournment,
which entails delaying enforcement of the Award, is conditional upon the Respondent’s payment into court within 28 days of security
in the sum of US$2 million. This should impose incentive to the parties to proceed with the relevant proceedings without unnecessary
protraction, and also reflects the need to balance the interests of the Applicant in the enforcement of a final and binding arbitral
award. 22.  The payment of security is subject to the usual order that in default of compliance with the order for security by payment into

RE WONG DUEN YUEN [2018] HKCFI 2227; HCMP 1060/2018 (12 September 2018),"4.  Under section 45 of the Trustee Ordinance (Cap 29), the Court is entitled to make a vesting order under various circumstances, one of which is this: “(e) where there is
no personal representative of a deceased trustee who was entitled to or possessed of any interest in land”.  My attention was drawn
to the decision of Deputy High Court Judge Marlene Ng in Re Lau Lee Wah (unrep, HCMP 2664/2015, 20 November 2015), in which the learned judge made a vesting order in similar circumstances. 5.  I am satisfied that this is a case in which the Court has the power to grant a vesting order under section 45 of the Trustee Ordinance and I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Court to do so.  I am also satisfied that there is no one to be served with the
originating summons in these proceedings and that it is proper for the application to proceed on an ex-parte basis. 6.  For the above reasons, I make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the originating summons and I also make no order as to costs.","IN THE MATTER of an application by Wong Duen Yuen（王端元）(Anson Wong, SC)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2227.html,"

those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have also been considered. 50.  The parties herein agree that the usual rule that costs should follow the event should apply.  There will accordingly be a costs

I have such a power pursuant to sections 119(d) and 36(1) of the Magistrates Ordinance.  Section 36(1) is the primary provision which stipulates: 249.  The offence cannot be said to be of trivial nature. There cannot be said to be no moral culpability.  It might have been a momentary
lapse and out of character but the conviction means that it was an intentional use of unlawful force by a senior police officer.
 I do not consider the circumstances surrounding the case and the mitigating factors available override the public interest in consideration
of the proper sentence in the present case so that a conditional discharge should be ordered.  I form my view having regard to the
fact that the Appellant had already spent 16 days in custody. 250.  For the reasons I have mentioned, I do not find the sentence imposed wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.  I therefore also

On the other hand, as has been explained at paragraph 15/16/2 of Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018, Volume 1: 15.  I have considered the contents of the Statement of Claim.  The pleaded facts clearly support the plaintiff’s case that it is the
victim of an email fraud, and that it has suffered loss in the amount of the Sum.  It appears entitled to relief based on its proprietary
interest in the Sum.  I bear in mind the fact that declaratory relief is being sought.  I need to bear in mind the rules of practice
set out above and decide how I should exercise my discretion.  I take into account the fact that fraud is pleaded and deemed established.
 I take further into account the fact that nothing is known about the defendant, including whether it has any other creditors.  The
plaintiff has a genuine need for the declaratory relief sought, so as to avert any need for it to race against other creditors. 
Fairness justifies it.  I note further that the respondent is neutral to the application.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
that the facts of the present case are such that I should exercise my discretion in favour of granting the declaratory relief and
the vesting order sought. 16.  For the above reasons, I grant the Orders in terms of the Summons, as amended by me, together with costs of the action and this

why the order for sale is sought.  The 1st defendant has filed no evidence.  The 2nd and 3rddefendants do not intend to defend the action.  They have taken no step in any attempt to show that the order for sale sought will
not be beneficial to all the co-owners, or that very great hardship to any co-owner will result.  Any concern which the Charging
Orders had given rise to has been addressed.  In the circumstances, I am of the view that the plaintiff has the right to ask for

there was no sufficient evidence that the Deceased was contemplating her own death in March 1991.  I do not find the 3rd requirement was satisfied. 100.  To conclude, having considered all the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the 3 requirements of a donatio mortis causa have been met in the present case. 101.  In light of the above, I dismiss Madam Hui’s application.  As the SoJ’s role was neutral, I am of the view that it is appropriate
to make no order as to costs.","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE 律政司司長

the opportunity and reason to do so.  Mr Yap says in [52] of his affirmation that Convoy has engaged an expert to ascertain the quantum
of damages.  The fact that he is unable to provide any evidence as to the rate that would have been within the range one would have
expected in his unnecessarily lengthy affirmation only adds to the impression I have that this claim is speculative. 25.  It seems to me that for the above reasons the claim against Kevin Cho in respect of the Circular Financing Arrangement should be
struck out. 26.  Given my decision I will make a costs order nisi that there is no order as to costs.","Date of Decision:

Mrs Chan next argued that even if the challenge to P’s locus standi in respect of his claim had been taken earlier, there would not have been much savings in costs since the proceedings in respect
of D’s counterclaim would mirror the parties’ respective contentions in P’s claim. However, at the stage, I am only concerned
with liability for costs, and not quantum of costs which is a matter for the taxing master. On the question of liability for costs,
I am unable to say that there would be no extra costs incurred at all for P’s claim that was outside the parameters of D’s counterclaim.
This is sufficient basis for the court to exercise its discretion to determine liability for costs in respect of P’s claim. However,
I hasten to add that the above observation does not in any way fetter the taxing master’s discretion and decision on assessing
taxed costs pursuant to any costs order that I make. 32.  Taking into account the above matters and all the circumstances of the case in respect of P’s claim, I consider that D should
be entitled to half of the costs of and occasioned by P’s claim. I therefore order P to pay half of D’s costs of and occasioned
by P’s claim in the present action, which costs included (a) costs of and occasioned by the 2nd PTR held on 31 August 2018, (b) half of the hearing time of the adjourned PTR held on 11 September 2018, and (c) all costs reserved

existence of the customers concerned, or how those requests were generated.  Nor didhe attempt to explain the accounting system of
the defendant which recorded and generated the “history reports”.  I have reproduced above what PM&T said in their reply
dated 28 August 2018 concerning the “history reports”.  Not even those matters have been confirmed by affirmation. 18.  In paragraph 10 of Kan’s 7thAffirmation, Mr Kan talks about funds “which belong to the customers and held in the trust account”.  He has failed to explain
what “the trust account” is.  During a previous hearing, I enquired with Mr Chan, counsel for the defendant, as to whether all
clients’ monies were held in trust account or accounts.  If they were, the identification of those funds would have been straightforward.
 I was informed that they were unfortunately not.  If Mr Kan is now saying that they were, he ought to provide details. 19.  Given the state of the evidence, Mr Chan sensibly accepts that the Summons is not adequately supported by the evidence.  He seeks
leave to withdraw the same.  In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out above, I grant the defendant leave to withdraw the

Without reciting those procedural steps which are described indetail in the 2ndAffirmation of Mr Mak, I am satisfied that the arbitrator hadgiven fair and reasonable opportunities to the Debtor to make submissions
before making those procedural orders in question.  Insofar as the Debtor chose to take up the opportunities to make submissions,
the arbitrator had duly taken into account and addressed those submissions before making the relevant procedural orders.  Indeed,
in relation to the complaint that the arbitrator allowed the Petitioner to adduce supplemental witness statementsand to amend the
statement of claim at a late stage of the Arbitration, it was the Debtor who had not responded to the Petitioner’s applications
despite being expressly asked by the arbitrator to do so.  Whilst the Debtor might be unhappy with the rulings of the arbitrator,
the materials available plainly do not support his complaint that he was unable to present his case properly in the Arbitration. 31.  In the circumstances, even assuming (but without accepting) that I am required to consider the Debtor’s complaints concerning
the process of the Arbitration in order to dispose of the matter before me, I amsatisfied that such complaints are entirely groundless
and that the Debtor wasgiven fair and reasonable opportunities to present his case in the Arbitration, which led to the making of
the Award.  Accordingly, I find that the Debt based on the Award is one which is due and owing, and that the Debtor has failed to
repay the same to the Petitioner. 32.  For the above reasons, I found it right to make the usual bankruptcy order.  Having heard the Petitioner and the Official Receiver,

in the interest of justice why the appeal shall be heard. 28.  For the foregoing reasons, the Leave Summons is dismissed, with costs to the Defendant. 29.  The parties are agreed that costs should be assessed summarily.  I have considered the Defendant’s Statement of Costs handed up
by Mr Chan at the conclusion of the hearing.  I do not propose to examine the items of costs individually.  I agree with Mr Lai’s
observation that counsel’s fee is plainly excessive.  The hearing was set down for 1 hour only, although it eventually lasted a
bit longer than that.  The application is a simple and standard one.  The Defendant’s counsel appeared before both Master S Kwang
and Deputy High Court Judge Saunders on essentially the same matter, and should be thoroughly familiar with the issues.  It would
take, in my view, no more than a few hours for a hypothetical, reasonably competent, junior barrister to properly prepare for the
hearing, including drafting the short written submissions of the Defendant.  Mr Lai, a very experienced barrister, asked the court
to allow only the fee that he himself charged.  While I cannot help but take note of Mr Lai’s fee, as a matter of principle the
fee paid by the other party should not be used as a yardstick when assessing counsel’s fee (see Ngan Wun Yeung v Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society, Kowloon and Others [1999] HKCFI 1237; [2000] 2 HKC 404, at 417). I therefore do not accept Mr Lai’s submission and will assess Mr Chan’s fee independently.  Solicitors’ costs are
also excessive.  In particular, the time spent on communications with clients and counsel seems to be disproportional, and there
should not be any need for the solicitors to do any “research” in the present case.  Overall, I would assess counsel’s fee
at $60,000 and solicitors’ costs at $30,000, making a total of HK$90,000, which is already a very substantial amount of costs for
resisting a simple application for leave to appeal.","CHUNG CHEUK HUNG, HERO

In other words, the 2017 Tribunal was not drawn to any submissions on the doctrine of res judicata and it was not part of the Commissioner’s case that Tiffany was estopped in law from raising the matter or issue again in the Appeal.[9] Tiffany was thus also not made aware of this ground of opposition in law. 73.  In the premises, I do not think it is fair in all the circumstances to ask Tiffany to bear the costs of this judicial review, where
the 2017 Tribunal Decision is quashed on the basis of a point of law not specifically relied upon by the Commissioner before the
2016 Tribunal. 74.  I therefore order that there should be no order as to costs in this application.",(Thomas Au)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2173.html,"

A v. ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS BOARD [2018] HKCFI 2205; HCAL 221/2017 (27 September 2018),"7.  Of the first ground, the AAB applied section 58(2) to the particular facts and circumstances of the case.  Of the second ground, it was open to the AAB to determine the issue of consent
as it did.  Of the third ground, which does not arise from the decision under challenge, the applicant complains that this Court
has breached the anonymity order made in this case by mentioning the civil action that the applicant brought in the District Court
in relation to the same parties and the same subject matter.  The applicant had not disclosed these proceedings to the Court.  In
the proceedings, the applicant, who was the plaintiff, was designated as “X” and was not referred to by name.  It should be noted
that this Court raised with the applicant the issue as to the appropriateness of an anonymity order given the nature and history
of the various proceedings.  See Re BU [2012] HKCA 306; [2012] 4 HKLRD 417.  Of the fourth ground, the applicant failed to act promptly as required by Order 53, rule 4(1) of the Rules of the High Court. 8.  None of these grounds have any merit, and the application is refused. 9.  It should be noted that by virtue of Order 59, rule 2B (3), where a Court refuses an application for leave to appeal, a further
application can be made to the Court of Appeal within 14 days from the date of the refusal.",Date of Decision: 27 September 2018(Kevin Zervos),Justice of Appeal,/2018/2205.html,"

of the statute. 34.  The Liquidators submitted that just as ad valorem fees under the CFPO are not payable in respect of realisations made after a compulsory winding up has been converted into a creditors
voluntary winding up under s 209A, so also realisations made during a voluntary winding up should not attract ad valorem fees notwithstanding a subsequent compulsory winding up.  But there is no real symmetry.  Once a company is put into compulsory winding
up, the winding up becomes subject to all facets of the compulsory regime.  On the correct interpretation of the statutory scheme,
the ad valorem fees are not being charged on realisations by the voluntary liquidators during the voluntary winding up; they are charged on the
amounts realised and brought to credit within the compulsory winding up. 35.  For all these reasons, the Liquidators’ summons will be dismissed.  There is no dispute that the costs of the Liquidators and
of the Official Receiver are to be paid out of the assets of the Company.","Total

Third, in relation to the merits of the Applicant’s intended grounds of judicial review mentioned in paragraph 15 above:- 20.  Fourth, there is the issue of proportionality. On any view of the matter, the charge against the Applicant is a trivial one. Should
she ultimately be convicted of that charge, the maximum penalty (according to Mr Leung) is only a fine of HK$500 (although a figure
of HK$2,000 was, I understand, mentioned by the Special Magistrate), and her complaint against the Decision made by the Special Magistrate
can form a ground of appeal against the conviction.  In such circumstances, I do not consider that the court should sanction another
set of satellite litigation with obviously undesirable consequences. 21.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed, with no order as to costs.",Respondent(Anderson Chow),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/2218.html,"

TIME SQUARE LTD v. LEE KWUN KIT T/A JL MUSIC AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2296; HCA 2244/2018 (28 September 2018),"4.  The Court has power to grant an injunction against a defendant described not by name, but by reference to his conduct provided that
the description is sufficiently certain to identify those who are necessarily included and excludes those who are not: see Billion Star Development Ltd v Wong Tak Chuen [2012] HKCFI 142; [2012] 2 HKLRD 85, at paragraph 54 per Au J, and Bloomsbury Publishing plc v News Group Ltd [2003] EWHC 1205;  [2003] 1 WLR 1633 at paragraphs 15 – 22 per Sir Andrew Morritt VC. 5.  I have considered the description of the 2nd defendants.  On the Writ they are described as “Persons unlawfully occupying or remaining at the Open Piazza of Times Square, 1 Matheson Street, Causeway Bay by busking or any other form of street performance, or persons who cause,place or leave obstruction(s)
at the Open Piazza in connection with the carrying out of such performances”.  I am satisfied that the description is sufficiently
certain.  Given the fact that the 2nddefendants is a class of persons not described by names, it is obvious that it is impracticable to serve any process or court document
on them in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the High Court.  I am also satisfied that the proposed means ofsubstituted service
(namely (1) in so far as the Writ and the Order permitting substituted service are concerned, by (a) fixing the same securely at
a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza, (b) by advertisement in one local Chinese newspaper and one local English newspaper; and
(c) by posting the same advertisements on the Website of Times Square; (2) in so far as this Summons and all subsequent orders are
concerned (including those which the 1stdefendant is required to serve upon the 2nddefendants), by (a) fixing those court documents securely at a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza; and (b) posting notices of the
same on the website of Times Square) are appropriate and adequate.  I grant the Order sought as amended. 6.  I however make clear that this Order only permits substituted service of the Writ, the Summons and all subsequent documents which
require service.  No injunction against the 2nd defendants has been granted.  That remains to be considered as and when any application for one is made (if one is made).","Date of Decision:

is no declaration by the expert, as required under Order 38 rule 37C (1).  The requirements of Order 38 rule 37 should be observed
in all cases where expert evidence is to be relied upon (see China Medical v KPMG, HCCW 435/2012, 24 February 2016, at paras 51 to 54), and there is no justification for parties and their advisers to be cavalier
about compliance with the provisions of Order 37 on expert evidence. 57.  The above matters are in my view sufficient to dispose of the application for receivership, and there is no need to deal in detail
with the Defendants’ and the 3rd Defendant’s claims of the adverse effect which they may suffer as a result of a receivership order on the Thai Co Shares, which

of Service has been filed.  Nor any defence. 6.  I have considered Order 32, rule 5 of the Rules of the High Court.  The defendant and its shareholder/director have chosen to take
no step in the defence of the action.  I have also considered the nature of the application before me.  A default judgment is more
often than not sought in the absence of the defendant.  I find it expedient in the circumstances to proceed with the application
despite the absence of the defendant. 7.  I have considered the submissions of Ms Pang who appears for the plaintiffs.  I have considered the appropriate approach when deciding
whether a default judgment should be granted: Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018 §19/7/11.  I have considered the authorities cited to me, which include Re Ping An Securities Ltd [2009] HKCFA 48;  (2009) 12 HKCFAR 808, Wadlow on the Law of Passing Off (5thed) at §10-25 (in support of the propositions that where a claim for passing off is made out, a permanent injunction is, in practice,
normally granted as a matter of cause; and if an injunction is granted, it is normal to order delivery up or destruction upon oath
of items the disposal ofwhich would infringe the injunction), and Kabushiki Kaisha Yakult Honsha vYakudo Group Holdings Ltd (No 4)  [2004] HKCFI 156; [2004] 2 HKLRD 587 at §39 (as authority for the proposition that even if the defendant did not start trading under the infringing name, the court will
require the name to be changed).  I have alsoconsidered the pleaded facts in the present case.  The name of the defendant is practically
the same as the Tradename.  The field of business is the same.  In my view, a clear inference can be drawn that that was not the
result of any unhappy coincidence, but that of a deliberate decision to pass off the Tradename.  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied
that a default judgment in terms of the Summons is justified, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the same on their Statement
of Claim.  I so order.","Date of Decision:

in those circumstances why Mr Yiu was led to mistakenly believe that, at the least, he should be allowed a second chance to retake
the LegCo Oath under the law.  This is particularly so given Mr Yiu’s relatively “milder” way in inserting the Extra Words

DAIRYFARM ESTABLISHMENT AND ANOTHER v. THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [2018] HKCFI 2245; [2018] 5 HKLRD 179; HCAL 234/2018 (8 October 2018),"45.  Having concluded that the Commissioner erred in law in rejecting Proposals 1(1), 1(2) and 2, it is not necessary for me to consider
the other grounds of judicial review (ie Wednesbury unreasonableness and fettering of discretion).  Neither would it be appropriate for me to do so because the Proposals have to be
remitted to the Commissioner for fresh consideration in any event (this being also the relief sought in paragraph 4 of the Originating
Summons). 46.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed, Decisions 1, 2 and 3 are quashed, and the Proposals are
remitted to the Commissioner for fresh consideration in accordance with this judgment, with liberty to the parties to apply for further
or consequential relief in relation to the tax reserve certificates purchased by DFE and DFCL in respect of the New Section 14 Assessments and New Section 21A Assessments in the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on how they are to be dealt with.  The Applicant shall be

UDEH DOMINIC ONYEMAECHI v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 2279; HCAL 785/2017 (8 October 2018),"6.  The applicant now submits by way of a letter dated 9 September 2018, that the delay was caused as a result of a procedural mix up
owing to his lack of knowledge of legal procedure.  He maintains that he had been advised by fellow claimants that he was required
first and foremost to apply for legal aid, which he did on 14 August 2018. He intended to apply for judicial review once he was in
receipt of legal aid however that took some two months to process and was eventually refused.  At that point he applied for judicial
review. 7.  The applicant had three months in which to apply for judicial review of the decisions of the Director and the Adjudicator.  Time
ran from the decision of the Adjudicator was dated 7 July 2017.  An applicant who has applied for legal aid is allowed a further
42 days in which to either file his Form 86 or, if filed, to have his application for leave determined.  The date would therefore
have been 17 November 2017.  If he had informed the court of his application for legal aid, the court would not have taken the view
that the filing of his Form 86 on 19 October 2017 was out of time.  This application therefore turns upon whether the applicant cam
show that he did indeed file an application for legal aid for judicial review and that it was refused later refused.  Whilst he purports
to append the application to the Director of Legal Aid for assistance, he has not done so.  The document in support merely indicates
he made an application but not what the application was for and this court is not in receipt of any notification from the DLA of
either an application or its refusal. 8.  In the above circumstances, I am prepared to grant leave to appeal this court’s order to refuse extension of time to apply for
judicial review on the condition that the applicant file with the court, documentary confirmation from the Director of Legal Aid
of his application for legal aid in respect of his application for judicial review and the date of refusal of that application, within
14 days of today.",Date of Decision: 8 October 2018(A P Campbell Moffat),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/2279.html,"

the light of such provision, there is no question of the tribunal being unable to consider the matter upon a remission by reason
of its being functus officio.  Even in the absence of an express power to remit, there is authority that an award which is either set aside or declared to be

in deciding whether to make an order for indemnity costs.  However, it is also a relevant fact that the Defendant did not succeed
on all issues at the trial.  In particular, the Defendant failed on an issue of fact, ie whether there was a binding contract between
the parties.  In my view, the Defendant’s denial of a binding contract was plainly unmeritorious, and unreasonable on the facts
of the present case.  Without that defence, the whole case would boil down to a simple question of construction, and I do not believe
that the trial would take 3 days to complete. 14.  In all the circumstances, I am not minded to vary the costs order nisi made by the Judge. 15.

time and not at the address he had provided to the Immigration Department.  It was only when he went to sign on that he provided
a new address and thereafter the relevant documents were sent to him.  He had no other excuse. 8.  The applicant has now been in Hong Kong since 2009.  He has been interacting with various government agencies for the entirety of
that period and accepts he received all necessary documents and notifications.  He fully understood that they required an up to date
address in order to correspond with him.  The explanation he has offered to this court, whilst frank, was not the same as he suggested
in the letter appended to the summons, which was that he did not understand the procedure.  The reason this application is late is
to be put entirely at his own door.  He was notified promptly of the decision of this court and, had he been living at his registered
address, he would have been made aware of what was required of him should he wish to appeal that decision.  It was incumbent upon
him to do so promptly.  He put himself in a position where that could not happen.  In any event, his underlying application has no
merit as explained in the initial refusal of leave.  It would not be in the interest of justice to grant an extension of time in
all the circumstances of this case. 9.  This application must be dismissed.",(A P Campbell‑Moffat)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2313.html,"

Ms Cheung raised a further argument that even if a Quistclose trust did arise in the first place, once the funds were paid into court, the designated purpose of the payment was carried out and
any remedy RGL and Casey Au had would be the ordinary one in debt: Twinsectra, §69.  Ms Au responded that where money is borrowed specifically and exclusively for the purpose of giving security for costs in
legal proceedings, giving rise to a Quistclose trust, such a trust does not necessarily vanish when the money is paid into court.  In Common Professional Examination Board ex parte Mealing‑McCleod [2000] All ER (D) 588, money was borrowed by the applicant from a bank for the exclusive purpose of giving security for costs in her litigation against
the Board.  After the applicant had won the litigation and obtained a favourable costs order, the Board applied for the money to
be paid out to satisfy costs orders made in other proceedings against the applicant.  The English Court of Appeal held that it was impermissible, because on the facts the money was subject to
a Quistclose trust when borrowed and, by necessary implication or as a matter of construction, it was a condition that if the applicant was successful
in the litigation, the money would go back to the bank, and the applicant was therefore bound as trustee to return the money to the
bank.  As it is unnecessary for my decision, however, I do not express any view on this argument. 28.  No submission has been made as to why the court should not make absolute the charging order if the two points raised are rejected.
 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that a charging order can be imposed on the funds in court standing to the credit of the action
HCA 1285/2014, for the payment of the judgment debts owed by Chris Au to the plaintiff herein, subject to the deemed security interest
of Kim.  I am also satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to make absolute the charging order and there will therefore
be an order in terms of the draft placed before me. 29.  There will be an order that Chris Au do pay the plaintiff’s costs of the application, to be assessed in a gross sum.  The plaintiff
shall forthwith provide its statement of costs to Chris Au; a statement of objections, if any, shall be lodged by Chris Au within
14 days thereafter, and a reply by the plaintiff within 7 days thereafter.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2297.html,"

In relation to creditors who are assignees based on the Liquidators’ receipt of Form 72 and other transfer documents, the Liquidators’
duty would be to recognise these assignees’ right to receive dividends.  No issue of revocation of the assignees’ right arises. 34.  In permitting the Liquidators to make the proposed distributions, the court would be applying conventional insolvency principles
and conflict of laws principles in relation to the RMB Asset which is governed by Mainland law.  Hong Kong insolvency law does not
confer new property rights on the Liquidators and giving effect to the limitations attached to the RMB Asset would not breach the

against D2, D3, D4 and D5 in this action. Although I have dismissed Ps’ such claim in paragraph 265(j) above, that was for the
purpose of finality. I note D2, D3, D4 and D5 were parties to the TCPSSA, and my findings above reflected that Ds’ camp acted reprehensibly
vis-à-vis Ps. In any event, I do not consider there would be significant costs incurred by D2, D3, D4 and D5 in the overall defence against
Ps’ claim which failed. I therefore consider a fair order for costs would be to make no order. 269.  By the order of Master S Kwang dated 28 May 2014, leave was granted for Ds to discontinue their counterclaim against Ps with costs
reserved to be argued before the trial judge. Thus, the issue of reserved costs was in respect of costs of and occasioned the abandoned
counterclaim (“1st Costs Issue”). In light of my findings in favour of Ps in respect of their claim which must impact on the vitality of their mirrored allegations
in the counterclaim, and given that Ds made a deliberate decision to abandon the counterclaim in the course of their security for
costs application which failed, there is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant an order that Ds do pay Ps’
costs of and occasioned by (a) Ds’ application for leave to discontinue the counterclaim against Ps and (b) Ds’ counterclaim,

At the pre-trial review on 26 February 2016, DHCJ Au-Yeung (as she then was) ordered that costs of such pre-trial review be reserved (“2nd Costs Issue”). Mr Hui fairly accepted it would be difficult for Ds to resist such costs as the costs for that wasted hearing arose out of matters
raised by Ds. I therefore order Ds to pay Ps costs of and occasioned by the pre-trial review on 26 February 2016 to be taxed if not agreed.","(d)

that has unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings and increased the costs. 33.  I would therefore order that:","Date of Decision:

ZPMC OFFSHORE SERVICE CO LTD (FORMERLY KNOWN AS SHANGHAI ZHENHUA HEAVY INDUSTRIES SHIPPING CO LTD) v. PHILIP JEFFREY ADKINS AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2291; HCMP 426/2017 (12 October 2018),"7.  It seems to me that there is a triable issue in respect of the majority directors’ motives in passing the resolution and whether
they acted in accordance with their fiduciary duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the Company.  The material issue is whether or not this is relevant.  Mr Zimmern argued that it is not principally
because RBF could not as a shareholder challenge the controversial resolutions and obtain the declarations, which are the converse
of those sought by the Plaintiff, pleaded in its Counterclaim.  However, this overlooks the fact that RBF has not commenced proceedings
against the Plaintiff seeking orders establishing that the controversial resolutions are invalid and joining the Company as a necessary
party.  RBF and Mr Adkin are defendants raising the alleged mala fides of the majority directors as a defence to a claim against them.  It may be, but I do not have to decide this question, that RBF could
not properly issue proceedings seeking the orders that it does in its Counterclaim for the reasons advanced by Mr Zimmern, but it
does not follow that having been made defendants to proceedings the purpose of which is to establish whether the controversial resolutions
are valid and enforceable that they are prohibited from advancing by way of defence the matters on which they seek to rely.  A similar
distinction was drawn by DHCJ Au (as he then was) in Hong Kong Century Property Development Ltd v Hui Nei Na.[5]  The Plaintiff’s argument amounts to suggesting that RBF has been joined simply so it is bound by the decision and that it is not
able to dispute the validity of the controversial resolutions. 8.  It might be suggested, although it was not, that even if RBF and Mr Adkin are able to advance the defences to the Plaintiff’s
claims pleaded in the Defence they are not able to pursue a counterclaim.  This seems to me a rather academic way of looking the
matter.  Essentially what is sought is the converse of the relief the Plaintiff seeks.  Particularly as it was not argued that even
if I was of the view that a triable issue had been shown in respect of the issues pleaded in the Defence, the Counterclaim should
be struck out, I will not give judgment dismissing the Counterclaim.  This is an issue that should be left to trial. 9.  I dismiss the Plaintiff’s summons and make a costs order nisi that the costs are in the cause with a certificate for two counsel.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2291.html,"

CHINACAST EDUCATION CORPORATION AND OTHERS v. CHAN TZE NGON AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2300; HCA 1062/2012 (12 October 2018),"65.  In view of my answer to the first question, there should not be an inquiry as to damages in the first place.  Even if I am wrong
on the first question, I am not satisfied that the 3rd defendant has proved that he had suffered any loss as a result of the Injunction Order.  The reasons are simply the same as mentioned
above.  There is a clear lack of cogent evidence to establish the 3rd defendant’s loss or that such loss was caused by the Injunction Order. 66.  Thus, if I have to proceed to answer the second question, my assessment of the 3rd defendant’s loss is nil. 67.  By reasons aforesaid, the Application is dismissed and the 3rd defendant is not entitled to claim any damages against the plaintiffs.

LAU SHAK WAH AND ANOTHER v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES [2018] HKCFI 2397; HCMP 1433/2018 (16 October 2018),"6.  Recently, which is two years later, Mr Chiu (who was one of two directors of the company) has been informed by his former Dubai
agent that Trilogy was once again active and would like to reactivate the agreement with the company.  This agent still has access
to potential investors, so potentially substantial income could be generated for the company if it were revived.  The former liquidator
of the company and Mr Chiu confirm that there is no irregular matter or transaction in relation to the company that requires investigation
nor any misconduct on the part of the applicants or any former officers of the company. 7.  The applicable principles are helpfully summarised in paragraph 6 of the judgment of Her Ladyship Kwan J (as she then was) in Re Outboard Marine Corp Asia Limited [2002] HKCFI 213; [2003] 1 HKLRD 585.  I only need to mention the more significant of the considerations.  As the exercise of the discretionary power is involved, the
burden is on the applicant to make out a sufficient case for a stay that carries conviction. 8.  This is a case where there are sufficient assets to pay all the creditors and expenses of liquidation.  The overriding considerations
are whether the stay is conducive or detrimental to commercial morality and to the interest of the public at large.  I am satisfied
that the company is solvent and has genuine commercial reasons for seeking a stay of the winding up on a permanent basis and it would
be an appropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant.","andTHE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES

HKSAR v. PATWARY MEZBA UDDIN OPU [2018] HKCFI 2287; HCMA 341/2018 (18 October 2018),"21.  In my view, the quantity of the cocaine contained in Exhibit P4 is so negligible that it would not have made a difference in the
starting point even if the magistrate had followed the practice suggested in GurungLaxman.  Had there been a separate “simple possession” charge in relation to Exhibit P4, it is almost certain that its sentence would
be imprisonment rather than other forms of punishment; and that its prison term would be served concurrently with the sentence of
the “trafficking” charge.  I see no injustice caused to the appellant.  In fact, the appellant received an additional 15% discount
for self-consumption in relation to Exhibit P4, despite its quantity not being a significant portion of the narcotics found in the
present case[5]. 22.  The appellant should consider himself fortunate that the magistrate did not enhance the sentence based on his immigration status
[6] . Drugs-related offences (especially “trafficking”) clearly have a serious detrimental effect on the community at large.  As
correctly pointed out by Mr Cheng, the magistrate had all the reasons to enhance the sentence and should have perhaps done so. 23.  The sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment imposed by the magistrate is not a day too long for the appellant.  I see absolutely no
reason to interfere with it.  The appeal against sentence is also dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

of the Commission’s appointment of the arbitrators in accordance with its powers under the Rules. 28.  By reason of the foregoing matters, I come to the conclusion that recognition of the Award should be refused under section 95 (3)
(b) of the Ordinance, as it would be contrary to the public policy of Hong Kong to enforce the Award, when there are valid grounds
to claim that the Guarantee was to secure the obligations under the HD Contracts and MD Contracts which are tainted by illegality,
but the tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons as to why it accepted the Guarantee to be valid and legally enforceable.  The
tribunal’s failure to explain adequately why it upheld the validity of the Guarantee also casts doubts on its acceptance of the

Chan J on 10 June 2016, is discharged. 83.  As for costs, the plaintiff is to pay the costs of the action against the 2nddefendant, including all reserved costs, to be taxed if not agreed.

to be taxed if not agreed, and the plaintiff is to pay the costs of the action of the 1st defendant thereafter, including all reserved costs, to be taxed if not agreed.

KWONG KA YIN v. CHEUNG HING WORLDWIDE LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2351; HCPI 89/2013 (19 October 2018),"112.  I therefore grant judgment in favour of P against D2 in the sum $900,000. Although costs should normally follow event, P failed
on the core of her factual contentions, which were subject of a not insignificant part of the pleadings, statement evidence and Trial/Re-trial
hearings. In my view, this should be properly reflected in costs. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P half of the costs of the action (including costs of the Trial and Re-trial, and all costs reserved if any) on
High Court scale to be taxed if not agreed. 113.  Bearing in mind that agreed quantum of damages was within the District Court jurisdiction, I have debated whether costs should have
been awarded on District Court scale instead. Mr Wong reminded since CA directed that the case be remitted to the Court of First
Instance for re-trial before another judge, and neither party applied to transfer the present action to the District Court, so both
parties should be held to costs consequences arising from such inaction. If this was the only basis for resisting costs on District
Court scale, I would not have been convinced. After the Civil Justice Reform, litigants (particular the claimant who has carriage
of the claim and who has the benefit of legal advice) should be alive to the need to conduct litigation in a cost-saving and proportionate
manner to avoid unnecessary costs, and failure to adhere to such underlying objectives invites sanction on costs by the court. Direction
by the CA for the case to be remitted to the Court of First Instance for re-trial does not prevent or absolve the parties from exercising
proactive case management to apply for transfer of the action to a suitable court venue for Re-trial where appropriate. 114.  But having carefully considered the matter, there was an additional element in considering disposal on costs. By the CA Order, the
CA reserved costs of the Trial for determination by the judge at the Re-trial. Since the Trial was actually tried before DHCJ Wilson
Chan (as he then was) in the Court of First Instance, it was doubtful whether a District Court judge would have jurisdiction to deal
with costs of the Trial tried in the Court of First Instance. In such circumstances, prudence required that the case be retained
in this Court of First Instance for Re-trial to avoid any jurisdictional concern or at least costly debate.","(e)

of the IRC Shares had passed to Prosper Talent upon the making of the Share Charges; and (ii) whether Prosper Talent was in contempt
by disposing the IRC Shares which were actually held in the name of Benefit Ahead, whereas the Injunction order only referred to
IRC Shares held in the name of General Nice Development. 52.  Apart from granting an order for variation of the Injunction as sought by Prosper Talent, I also make a costs order nisi that: (i) Prosper Talent’s costs of this application be paid by the Plaintiff on an indemnity basis; and (ii) the Defendant shall
bear his own costs of the variation application.  The order nisi shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Decision. 53.  I am grateful to counsel for all the assistance they have provided to this court.","Date of Judgment:

HKSAR v. KHAN ASIF ALI [2018] HKCFI 2359; HCCC 236/2017 (19 October 2018),"97.  Most inconceivable is the defendant’s allegation that despite him telling Mr Donald that he did not know there were drugs in the
packets, Mr Donald boldly and unethically in the presence of his instructing solicitor Mr Mohnani completely disregarded the defendant’s
instructions.  Furthermore that Mr Donald in his letter to the defendant of 25 October 2017[13] would confirm his indifference in writing to tell the defendant to not only tell the truth in his NPS but to state he was aware he
was trafficking in drugs but did not know what the actual drugs were.  98.  The defendant’s allegations against his two teams of legal representatives are wholly unfounded and implausible.  I am satisfied
that on all the evidence before me, the defendant’s plea of guilty was a deliberate, voluntary and a conscious considered decision.
 He was properly advised on the issue of knowledge and no pressure was applied on him to plead guilty. 99.  The defendant’s application to reverse his plea of guilty to not guilty is refused. ",(D’ Almada Remedios)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2359.html,"

RE CHINA SUNERGY (HONGKONG) CO LTD [2018] HKCFI 2399; HCCW 175/2018 (22 October 2018),"1.  On 26 June 2018 the petitioner issued a petition for the winding up of the Company on the grounds of insolvency. The petition has
come on before the court on a number of occasions. The last hearing took place before Mr Justice Anthony Chan on 15 October 2018.
The judge adjourned the petition in order to give the Company the opportunity to reach terms of settlement with the petitioner. Mr
Justice Chan expressly stated that this was the Company’s last opportunity to resolve the matter and that this should be impressed
upon the Company. 2.  An agreement has not been reached with the petitioner.  No evidence in opposition has been filed.  The Company was represented,
I use the term “loosely”, by Ms Chan, a solicitor with the Company’s solicitors, who has no rights of audience.  Ms Chan argued
that the Company wished to oppose the petition, although it has filed no evidence. 3.  In the circumstances it seems to me that there is no reason not to make the normal winding-up order which I do.  The Official Receiver’s
costs in the sum of $8,900 be paid out of the petitioner’s deposit and the balance repaid to the petitioner.","Date of Decision:

For the reasons above, save some minor amendments, I grant the Order sought via the Consent Summons, including the Declaration. 13.

applicationfor specific discovery in the present case) that their computer time recording system is not reliable, and was not relied on as an exhaustive record of time spent.  Where the reliability of the Further Bills is itself called
into serious question, the possibility of that consideration constituting “special circumstances” as would warrant the grant
of leave for taxation cannot be excluded. 53.  The prejudice point is not fanciful.  It reinforces the conclusion that the technical defences belatedly raised should not be allowed
to be advanced. 54.  Accordingly, for all the reasons stated above, the appeal must be allowed with costs (to be taxed if not agreed), and with certificate

shall be successful) the information which may be derived from the full, unredacted, version of the Plum Report and possibly other
documents to be disclosed, the Applicant may apply to amend the Form 86 and further evidence may have to be filed by the parties,
with the consequence that the hearing in February 2019 may be derailed.  This will be regrettable.  There are, however, a number
of different possible scenarios which it is not possible to predict at this stage with any degree of accuracy.  I do not consider
that I should refuse to grant leave to appeal on the mere possibility that the substantive application may not be able to be heard
in February 2019. 12.  For the foregoing reasons, I grant the Applicant leave to appeal limited to Grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the draft Notice of Appeal.

and the present summons.  I have indicated that P should perhaps consider substituted service. 24.  In any event, since the Assignment is clearly problematic, it is not clear at this stage whether D1 has obtained any title to the
Property.  It is also not clear under what circumstances or how Wing Cheetah became the landlord of P.  More importantly, the result
of the police investigation is presently unknown. 25.  For all the above reasons, I have declined to grant default judgment.  I dismissed P’s summons issued on 22 August 2018.  I gave

RE SWARANJIT KAUR [2018] HKCFI 2183; HCAL 488/2017 (29 October 2018),"4.  The applicant is an Indian national who came to Hong Kong in April 2013 as a visitor and since overstayed, and the basis of her
non-‌refoulement claim was that upon return to India she would be harmed or killed by her father’s creditor for refusing to marry
his son in exchange for the discharge of her father’s debt.  5.  As set out in my judgment, her claim was rejected by the Director of Immigration on the basis, inter alia,  that the risk of harm to her was a localized one and that it was not unreasonable or unsafe for her to relocate to other part of
India and hence there was no justification to afford her with non-refoulement protection, while in her subsequent appeal the Board
upon hearing her in evidence went further to conclude that her evidence relating to her father’s debt, the proposal for marrying
her to his creditor’s son and the threats made by his creditor to her in connection with the debt were not credible, and found
that she had failed to establish a genuine or substantial risk of being subjected to harm, or a real risk to her life or risk of
torture or persecution. 6.  In her application now before me the applicant is merely repeating her claim as before without putting forward any ground with any
prospect of success in her intended appeal.  Her application is totally without merit, and accordingly I refuse her application for
leave to appeal.",Date of Decision: 29 October 2018(Bruno Chan),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2183.html,"

RE ISLAM MOHAMMAD AMIRUL [2018] HKCFI 2379; HCAL 833/2017 (29 October 2018),"2.  The applicant now by a summons issued on 18 September 2018 applies for leave to appeal against my decision out of time, as Order
59, rule 2B(1) of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A stipulates that an application for leave to appeal against an interlocutory
judgment or order of the Court may only be made to the Court in the first instance within 14 days from the date of the judgment or
order. 3.  As the order being appealed against was made on 31 August 2019, the time to apply for leave to appeal expired on 14 September 2018,
and the applicant is therefore out of time by 4 days, for which he did not provide any explanation, and while 4 days would not usually
be considered as excessive, the fact is that the phrase of “may only be made” in Order 59, rule 2B(1) is unequivocal, indicating
that the application to this court in the first instance may only be made within the stipulated 14-day period, and as the power to
extend time under Order 3, rules 5(1) or (2) of the Ordinance should not apply to such an application, and in the absence of express
provision giving the court in the first instance power to grant extension of time to apply for leave to appeal, it must necessarily
follow that I do not have such power to do so in the present case: see Wynn Resorts (Macau) SA v Mong Henry [2009] HKCFI 667; [2009] 5 HKC 515; and Menno Leendert Vas v Global Fair Industrial Ltd & Ors (unreported) HCA 4200/1995, 23 April 2010, para 6.           4.

RE SULAKHAN SINGH [2018] HKCFI 2380; HCAL 897/2017 (29 October 2018),"3.  In his summons the applicant stated that he was not aware of my decision of 20 July 2018 until he went to the Immigration Department
to inquire about the progress of his case that he was informed of the decision when by then it was already beyond the 14-day period,
but in his supporting affirmation of the same date he also deposed that he did receive the letter from the High Court informing him
of my order and decision of 20 July 2018. 4.  Be that as it may and while the two weeks’ delay may not appear to me excessive, the phrase “may only be made” in Order 59,
rule 2B(1) is unequivocal, indicating that the application to the Court below may only be made within the stipulated 14-day period,
and that in the absence of express provision giving the court below power to grant extension of time to apply for leave to appeal,
it must necessarily follow that I do not have such power to do so : see Menno Leendert Vos v Global Fair Industrial Ltd & Ors (unreported) HCA 4200/1995, 23 April 2010, para 6).   5.

any errors in my decision.  In the premises and with no power to extend time, I accordingly dismiss his application.","Date of Decision:

in any of the grounds for their intended application and concluded that they are not reasonably arguable and hence in the absence
of any good reason to extend time, I dismissed their late application for judicial review. 5.  As for the rest of the 1st applicant’s submission, she merely repeated those same grounds as in her application for judicial review, namely lack of language
and legal assistance in her appeal before the Board which in my judgment did not advance any arguments against those reasons and
analysis set out in my decision.  In substance she is trying to argue the matter afresh which is not a course open to an application
on appeal: see Re Litoun Mounsy [2018] HKCA 537; and Re Nupur Mst [2018] HKCA 524. 6.  For these reasons I am not satisfied that there is any prospect of success in the applicants’ intended appeal, and I accordingly

for judicial review of the Board’s decision in rejecting his non-refoulement claim upon finding no explanation from him for his
more than six months of delay, or any good reason to extend time for such excessive delay, or any merits in his intended challenge,
and accordingly dismissed his application. 2.  The applicant now by a summons issued on 26 September 2018 applies for leave under Order 59, rule 2B of the Rules of the High Court,
Cap 4A to appeal against my decision, and exhibited to his supporting affirmation of the same date he provides some grounds of appeal
which I can only surmise to mean as follows: 3.  These are however just broad and vague assertions of the applicant without any particulars or specifics or relevant elaboration
as to how I erred or failed to apply high standard of fairness in refusing to extend time for his late application, or how I failed
to find that the Board had erred as asserted.  In the premises I am not satisfied that there is any prospect of success in the applicant’s
intended appeal, and I accordingly refuse to grant him leave to do so.","Date of Decision:

NG SHING CHIT v. LEE KIN CHU BY HER GUARDIAN AD LITEM GO MAN YIN [2018] HKCFI 2395; HCA 1228/2015 (29 October 2018),"40.  I do not accept Mr Ng’s evidence that Madam Lee ever represented to him that (i) if he would repay the loans, or continue to repay
the loans after Chi Chiu stopped making repayment, she would give him the Property after her death, or (ii) whoever (meaning or including
Mr Ng) repaid the loans would be entitled to the Property after her death.  I also find that Mr Ng has failed to prove the case against
Madam Lee as advanced by him in the Statement of Claim. 41.  Before I end this judgment, I would add the following observation.  This is a case where the Property has been transferred to Madam
Ng’s sole name for nearly 30 years.  If Mr Ng’s claim in respect of the Property is true, he has been sitting on his rights for
many years.  He fully repaid the loans to Liu Chong Hing Bank Limited no later than early 2006. He did not, however, commence this
action until June 2015 when, on his own account, Madam Lee has been disregarding his rights since about mid-2006.  In the meantime,
Madam Lee has become mentally incapacitated, thereby preventing her from giving oral testimony at the trial.  Mr Ng’s delay is
of course not fatal to his case, but it makes the court’s task more difficult in determining the true arrangement or agreement
between the parties which was not fully documented.  In my view, when the court is being asked to find that the registered owner’s
title to a property is subject to some oral trust or arrangement in such circumstances, the court must act cautiously, and should
look for clear and convincing evidence before upholding the alleged trust or arrangement. 42.  For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff’s action against the Defendant is dismissed, with costs to the Defendant (including all
reserved costs) to be taxed if not agreed.  The Defendant’s own costs are to be taxed in accordance with legal aid regulations.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2395.html,"

EVERWISE INVESTMENTS LTD AND ANOTHER v. HUNG WO CHIU AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2454; HCMP 1240/2014 (29 October 2018),"7.  I should add that the Official Receiver, who is of course the trustee of all the property as defined in the Bankruptcy Ordinance of the 4th defendant, has written on 19 October this year to the effect that the Official Receiver will not adopt the defences of
the 4th defendant.  8.  So, for the reasons I have endeavoured to state, I will accede to the declaration sought and I am told that on reflection, what
the plaintiffs desire is to have a declaration in the following terms, namely, that a declaration that the shares in the 1st plaintiff
are beneficially owned by Madam Wong (75 per cent) and Mr Jor (25 per cent).  And as I said, I will accede to that request and grant
the declaration as amended, in the above terms.    9.  So I would grant a costs order of this action against the 4th defendant to the plaintiffs, and such costs are to be taxed if leave

RE EDWEAD JOHN ALSO KNOWN AS EDWEAD SHAIBU [2018] HKCFI 2390; HCAL 76/2017 (30 October 2018),"9.  Hence it follows, as pointed out by Lam VP in his propositions, that in an appeal the scope for admission of fresh evidence and
for new arguments to be run is limited, and the general rule is that the appellant has to satisfy the requirements in Ladd v Marshall [1954] EWCA Civ 1;  [1954] 1 WLR 1489: see Hounkpedji Messanh v Torture Claims Appeal Board [2018] HKCA 152; Re Romail [2018] HKCA 186; Fayomi v Chief Secretary for Administration [2018] HKCA 194. 10.  As explained in the Board’s decision, the applicant’s claim of risk of harms upon return to Ghana for having been involved in
a hunting group and/or land guards prior to his departure in 2003 was rejected on his credibility, whilst those new COI exhibited
to his affirmation mostly referred to the current situation of the land guards in Ghana and their arrests and prosecutions by the
police for their illegal activities which are not relevant to the applicant’s alleged involvement back in 2003 or earlier, and
would not in my judgment advance his case any further given the findings by the Board, nor would they be accepted by the Court of
Appeal which as noted above would only examine my decision in light of the grounds, if any, advanced bythe applicant, as it is not
their role to examine the decision of the Board afreshas if it is a fresh application for judicial review, otherwise an applicant
could flagrantly disregard, as did the applicant in the present case, the stringent time limit under Order 53, rule 4(1) of the Rules
of the High Court, Cap 4A: see Re Qadir Sher [2018] HKCA 160; Re Rizwan alias Rizwan Gulistan [2018] HKCA 162; Re Ali Haider [2018] HKCA 222; Re Fitri Ambarwati and Maria Zubair [2018] HKCA 461; and Re Muhammad Usman [2018] HKCA 474. 11.  In the premises and for these reasons I am not satisfied that the applicant has put forward any reasonably arguable ground for his
intended appeal, or that it has any prospect of success, hence it would be futile to extend the time for appealing.  Accordingly
I refuse his application for leave to appeal out of time, and dismiss his summons.","Date of Decision:

same date he explained that he did not look early into his mail box to realize that the decision had arrived, and that after receiving
it he did not know what to do until he was advised by a friend to appeal that he realized that he was already out of time. 5.  While being ignorant of the law or the rule can never be an acceptable reason for delay, not checking one’s own mail for the court’s
decision is clearly in the circumstances self-inflicted, and as he did not provide any draft or proposed ground of appeal, I am unable
to see any prospect of success in his intended appeal either. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

and that Exhibit “A” is nothing more than just a copy of my decision and order refusing him leave. 8.  In the premises and as I am unable to see any reasonably arguable grounds advanced by the applicant or any prospect of success in

UNIVERSAL MUSIC LTD v. NEWAY MUSIC LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2403; HCA 1738/2017 (30 October 2018),"38.  If Neway Group has no defence to this action, then it is futile to stay the action pending the tribunal’s decision in the CT2
proceedings.  Furthermore, this action deals with Universal’s claim from 1 July 2015 whilst the CT2 proceedings only deal with
the grant of a licence under the HKKLA scheme that that ended on 30 June 2015.  They do not overlap.  The order to be made in the
CT2 proceedings will also not affect Universal as it is not a party to those proceedings and HKKLA was not its agent in operating
the expired scheme.  To allow the action to proceed will also not result in wastage in time and costs as there is no overlap between
this action and the CT2 proceedings.  It will also cause injustice to Universal if this action is stayed.  I therefore dismiss Neway
Group’s summons to stay proceedings. 39.  Since I have held that Neway Group has no defence to this action, Universal should be given judgment of this action.  Mr Yan has
objected to an order for Universal to inspect Neway Group’s karaoke servers.  I think that objection is valid and I omit that from
the orders I make.  I order: - 40.  I also make a costs order nisi that Neway Group do pay the costs of this action including the costs of the two summonses to Universal to be taxed on the indemnity
basis with certificate for two counsel.  I order indemnity costs because I regard this opposition by Neway Group as an abuse of process.
 The issues raised by Neway Group in its defence in this action have all been decided in the discharge decision.  Neway Group should
know where it stands.  Furthermore, it is also unreasonable in challenging Universal’s copyright ownership.  There is also the
dispute of delay made by each side against the other.  I do not think there is enough material for me to decide this dispute against
either or both of them. ",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2403.html,"

N v. W [2018] HKCFI 2405; HCCT 39/2018 (30 October 2018),"23.  In any event, the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate before this Court the serious prejudice it sustained as a result of the alleged
misconduct of the arbitrator.  If there was evidence of any actual misuse or wrongful disclosure of the Plaintiff’s confidential
information which had affected the Award, the Court might be more prepared to exercise its discretion in favor of the Plaintiff.
 On the face of the Award, it cannot be seen how the arbitrator’s findings on repudiation could have been affected.  The claims
of the Defendant’s alleged lies and credibility could have been made in the closing submissions to the arbitrator, irrespective
of whether he acceded to the Plaintiff’s request for adjournment. 24.  On the evidence, I reject the claim that the arbitrator had misconducted himself in the arbitral proceedings, or that there is any
defect or error patent on the face of the Award by virtue of his failure to address the existence of the Investigation and the issues
arising from the Investigation. 25.  It follows that the Plaintiff’s application is dismissed, with costs to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant on indemnity
basis (A v R (Arbitration: Enforcement) [2009] HKCFI 342; [2009] 3 HKLRD 389).",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2405.html,"

success.  I would refuse to grant leave.  Alternatively, even if leave to apply for judicial review was granted, I would dismiss
the judicial review on merits for the same reasons. 44.  There are no reasons why costs should not follow the event, in particular given that Mr Kwok effectively has had a substantive hearing

fromher either as she again failed to appear at the oral hearing for her application.   5.  As for the prospect of her intended appeal, the applicant in her supporting affirmation only exhibited copies of my decision and

The crucial point is that these genuine disputes of fact should be resolved at trial, rather than on affidavit evidence. 30.

referred to the fact that he has a bank account in Hong Kong, there is also no evidence suggesting that he has any meaningful assets
in this jurisdiction.  The only point taken by the plaintiff in respect of this application is on the merits of his claim but given

to make findings as to the factual matrix in relation to the MA/SD that would affect the proper construction/interpretation of the
“Outstanding Consideration”, which would inform the correct/applicable method of calculating Interest and Default Interest, so
the interpretation/consideration point should not be resolved at the summary judgment stage.[46] But in light of the above analysis, interpretation/construction of the term “Outstanding Consideration” was clear and unambiguous
from the perspectives of textualism, contextualism and business purpose, and they all point irrevocably towards P’s meaning as
the plain and ordinary meaning that made commercial sense. 113.  In the circumstances, Ds failed to raise any triable issue or arguable defence, and I discern no other reason for trial. The Master
Order was correct, and the Appeal is dismissed. 114.  The Leave Summons and Appeal are dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order
nisi that Ds shall pay P costs of and occasioned by the Leave Summons and Appeal (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if
not agreed. Mr Chang asked for certificate for 2 counsel. Whilst I have no doubt Ms Wong rendered helpful assistance to Mr Chang

bound to fail and advanced numerous unmeritorious arguments wasting D’s costs.  By pleading tenancy-in-common in equity without
pleading ouster, P3’s counterclaim is doomed to fail.  This pleading point aside, there was no evidence of ouster.  291.  Both actions are problematic.  The Father with the best of intention bequeathed his beneficial interest in the 2nd Land to the six children with the vision of creating an Eden Garden for all the eleven children, their spouse and their next generation
to use and enjoy as one parcel in common.  As the photographs I reviewed during the trial show, the plaintiffs and D were loving
siblings and loving cousins then.  But circumstances changed thirty years down in time with the Father’s demise.  They were no
longer loving and playful cubs but are now deadly tigers fighting fiercely for their territories and for a piece of meat fallen from
the neighbour’s door.  The Eden Garden has turned into a battlefield and an impasse.  The only way out is for the six children to mutually discharge their obligations under the 2nd 1982 Agreement and swap their lots and, better still, redefining the boundaries and entering into a mutual covenant to provide for
common area for vehicular access.  I pointed out, in particular, the disadvantageous position P3 was in and repeatedly gave judicial
encouragement to the parties for a settlement.  She ought to have discontinued her counterclaim just as D had discontinued his. 
But, my advice fell on death ears.  Being over confident of her chance of success, P3 obstinately pressed on with her counterclaim
which was doomed to fail.  I would not hide my sympathy for her.  A costs order against her is inevitable.  For one consideration,
I am not prepared to order indemnity costs without hearing full argument from both sides, that is, the action was commenced by D
rather unconscionably.  D had the benefit of the use of her land and yet turned around to claim its beneficial interest.  I shall

on costs than to make an indemnity costs order nisi and to give P3 the burden of resisting the order. 292.  Because of the unity of possession P3 is not entitled to demand D as a co-tenant to deliver vacant possession of Lot 809 to her
or to demand rent or mesne profits.  Furthermore, having regard to the investment incurred by D as result of the three understandings,
it would be unconscionable to allow P3 to withdraw her consent and to demand delivery of vacant possession of Lot 809 from D.  Accordingly,

or to demand rent or mesne profits.  Furthermore, having regard to the investment incurred by D as result of the three understandings,
it would be unconscionable to allow P3 to withdraw her consent and to demand delivery of vacant possession of Lot 809 from D.  Accordingly,
P3’s counterclaim is dismissed with a costs order nisi that she shall pay D’s costs of her counterclaim on party and party basis.","1 January 2015 - 31 October 2018

as the Class 4 documents.  I am satisfied that the legal requirements for the discovery of both the Class 3 and Class 4 documents
have been satisfied. 11.  I am unable to see any real ground for resisting this application.  Subject to the curtailment of the proposed scope of the order
as discussed in this hearing, I allow this application with costs incurred to date to Hyundai Marine.  An appropriate draft order
should be provided to the court for approval. 12.  As regards Ma’s discovery application, he has failed to appear to prosecute the same.  It is dismissed with costs to Hyundai Marine.

in paragraph 4, I would cross out the words in parenthesis because the costs of the summons is to be separately provided for in the
other order that I am asked to and will make. 13.  In respect of the summons, I have been given a draft order at the beginning of the hearing.  After discussion with Mr Lam, I consider
that the correct course is to make an order in response to the summons, and a judgment for the action, and that is what I will endeavour
to do. 14.  On that basis, in respect of the summons, I will make an order in terms of the draft submitted to me subject to the following amendments.
 First is that in paragraph 1 I will make an order in the following terms: no defence having been filed by the defendant, judgment
be entered against the defendant as per the judgment dated today, and by that judgment I mean the judgment that I will make essentially
in terms of pages 5 and 6 of the bundle; paragraph 2, I will say costs of the summons be to the plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agreed;

A v. ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS BOARD [2018] HKCFI 2402; HCAL 221/2017 (1 November 2018),"5.  Further, I shall concentrate on the merits of the Applicant’s proposed appeal in view of the fact that the delay is a short one.
 On the merits of the proposed appeal, the following finding made by Zervos JA in the Substantive Decision are significant:- 6.  The present application is not supported by any affirmation going to the merits of the proposed appeal, nor any draft grounds of
appeal.  Her four proposed grounds of appeal in support of the previous application for leave to appeal were dealt with by Zervos
JA in the Leave Decision.  At the hearing before this court on 26 October 2018, the Applicant raised the further argument that the
AAB had no power to interpret the relevant provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486, but must first seek the court’s opinion on the true interpretation of those provisions before making its decision.  I
am unable to accept this argument.  If the AAB makes an error of law, it can of course be corrected by the court in an application
for judicial review.  This does not mean, however, that the AAB has no power to interpret a statute for the purpose of determining
an appeal before it. 7.  Overall, there is nothing in the materials before the court to show that there is any arguable ground of appeal against the Second
Leave Order.  Accordingly, the Applicant’s summons dated 12 October 2018 is dismissed, with no order as to costs.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2402.html,"

QUADPACK ASIA PACIFIC LTD v. HANG SENG BANK LTD [2018] HKCFI 2502; HCMP 1286/2018 (1 November 2018),"10.  The first amendment I will make is to delete the first six words in paragraph 1 of the originating summons because I take the view
that there is no need to state the jurisdiction for the order sought. 11.  The second amendment is in respect of the schedule.  For paragraphs 2, 5 and 6, I would add the words “documents relating to”
before each of these paragraphs.  I would also delete the words in paragraph 4, “information relating to the receiving account”,
and all these amendments were discussed with Mr Lai and he has no objection to them.   12.  As I said earlier, Mr Lai has fairly suggested that the time for provision of documents should be 28 rather than 14 days in paragraph
1 and also that there should be an additional paragraph, I suspect between 2 and 3, expressly providing that the plaintiff do reimburse
the defendant for the costs and expenses in complying with the order in paragraph 1 on a full indemnity basis.","Date of Decision:

HKSAR v. POON CHUN TUNG [2018] HKCFI 2407; HCMA 226/2018 (2 November 2018),"18.  I have reminded myself of the principles on “re-hearing” in magistracy appeals stated in HKSAR v Chou Shih Bin [2005] HKCFA 17; [2005] 1 HKLRD 838 and HKSAR v Ip Chin Kei [2012] HKCFI 1096; [2012] 4 HKLRD 383.  I find no flaws in the magistrate’s reasoning or findings.  In relation to PW3’s evidence,I do not find any of his behaviour
as shown in the CCTV footage remotely indicative of the “planting” allegation made by the appellant.  It is my finding that PW3
did not unwrap anything when he bent down at the metalrailings and that his waving gesture had no significance.  Most importantly,
what he picked up at the metal railing was the cell phone dropped by the appellant and nothing else.  As a juror, the magistrate
is entitled to accept PW2’s evidence that he found Exhibits A and B in the appellant’s right trouser pocket. 19.  Based on the reasons stated above, I see no reason to interferewith the magistrate’s decision.  The appellant’s conviction is
neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory. 20.  The appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

refuge in a foreign territory.  Hong Kong owes those people nothing but has generously extended its hospitality to them.  The bottom
line is they need to behave themselves and obey the law here.  This is certainly not one bit too much to ask for and is the least
those people could do in return for the protection offered to them by Hong Kong. 15.  Ms Fung for the respondent has in her written submissions fairly drawn my attention to the issue of deduction for administrative
detention[3]. I agree with Ms Fung that the deduction does not apply in the present case.  It was not raised by the appellant’s trial counsel
during mitigation either. I see no reason why I should exercise my discretion to reduce the appellant’s sentence on this basis. 16.  This appeal has no merits whatsoever and must be dismissed.   ","Date of Judgment:

 In the same vein, the Plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of showing the need for fortification, not to mention the appropriate
quantum for the same.  Accordingly, I find no substance in Grounds 5 and 6. 18.  By reason of the above matters, the Plaintiff’s application for leave to appeal is dismissed.  I order that costs of and occasioned

not think that is applicable because this is an “ex parte on notice” application. 5.  In the light of the conduct of the defendant, namely, in excavating the ground on which a right of way exists in favour of the plaintiff,
I do accede to the ex parte application and grant the order in terms suggested by the plaintiff. 6.  Returnable date is 23 November 2018 at 10 am before the summons judge. ","Date of Decision:

will be caused to that shareholder or his estate by the order that I will make shortly.  That is because of the evidence available,
the restoration is only to procure the contents of the account to be restored to the Company. 8.  I should note also that there was a request for a declaration that the Company shall be regarded as having continued in existence
if it had not been dissolved. After discussion about necessity, I understand that the applicant no longer pursues this request. 
In any case, I am not satisfied that there is in the evidence a justification for the necessity of such a declaration at this stage. 9.  For the reasons above, I will make an order in terms of the draft order submitted to me subject to the following three amendments.
 The first is that in paragraph 1, after “the Company”, I will insert the number “0530918”.  The second amendment is the
deletion of paragraph 2.  The third amendment is to change in paragraph 6 the sum of $5,000 to $6,750.  These are amendments that

against the decision of the Master is accordingly dismissed.  I order the costs of the appeal to be to the plaintiff, on a nisi basis. 30.  The plaintiff seeks leave to amend the reply as per a draft supplied to the court.  These amendments were not opposed by the defendant.
 The parties, pragmatically, agreed that, since some amendments are to be made to the statement of claim irrespective of the outcome
of the appeal, that there should be just one round of amendments.  Thus the defendant is to respond to the amended statement of claim
with consequential amendments within 21 days of the date of this decision, and the plaintiff is to be at liberty to make necessary
consequential amendments to the reply within a further 21 days. 31.  There is, accordingly, no other order to be made on the plaintiff’s ‘reply’ summons.","Date of Judgment:

not been asked to consider this matter.  In those circumstances I did not consider that it was an abuse of the court’s process
to raise it now. 31.  As I have indicated Mr Donald’s submission having failed I am content to view this evidence in light of the Deputy Judge’s earlier
assessment of it and accept hisconclusion as to its relevance and probative value.  His approach to the degree of prejudice I would
likewise endorse, but add that as an abundance of caution I should direct this jury that they could not possibly consider that this
evidence supported any assertion that there had been earlier acts of drug dealing or trafficking by the accused.  I was advised by
Mr Chau that such a suggestion was no part of the prosecution case and would not be made by him. 32.  I refused the application.","Date of Reasons for Ruling:

HEITKAMP &AMP; THUMANN KG v. LIVING PROFIT TRADING DEVELOP LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2475; HCA 151/2017 (9 November 2018),"42.  My attention was also drawn to the D2 Statement which set out D2’s reasons/stance for the Leave Summons. In the D2 Statement,
Mr Lai submitted: 43.  In respect of the contention in paragraph 42(a) above, I reiterate paragraphs 29(b) and 31 above. As for Mr Lai’s submissions
in paragraph 42(b)-(c) above, they echoed the criticisms in the Draft Notice set out in paragraph 40 above that this court had acted
in a “non-partisan manner” and failed to exercise “neutral, fair and judicious discretion”. But in the absence of allegation
of actual bias on the part of this court, the manner of formulation of such grounds/submissions was not easy to understand. It is
inappropriate for this court to make an unseemly spectacle of entering into debate over such allegations (despite the seriousness
of the criticism of breach of judicial conduct) save to adopt the observations by the Court of Appeal in Win Glories Limited v Majorluck Limited[20] and Yap Sui Kong v Yip Fong Tim (sued as personal representative of the Estate of Ip Tseung Hong alias Chiu Loi, deceased)[21] on the court’s expectation of a professional approach worthy of counsel in drafting court documents and submissions. 44.  In the circumstances, the Leave Summons is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I grant a costs order
nisi that D2 shall pay P’s costs of and occasioned by the Leave Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed forthwith
if not agreed.","(c)

G H PROPERTY HOLDINGS LTD v. ABLE PROFIT INVESTMENT LTD [2018] HKCFI 2480; HCA 878/2017 (9 November 2018),"38.  The Third Question is a question of law and/or construction and is, on the face of the it, suitable for determination by the Order
14A procedure.  However, my ability to resolve the Third Question is linked to the conclusion I reached on the First Question.  The
plaintiff seeks an order that it is entitled to exercise the option under clause 2.05 to accelerate the sale and purchase of the
remaining 39 Sale Shares and the remaining SH Loan.  As the option to accelerate is premised upon the enforceability of the Agreement,
the matter cannot be resolved summarily given the conclusion I reached on the First Question. 39.  The main battle between the parties is on the First Question.  The resolution of the Second Question (involving limitation/laches)
is unnecessary if the defendant is successful on the First Question at trial.  The question is one that is not determinative of the
action and which may at the end of the day be an academic.  In the circumstances, despite the strong arguments advanced by the plaintiff,
I decline to determine the Second Question. 40.  In light of my conclusions on the three questions, I will allowthe defendant’s appeal.  The Order of the learned Master dated
30 July 2018 is set aside and I also make an order nisi that the defendant is to have the costs of the appeal and below with certificate for two counsel.","ABLE PROFIT INVESTMENT LIMITED

TIGER RESORT ASIA LTD v. KAZUO OKADA AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2788; HCA 3017/2017 (9 November 2018),"10.  That being the case, Mr Kwan will have to justify why he is entitled to have the matter reargued.  The topic is not dealt with in
his written submissions. No material change of circumstances has been pointed to.  Nor did the matters raised in Haldanes’ letter
of 23 August 2018 constitute in my view any material change of circumstances.  They suggested that the cases of D1 and D5 were not
supported by any documentary proof.  Those allegations go to merits of the parties’ case, which will be considered during the substantive
hearing.  In so far as D1’s arrest is concerned, Haldanes relied on it to show increase in the risk of dissipation.  Mr Kwan adopts
that.  I do not at this stage see any necessary causal relationship between the two.  The information on the arrest before me is
limited.  I take heed of what Mr Pang has informed me, that the ICAC has in fact returned to D1 his passport upon court order.  I
further note that the Third Sum had been paid over more than two years ago.  But importantly, the plaintiff is before me this morning
seeking a proprietary injunction in relation to the Third Sum.  Mr Kwan has emphasized this a number of times in his submissions.  As Mr Kwan has pointed
out at paragraph 40.2 of his submissions, when it comes to proprietary injunction, there is no need to show risk of dissipation.
 Mr Kwan submits that whilst that is so, the change remains relevant and sufficient to justify the relisting of the application.
 I do not agree.  As Mr Pang has submitted, risk of dissipation not being a necessary element for the grant of a proprietary injunction,
any change in that regard should not be regarded as a material one in the context of an application for one. 11.  In the circumstances, I agree with Mr Pang’s submissions that seeking the same interim-interim relief which has previously been
denied by the Court where there has been no material change of circumstances is contrary to the underlying objectives in Order 1A
of the Rules of the High Court, in particular Order 1A, rules 1(a), (b), (c) and (f). I refuse to entertain it. 12.  By reason of the above, I refuse to entertain the application.  I will proceed to hear the parties on costs.","Date of Decision:

HKSAR v. WONG SAN WING [2018] HKCFI 2301; HCMA 39/2018 (12 November 2018),"40.  There was no need for the magistrate to draw any inferences in this case save for the obvious one of whether there was a meeting
of minds.  He, and I, reject the evidence of D1 and D2 and accept the evidence of PW1.  D1 knew exactly what she was doing and went
to the lengths of providing a town gas bill for a property she did not live in.  D2 also knew the ruse, because he lied to PW1 and
he did so, at the outset, during the interview in the restaurant and maintained the illusion thereafter.  There were a number of
proven facts which overwhelmingly suggest that D1 and D2 both intended to defraud the Department and that they did so in a joint
scheme for which D2 was paid and D3 gained an employee. 41.  As to the suggestion that the magistrate acquitted D3 and therefore this court should infer that there could not have been a meeting
of minds as between D1 and D3, this court’s understanding of his reasoning differs from that of the appellant.  The court’s understanding
of his reasoning is that, although she was substantially implicated, the magistrate was not sure beyond reasonable doubt that she
really understood the system.  In order to find a conspiracy to carry out a substantive offence, the magistrate had to be sure that,
at the moment of the agreement, D3 knew what the substantive offence was and intended to commit that substantive offence.  It was
not a conspiracy to employ a FDH but a conspiracy to submit false documentation to the ID.  Whilst the magistrate did not find that
part was made out beyond reasonable doubt because of her background, he nevertheless believed her to be complicit in an agreement
to employ a FDH.  By contrast, D1 was a business woman and would have known the process and D2 was in the business of seeking employment
visas for FDHs.  Neither were ignorant of the system and on D1’s own admission, she purported to be the employer knowing full well
she was not. 42.  Accordingly, this appeal against conviction is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.","Date of Judgment:

Alternatively, I further agree with Mr Chan for the Director’s submission that, in light of Wong Ho Tong, the present judicial review application has become academic, and hence the court should not entertain it.  This is because, given
the Director’s indisputable judgment that the Registered Hut in the present case had been replaced by a new building,[25] the applicant’s squatter registration is liable to be cancelled irrespective of the outcome of this case, and in that event, the
applicant would not have any public law recourse.  In this respect, it is noted that it is the applicant’s own case that the real
purpose of seeking to set aside the Decisions is to seek to have an opportunity to reinstate the Registered Hut.[26] 65.  For the above reasons, the court dismisses this judicial review. 66.  Given that I dismiss the judicial review on the basis of Wong Ho Tong, which was handed down after the substantive hearing of this application, I think a fair and just costs order in the present case

defendant could also be heard. 3.  Now, the opportunity for the defendant to be heard has been made available in the present case.  Although the evidence suggests
that the defendant could not be located, there was the order for substituted service of these proceedings on the defendant.  No appearance
has been entered. The evidence also suggests that apparently the defendant was the daughter of Choi and Lam, and that actually added
to the suspicion about the purported conveyance by Choi and Lam to the defendant back in 1974 just days after the commencement of
that action.   4.  There is nothing to contradict the evidence that the plaintiff in the present case has been in exclusive possession of the two lots
of land since 1976, and in these circumstances, I see no reason why the order sought should not be granted.  In the circumstances,
I would also grant, first of all, the order stated in paragraph 3 [1] of the originating summons as well as paragraph 1 [2] of the originating summons, and following that, an order stated in paragraph 2 [3] of the originating summons. As indicated, I will give no order as to costs.","LAM CHI MAY BESSIE

RE KHARSU NUMAN [2018] HKCFI 2422; HCAL 168/2017 (16 November 2018),"4.  In the applicant’s case a delay of more than one year must be regarded as very substantial or excessive.  In his supporting affirmation
of the same date he explained that he did not receive any letter from the Court and hence was not aware of the decision until much
later when he was detained by the Immigration Department that he was told of the decision, and as he had to seek advice from his
friends that a long time had lapsed by the time he decided to lodge his appeal, but at the hearing of his summons before me, he was
unable to explain why the decision did not reach him at his last known and reported address from where he has not moved at all material
time up to now.  In the premises I do not accept that he has provided any valid reason for such excessive delay. 5.  To decide whether there is any good reason to extend time it would be relevant to consider the prospect of his intended appeal by
referringto the proposed grounds of appeal, of which however he did not provide anydespite his claim to have good grounds in his
affirmation, and in the absence of any particulars as to any error in the decision or why it was unreasonable or unfair, I am unable
to see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

of the same date he did not provide any explanation, but at the hearing of his summons he explained that as the flat in which he
was residing in one of the cubicles was under renovation and hence all the mails were collected by the security guards for distribution,
and it was only on 17 October 2018 that he was given the Court’s decision that by then he was already out of time.  While I accept
his explanation for the delay, I am unable to find any merit in his intended appeal. 5.  Not only did he fail to produce any draft or proposed ground of appeal, he in fact admitted at the hearing that he could not find
any error in the decision, and that the only reason why he wanted to appeal was so that he could remain in Hong Kong until his problems
back home in India may be resolved next year or so.  As such I am unable to see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

HKSAR v. BALJINDER SINGH [2018] HKCFI 2450; HCMA 307/2018 (16 November 2018),"13.  In my view, the crux of the prosecution case is what PW1 sawthe appellant doing rather than how long the observation lasted.  As
a juror, the magistrate has accepted PW1’s evidence.  She has found as a fact that the defendant was inserting a metal pole into
a hole on the ground at the subject hawker stall.  She then concluded that no reasonable person who was unconnected to the subject
hawker stall would have done such work. I agree with the magistrate. 14.  I have reminded myself of the principles on “re-hearing” in magistracy appeals stated in HKSAR v Chou Shih Bin [2005] HKCFA 17; [2005] 1 HKLRD 838 and HKSAR v Ip Chin Kei [2012] HKCFI 1096; [2012] 4 HKLRD 383.  I find no flaws in the magistrate’s reasoning or findings.  The magistrate has thoroughly evaluatedthe prosecution’s evidence
as well as the case put by defence counsel.  Heranalysis is sound and with proper evidential basis.  I see no reason to disturb the
magistrate’s findings. 15.  I dismiss the appeal against conviction.","BALJINDER SINGH

NG FUK SHING v. NG FUK NAM AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2528; HCA 611/2015 (16 November 2018),"80.  The above analysis clearly showed there would not be any crisp answer to the 2nd Question that would obviate the need for a full trial, and there would still be significant disputes that would have to be disposed
of at trial even after answering the 1st/2nd Questions, which questions I am afraid were not pure legal matters. I am not persuaded that a trial of preliminary issues as proposed
by Ds would be necessary or appropriate. 81.  For all of the above reasons, the Summons is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant
a costs order nisi that Ds should pay P costs of and occasioned by the Summons (with all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed with certificate
for two counsel. 82.  I take this opportunity to urge the parties to carefully consider whether the Government should be joined in the present action,
so that (a) any cause of action or defence that required their presence could be perfected, (b) any order made would also be binding
on the Government, (c) there could be finality in resolving all relevant disputed issues, and (d) the Government’s stance as to
the proposal on “surrender and re-grant”, encroachment presumption and/or adverse possession could be properly elicited, and
the parties’ respective case properly determined in light of the same. It is pertinent at this stage to take note of Mr Khaw SC’s
submissions in paragraph 68 and footnote 37 above. Given the interlocutory nature of the Summons, it was sufficient for this court
to highlight certain aspects of perceived concerns if the Government was not involved such that there would not be procedural benefit/savings
in proceeding with a trial of preliminary issues, and it was unnecessary for this court to come to any definitive view at this stage
as to whether or not the Government ought to be brought into the present action. But this consideration should exercise not just
the parties but also the court case manager as the present action moves inexorably on towards trial.","(d)

the same importance.  The defendant’s observation summarized in para 6(2) to (4) above should therefore be taken into consideration. 12.

factors, or had considered irrelevant matters, in exercising his discretion to accept the limited cross-undertaking as to damages,
and fixing this in the sum of HK$40 million.  There are no reasonable prospects of success that the Court of Appeal would disturb
the judge’s decision and his assessment of the appropriate amount for the cross-undertaking. 23.  Since I consider that there is no reasonable prospect of success for the appeal against the grant of the Injunctions, the same applies
to the proposed appeal against the disclosure order.  Nor am I satisfied that there are reasonable prospects of success for the intended
appeal against the costs order, when costs are discretionary and there are reasonable grounds for ordering that the costs should
be in the cause in this case. 24.  For all the above reasons, the application for leave to appeal has no reasonable prospects of success in my view, and ought to be

that is that the Petitioner came into the shoes of the original petitioner by way of substitution as explained by Mr Chiu. However,
it is quite clear from the Amended Petition that it is premised on the failure of the Company to meet its obligations under the Settlement
Agreement despite various demand letters. 7.  In any case, even if the court is to assume that the Company is solvent, I fail to see why the Company can persist in not paying
its creditors. I should add that this kind of behaviour constitutes a danger to the other traders who may deal with the Company without
knowledge of the habitual non-payment of debts on its part. 8.  For these reasons, subject to the above undertaking by the Petitioner, I grant the relief sought in prayers (i) and (iii) of the

IN THE MATTER OF NANIK DAYARAM(also known as NANIK DAYARAM HATHIRAMANI)

Before: Master Lui in Court



Date of Hearing: 26 June 2018 
Date of Decision: 20 November 2018

___________________
THE APPLICATION AND BACKGROUND
1.  This is an application (by summons dated 17 May 2017) for suspension of automatic discharge from bankruptcy for a period up to 4
years by the Joint and Several Trustees in bankruptcy (“Trustees”) of Nanik Dayaram (“Dayaram”), pursuant to section 30A of the Bankruptcy Ordinance, Cap 6 (“the Ordinance”).
2.  Dayaram was adjudged bankrupt on 13 June 2013 as a result of a petition dated 7 December 2011 presented by a creditor, namely the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (“HSBC”). But for this application and the interim suspension orders, Dayaram
would have been discharged from bankruptcy on 13 June 2017. Mr Osman Mohammed Arab and Mr Wong Kwok Keung of RSM Nelson Wheeler Corporate
Advisory Limited were appointed the Trustees on 23 July 2013by a resolution passed at the first meeting of creditors.
3.  Dayaram submitted his Statement of Affairs to the Official Receiver’s Office on 15 July 2013 and his Preliminary Examination of
Bankrupt to the Trustees on 8 November 2013. He said that he did not own any stocks, shares, bonds, unit trust and other financial
securities in his Preliminary Examination of Bankrupt. He, however, disclosed the following assets in his Statement of Affairs:-

(a) HK$71,907.72 (cash in banks);
(b) Investment in stocks and shares in Days International Limited (incorporated in Hong Kong) (in compulsory liquidation) (“Days
International HK”); and
(c) Membership of Hilltop Country Club.

4.  Following the appointment of the Trustees, they started the usual investigation and raised many round of enquiries with Dayaram
by sending him written requests for information and documents.
5.  As at the date of the present application (17 May 2017), according to the Trustees, the total value of the proofs of debt submitted
were over HK$ 221 million and USD$ 39 million.
6.  On 11 August 2015, Dayaram was convicted by a jury of nine counts of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment,
which consisted of making and submitting false invoices and false bills of lading to banks, including HSBC, in order to obtain loans
which have remained overdue and outstanding: HKSAR v. Nanik Dayaram HCCC 2/2014 (unreported) 11 August 2015.
7.  Because of the criminal trial, Dayaram had been remanded in custody on 6 August 2015. Although he was later granted bail pending
appeal against conviction and sentence on 24 August 2016, he returned to prison on 19 January 2017 to serve the remainder of his
sentence.
8.  The Trustees make the present application to object the automatic discharge and they rely on the following 2 grounds as provided
for in sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance respectively, that:-

(a) Dayaram has failed to co-operate in the administration of his estate; and
(b) the conduct of Dayaram in respect of the period before and after the commencement of the bankruptcy has been unsatisfactory.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES
9.  Parties are represented by counsel at the hearing and they do not have great dispute as to the legal principles applicable in the
present case. I therefore take the liberty to repeat some of their submissions below for reference.
10.  The applicable legal principles for suspension of time to discharge from bankruptcy under section 30A(3) of the Ordinance are helpfully summarised in following authorities.
11.  In Re Hui Hing Kwok [1999] HKCFI 1878; [1999] 3 HKC 683, Le Pichon J (as she then was), having considered the purpose of sections 30A(1) and 30A(2) of the Ordinance as set out in the Law Reform Commission’s Report on Bankruptcy that led to their enactment, observed that:-

“Rehabilitation in the sense of enabling the bankrupt to resume a normal life in society is a key, if not the key, consideration.
It should only be delayed by a bankrupt’s own failings.”

12.  In Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang CACV 112 & 113 of 2014 (unreported) 30 July 2014, Yuen JA held that:-

“It is well-established that an application for suspension of discharge from bankruptcy should be considered in two stages:
(1) the court should first determine whether one or more of the grounds mentioned in s.30A(4) has been established; and if established,
(2) the court would then move on to consider whether or not, in the exercise of its discretion, a suspension of discharge should be
ordered,

- having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the acts complained of and the post-bankruptcy order
conduct of the bankrupt, and
- bearing in mind the two main objectives of this part of the [the Ordinance]:

(a) the rehabilitation of the bankrupt by allowing him to resume a normal commercial life, as well as
(b)  the public interest in ensuring that the return of the bankrupt to the commercial world would not carry with it an unacceptable
risk to persons who may be engaged in commercial relations with him, and in preserving commercial morality.”

13.  I am also told that it is useful to look at Yuen JA’s comments in Re Leung Yat Tung (the Bankrupt) (No 2) [2007] HKCA 230; [2007] 4 HKC 192 in relation to the failure in co-operation ground that:-

“As the courts have said, a bankrupt is not permitted to adopt a ‘catch me if you can’ approach. He cannot wait and see if the
trustee in bankruptcy manages to piece together the jigsaw of his financial affairs, and then when he is required to answer the trustee’s
questions, try to get away with revealing as little as he can according to the strict letter of the questions. Instead he should
pro-actively reveal the complete picture of his financial affairs to the trustee, and where pieces do not appear to fit, in that
his conduct or transactions appear to be inconsistent, it is for him to explain the inconsistencies and convince the trustee of the
true state of affairs.”;

14.  Mr McLeish, counsel for Dayaram, specifically drew my attention to the reasons given by Yuen JA in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra), in relation to bankrupt’s unsatisfactory conduct, that:-

“7. …… It is now clear that suspension may be ordered only if the pre-bankruptcy order conduct was grave but it need not be
“exceptionally grave”: Tang Kai Mo v Fred Lee  [2008] HKCA 381; [2009] 1 HKLRD 87 , paras. 30-32.”
“8. As to what is meant by “unsatisfactory” pre-bankruptcy conduct, it was held in Lau Chi Kam [Fred Lee v Lau Chi Kam  [2008] HKCA 148; [2008] 3 HKLRD 627 ] (para 10) that the test for determining whether pre-bankruptcy order conduct was unsatisfactory was whether society would be prepared
to condone such conduct without any expression of disapproval. ……”

15.  Mr McLeish also submitted that for appropriate period of suspension of time to discharge from bankruptcy, Yuen JA held in Re Leung Yat Tung (supra) when overturning an order for suspension of the maximum period of four years:-

“In my view, that maximum period should be reserved for the most egregious cases. Whilst the bankrupt was not cooperative in substance,
he at least remained in communication with the OR …”

16.  He also relied on a passage from Totterdell v Nelson [1990] FCA 434;  (1990) 97 ALR 341 (cited by Le Pichon J (as she then was) in Re Li Tat Kong [2000] HKCFI 2116; [2000] 3 HKC 360), in which Burchett J observed that:-

“There may be cases where it would be unfair to a bankrupt to delay his discharge by reason of an incomplete investigation, lethargically
pursued, to the torpor of which he has not contributed.”

DISCUSSION
17.  Mr Lok, counsel for the Trustees, in support of the application, asked me to look at 4 particular incidents, namely:-

(a) Non-disclosure of claim against Days International HK;
(b) Non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Limited (incorporated in Liberia) (“Days Impex Liberia”) and Days Impex Limited
(incorporated in Hong Kong) (“Days Impex HK”) (both in compulsory liquidation); and
(c) Dissipation of shareholdings in some related companies to associated parties; and
(d) Dissipation of contributions from Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) Scheme.

Non-disclosure of Claim against Days International HK
18.  First of all, the Trustees relied on the non-disclosure of the Dayaram’s claim against Days International HK, a company incorporated
in Hong Kong which is currently in liquidation under HCCW 299 of 2011. Mr Lok submitted that Dayaram only mentioned about the claim
on 27 December 2013 when prompted by the Trustees on 23 December 2013 and the claim was not stated in the Statement of Affairs filed
by Dayaram dated 15 July 2013. The claim was in the sum of HK$4,744,239.20 and was not disclosed prior to this request. Mr Lok submitted
that Dayaram has remained largely unhelpful in relation to the Trustee’s investigation. The paucity of information provided is
unacceptable and this is particularly so given that Dayaram was a director and shareholder of Days International HK.
19.  Dayaram explained that provisional liquidators were appointed for Days International HK by the court on 14 September 2011. The provisional
liquidators seized all company assets and documents. He said that he was excluded from the company’s premises save that he was
permitted to collect personal items and effects. Furthermore, at the creditors’ meeting held on 18 January 2012, Dayaram’s claim
of HK$4,744,239.20 was reduced to HK$1 for voting purposes.
20.  Dayaram further explained that the reason he did not initially inform the Trustees of this claim was because the claim had already
been rejected and he did not consider that there was any realistic prospect of recovery in any event.
21.  Mr McLeish argued that there might be some substance to the Trustee’s allegation if there was any basis for suggesting that Dayaram
could possibly have believed that the claim could result in a payment to him given what had occurred. But he submitted that there
was none. Dayaram was misguided in initially omitting to mention the claim, but realistically he had nothing to gain from this so
as to permit bad faith to be imputed to him. In his submissions, Dayaram’s omission did not cause prejudice to the Trustees’
administration.
it is not sufficient for a bankrupt to take a purely passive role. In discharge of his duty, Dayaram needed to take all reasonable
steps to enable the Trustees to obtain all relevant information and understand his affairs promptly, but obviously he was in breach
of this positive duty. It is not a matter for Dayaram to decide what should be investigated by the Trustees. I also notice that Dayaram
was the director and shareholder of a number of companies.  He is a sophisticated businessman with ample experience in the commercial
world and therefore he knows far better than anyone else the importance of the disclosure at an early stage. All in all, I agree
with the Trustees that this amounts to failure to co-operate in administration of the estate.
Non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK
23.  Now, I turn to another incident relied on by the Trustees, namely the non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Liberia who,
in turn, was the controlling shareholder of Days Impex HK.
24.  Dayaram explained that he ceased to be the sole shareholder of Days Impex Liberia, and hence ceased to have any interest in Days
Impex HK several months before the bankruptcy order. He said that “the ownership of Liberian companies is by way of bearer shares” and explained how he somehow came to lose his shareholding because of debts owed to a “friend” (who lent him US$250,000) as a result of “high stakes baccarat” in Las Vegas in Christmas 2010. As a result, he later “ceased to own any shares in Days Impex Liberia several months before [he] was declared bankrupt”, namely “about the end of 2012”.
25.  Mr McLeish submitted that as at the time Dayaram completed the Statement of Affairs, Mr Dayaram had no shareholding in Days Impex
Liberia or interest in Days Impex HK. Accordingly, there was no omission as alleged by the Trustees and the complaint of failure
to co-operate under this heading is not made out.
26.  I agree that the mere failure to mention the shareholding in Days Impex Liberia in the Statement of Affairs is not sufficient to
establish that Dayaram was in breach of the duty to co-operate as I accept that at the material time he was no longer the shareholder.
But the Trustees’ complaint went far deeper than that. There is no dispute that, even up to the present moment, Dayaram refused
to provide any information on this “friend” who was the lender and later kept the “bearer shares” of Days Impex Liberia. Dayaram said in his affirmation dated 21 July 2017 that “I am unable to disclose the identity of the person to whom I gave the shares as this would cause considerable difficulties with
his family”. Furthermore, there is also no record whatsoever, contemporaneous or otherwise, to support any of his bare allegations in the entire
incident. Furthermore, Dayaram actually had been a director of Days Impex Liberia for the period 5 years preceding the bankruptcy
petition until 1 June 2013 but no document has ever been provided to prove the resignation.
27.  I agree with Mr Lok’s submissions that although the Trustees have not had a lot of evidence to say that there must be some questionable
or highly problematic transactions yet, in my view, Dayaram had a positive duty to provide the information and evidence for investigation.
 The major problem is that he refused to provide the assistance that the Trustees was entitled to have.
28.  Furthermore, because there was no mention whatsoever by Dayaram of the shareholdings of Days Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK at
all until the present application, the Trustees were unable to carry out their investigation. The information requested was definitely
useful to the Trustees. It would be quite wrong to say now that there might not be much use to look at the shareholdings of Days
Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK as they could be worthless. If bankrupts generally were allowed to delay, or even to refuse, to provide
useful information like this, administration of estate of bankrupts would become an almost impossible mission. I find that this deliberate
act of withholding useful information is a very serious breach of a bankrupt’s duty of co-operation in the administration of his
estate.
Dissipation of Shareholdings in the Related Companies to Associated Parties
29.  I am told that the Trustees were concerned as to the circumstances in which Dayaram transferred his shares in 3 different Hong Kong
companies, namely Days Cyberport Limited (“Days Cyberport”), Malkita Limited and Days Travel Service Limited (“Days Travel
Service”) (collectively the “Related Companies”) shortly after the filing of the bankruptcy petition on 7 December 2011.
30.  According to the Trustees, Dayaram executed a number of share transfers of his shares in the Related Companies on 21 February 2012,
as a result of which each of the transferees became the sole member of the Related Companies. The transferee of the shares in Days
Travel Service and Malkita Limited was Dayaram’s wife, Sheila Dayaram, who further transferred the shares in November 2012 to their
son, Mahesh Dayaram. The transferee of the share in Days Cyberport was Days International Limited, a company incorporated in British
Virgin Islands (“BVI”), of which Dayaram was a director (and was once a shareholder until 2005 or 2006). Dayaram explained to
the Trustees on 11 September 2013 that he was, in fact, holding shares on trust for the respective transferees of the Related Companies
but was unable, upon repeated requests, to produce any relevant information so as to substantiate the explanation being advanced
until almost 2 years later.
31.  Dayaram explained that in fact, he informed the Trustees about these transfers in his first response to their questions following
their appointment in his letter to the Trustees dated 11 September 2013. He said that he was holding the shares on trust for the
transferees who had requested him to transfer the shares to them. I am told that there was no consideration for these transfers.
He also said that he sent copies of the relevant declarations of trust and transfer requests to the Trustees by post almost 2 years
later on 5 August 2015. However, the Trustees, in reply, said that “they have not received copies of the Declarations of Trust and Transfer Request as alleged.”
32.  Besides giving the explanation above, Dayaram further said that, at the time of the transfers, the companies were all dormant and
none of them had any assets. It was therefore submitted on his behalf that even if Dayaram had had any beneficial interest in the
shares concerned, the transfer would be of nominal value and therefore would not constitute any unsatisfactory conduct.
33.  First of all, even accepting the fact that the relevant declarations of trust and transfer requests were sent by Dayaram to the
Trustees by post on 5 August 2015, I agree with the Trustees that it is highly suspicious to take almost 2 years to come up with
these documents.  I do not accept his explanation for the delay.
34.  Secondly, Dayaram never took the effort to ensure the Trustees received the documents. They were only recently disclosed in the
present application. In my view, this alone amount to failure to co-operate in administration. And I also agree with the Trustees
that “Had the Bankrupt provided the said documents also by e-mail (as per one of his usual modes of communication with the Trustees)
the Bankrupt would have at least be able to provide electronic record of the same”. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support that he “sent copies of these documents to the Trustees by post on 5 August 2015, with a covering letter”.  It is not in dispute that the duty is on the bankrupt to make full and frank disclosure and to proffer all pertinent information. Obviously, Dayaram, as a bankrupt, has failed to do so.
35.  Thirdly, the complaint against Dayaram was indeed about the suspicious transfer of the shares to some associated parties, namely
his wife, his son and a company incorporated in BVI with Dayaram as a director. According to him, although he was no longer the shareholder
of this BVI company at the time of transfer, he never explained who then became the shareholder or who was the beneficial owner of
this company since 2005 or 2006 and the reasons behind all these changes of shareholdings. Although it might be argued that if the
value of transfer was nominal, it might not constitute an unsatisfactory conduct, this is definitely not an answer to his conduct
in failing on his part to co-operate in providing essential information to the Trustees for investigation.
Dissipation of Contributions from MPF Scheme
36.  The Trustees also submitted that Dayaram failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for the spending of HK$1,320,478.04 maintained
at HSBC Life (International) Limited (“HSBC Life”) on or about 25 March 2013, namely after his bankruptcy petition was filed
and around 2 months prior to his Bankruptcy Order was made.
37.  Dayaram admitted that he had withdrawn his entire MPF contributions in March and April 2013. In the letter dated 27 September 2013,
the Trustees requested for transfer of the money to the estate as the MPF contributions vested in the Trustees. Initially, on 12
October 2013, in response to the Trustees’ request, he explained that the funds withdrawn “was already spent before the end of May, 2013.  There is no money remaining in my possession to refund to you”. More than 8 months later, on 30 June 2014, Dayaram purported to explain that the funds had been exhausted as a result of “donations in the dropboxes of Temples”, “cash handouts to poor people living in Government Housing Estates with particular emphasis on elderly and handicapped” and “food handouts to homeless living under flyovers with cash handouts as well”.  As a result, he “fully exhausted HK$1.08 million in the 9 weeks of charity”. There is no information whatsoever other than his bare assertions and there is no way to confirm the truth of the matter.
38.  My special attention was drawn to the initial answer given by Dayaram that the purpose of spending the contribution was not provided.
Later, Dayaram decided to explain and said that he spent the MPF contributions on charity. He then gave a detailed account on how
he made the donations to different parties. As a result, he “fully exhausted HK$1.08 million in the 9 weeks of charity” “plus travelling expenses of approximately 30K” and “there are no receipts for donations”.
39.  Mr McLeish submitted that given the charitable character of the dissipation of the MPF contributions, the test for determining whether
pre-bankruptcy conduct was unsatisfactory is clearly not met. He argued that society would be prepared to condone such conduct without
any expression of disapproval.
40.  With the greatest respect, I do not agree. It is wholly unacceptable and irresponsible for a businessman who donated his assets
for charity when he knew too well that he was insolvent. After the bankruptcy petition was filed and served, Dayaram must have been
aware of the huge liability he had to meet. I am sure that any responsible businessman would not have spent funds like that in a
manner similar to what Dayaram had done. In my view, no one would be prepared to condone Dayaram’s conduct without any expression
of disapproval. Applying the test in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra), this is no doubt an unsatisfactory conduct and I therefore find that the pre-bankruptcy conduct of Dayaram has been unsatisfactory.
In addition, I also find that the initial answer given by Dayaram is an obvious failure in co-operation.
Sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance
41.  All in all, I agree with Mr Lok that Dayaram’s conduct has been unsatisfactory and he has clearly failed to co-operate with the
Trustees.  It appears to me that none of the conduct was relating to poor judgment or misfortune. The 2 grounds as provided for in
sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance respectively have been established.
The Exercise of Discretion
42.  In exercise of my discretion, I bear in mind the 2 main objectives for the Ordinance set out in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra) for suspension of automatic discharge from bankruptcy. Again, I do not intend to repeat the facts as they are usefully summarised
in the counsel’s submissions. I shall just give my reasons and decision on this matter.
43.  First of all, I was invited to take into account the way that Dayaram arranged his affairs prior to his bankruptcy, which had a
direct bearing on the way that his bankruptcy could be administered. For instance, Dayaram would acquire properties, in his own name,
and then arrange for another corporate entity to take up the actual purchase. Complicated corporate structures were created for carrying
on business or for holding investment including stock and shares or real property for Dayaram and his family. In my view, this made
the work of the Trustees particularly difficult, unless Dayaram was upmost co-operative but unfortunately he was not.
44.  Secondly, I agree with the submissions of the Trustees that there are strong indications to suggest that the arrangements of Dayaram’s
affairs, including the imposition of complicated trust arrangements and corporate structures, could have effectively concealed his
relationship with a group of companies (holding a number of properties in Hong Kong) which on the face of it belonging to his family.
I agree that Dayaram has clearly failed from being full and frank in his disclosure. For this, the Trustees will have to continue
with the investigation because the administration has not been completed. In my view, the attitude adopted by Dayaram is far from
satisfactory and co-operative. Trustees would need more time to investigate to complete a meaningful administration.
45.  Thirdly, I also take into account the serious commercial fraud that Dayaram was involved.
46.  Fourthly, it is quite apparent that Dayaram largely chose to be passive and reactive.  He adopted the “catch me if you can”
approach and only provided information when he was caught and cornered by the Trustees.  And very often, he was unable to provide
documentary evidence to support his explanation.
47.  Fifthly, I agree with Mr Lok that there was no undue delay in administration on the part of the Trustees.
48.  However, when exercise my discretion, I do notice one thing which is in favour of Dayaram. I agree with Mr McLeish that, so far,
the results and the evidence coming out from the investigation of the 4 incidents, relied upon by the Trustees for making this application,
did not seem to show Dayaram did actually conceal any assets, although his unco-operative attitude gave a very strong impression
that he did. I also agree that the maximum period should be reserved for the most egregious cases and I am afraid that this is, although
a very serious one, not one of the most egregious. I therefore do not intend to impose the maximum period of suspension of 4 years.
49.  Given all the circumstances of the present case, I order that the relevant period shall cease to run for a period of 3 years.
50.  I was specifically asked to reserve the decision on costs and so I order.
DISPOSITION
51.  I will make the following orders:-

(a) The discharge of the bankruptcy under section 30A of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap. 6) shall cease to run for a period of 3 years from 12 June 2017; and
(b) Costs be reserved.

52.  Finally, I thank both counsel for their very helpful assistance.

KWOK YU WON ERIC v. TIM FUNG STEAM LAUNDRY (SHATIN) CO LTD [2018] HKCFI 2566; HCA 1923/2017 (20 November 2018),"4.  No reasons from the judge are required for summary assessment of costs. The allowance would be apparent from the breakdown of costs
and the objections made. 5.  Even if I, or more pertinently the Court of Appeal, should disagree that the costs should be for the sum of $470,000, but for a
lesser amount, I cannot see that the amount likely to be reduced on the assessment by the Court of Appeal, to reflect the necessary,
proper, proportionate and reasonable costs of the action, would “fall outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement
is possible”. 6.  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed, with costs to the Plaintiff, to be summarily assessed. The Plaintiff is to serve
its breakdown of costs on the Defendant within 3 days, and the Defendant is to serve and file its objections, if any, within 7 days.","TIM FUNG STEAM LAUNDRY (SHATIN) COMPANY LIMITED

failure to comply with it was the result of genuine extraneous circumstances such that the failure to obey is not contumelious. 33.  In the exercise of my discretion I must have regard to the interest of justice and whilst I accept this cuts both ways I think that
to exclude the defendant’s right to be heard on the Order 14 application outweighs the failure strictly to comply with the terms
of the Unless Order given the facts which have been established.  In reaching this conclusion I am conscious of the fact that the
parties are agreed that, by allowing this evidence to be filed and the plaintiff an appropriate right of reply, there will be no
prejudice to the hearing date which is set for January 2019. 34.  Accordingly in the exercise of my discretion I grant the defendant’s application for relief from the strict requirements to comply

minors had reached full age of 26 and 30 respectively.  Then on 4 November 1975, Mr. Wan Yau-po, by a deed of gift, assigned all
his interest in Lot Nos 526 and 527 to Mr. Wan Man. Subsequently, by an assignment dated 25 August 2011, Wan Man, in consideration
of HK$300,000, sold the properties, namely Lot Nos 526 and 527, to Wan Yau-loi (温有來), Wan Loi-hei (温來喜), Wan Kam-hung
(温錦洪), Wan Siu-wan Lauren (温笑雲), Wan Kam-kwong Raymond (温錦光) and Wan Kam-ming (温錦明) the applicants in the

from the title documents that I have seen, have acquired the title and interests in the said two properties in accordance with the

to pass over and use Land A as Lee’s licensees. 49.  For all the above reasons, I allow the Plaintiff’s claims to possession of Land X2, Land Y, and Land Z (claims to Land Z were
abandoned by the Yau Family at trial), but allow the Counterclaim of Lee, Yau Senior and Yau Junior to the extent of their claim
of adverse possession of Land X1.  I also allow Lee’s Counterclaim to an easement and a right of way over Land A, for herself,

HKSAR v. JOHIR MOHAMMED [2018] HKCFI 2526; HCMA 224/2018 (22 November 2018),"14.  I have sympathy for people who need to escape from their homeland for various reasons (political, religious or otherwise) to seek
refuge in a foreign territory.  Hong Kong owes those people nothing but has generously extended its hospitality to them.  The bottom
line is they need to behave themselves and obey the law here.  This is certainly not one bit too much to ask for and is the least
those people could do in return for the protection offered to them by Hong Kong. 15.  Ms Chit for the respondent has fairly drawn my attention to the issue of deduction for administrative detention[4].  The appellant was under administrative detention for a period of 36 days in early 2014 when he illegally entered Hong Kong.  In
other words, the administrative detention took place 4 years prior to the present offence. Furthermore, thedetention was unrelated
to the present offence.  As such, it does not trigger the operation of section 67A(1A) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221)[5].  The issue of administrative detention was not raised by the appellant's trial counsel during mitigation either.  I simply see no
reason why I should exercise my discretion to reduce the appellant's sentence for the administrative detention. 16.  This appeal has no merits and must be dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

"HONGFAN INTERNATIONAL LTD v. HONG KONG YAHE CO., LTD [2018] HKCFI 2565; HCMP 1633/2017 (22 November 2018)","67.  Secondly, as for material non-disclosure to a party which led to Yahe giving an undertaking, Yahe’s position is very different
from that of the ex parte judge.  Hongfan owes the court the duty of full and frank disclosure, but owes no such duty to Yahe.  Yahe has to look after its
own interest.  It has knowledge of the material facts.  It should know its case.  Yahe was given, by consent, eight days to consider
its position, take legal advice and do whatever it thought fit. If in those eight days Yahe discovered any fact which had not been
disclosed to the ex parte judge and which it thought relevant and would provide a ground for opposing the injunction sought, it is for Yahe to employ the information
to challenge Hongfan’s application at the subsequent hearing.  That was how Yahe could have used the information.  It was not permissible
for Yahe to raise material non-disclosure as a ground for seeking to be released from its undertaking.  For this reason, I do not
find it necessary to determine whether the non-disclosure was material from point of view of the ex partejudge.  The application for this relief has no merit and has to be dismissed. 68.  As for Yahe’s application for fortification, it is relevant if the interim injunction is to continue.  As Hongfan’s application
for injunctionis now dismissed, this application is academic and must also be dismissed. 69.  There is absolutely no merit in Yahe’s Discharge Summons.  Yahe was being over-litigious.  It unnecessarily raised issues which
complicated and delayed the whole matter.  The reliefs sought are misconceived and refused.  Accordingly, the summons is dismissed
with a costs order nisi that Yahe shall pay Hongfan’s costs, including all costs reserved.","HONG KONG YAHE CO., LIMITED

The outcome of the trial plainly justified the application for the interim Mareva injunction. Costs of the Mareva injunction should follow the cause.  The Mareva injunction was ordered before the sanctioned offer was made and so costs should be on party and party basis. 26.  I ordered that costs of both summonses be to the plaintiff to be taxed on indemnity basis, at the enhanced interest rate until full

judge was nevertheless entitled to find that Top Catering has failed to discharge its burden of proving the quantum.  His finding
that it would be wrong in principle and artificial to nevertheless allow the amount claimed as if it were a notional sum, in my view,
cannot be faulted. 38.  Top Catering’s application for extension of time to appeal is refused. Following such event, Tasty should have her costs of and

GREENS NURSERY &AMP; TREE PLANTING DESIGN LTD v. SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE [2018] HKCFI 2558; HCA 1286/2015 (23 November 2018),"123.  By reason of the above, I answer Issue #4(ii) also in the negative. 124.  Given my findings above, there is no need for me to consider the issue of quantum.  In all cases, the issue of quantum is directly
linked to the nature and extent of breach(es) that the infringing party is found to have committed.  I do not want to consider quantum
on any hypothetical basis.  It is particularly so in the present case where the plaintiff has raised a number of different causes
of action on different bases.  I add only this, that there are a lot of merits in Mr Leung’s submissions to the following effects.
 The evidence given by Mr Wan on the issue of quantum has three major problems: (1) why the plaintiff said the Premises could be
demarcated into 1,000 car‑parking spaces; (2) the monthly rental of each car-parking space, and (3) the failure on its part to
deal with the operating expenses.  I note that the plaintiff has called no expert evidence in those regards.  I see therefore some
merits in Mr Leung’s submission, based on McGregor on Damages, 20thed (2018), paragraph 10-001, that the plaintiff has failed to prove its loss, and that its claim may be dismissed on this basis alone.
 There is however some evidence which suggests that the defendant might have suffered a small loss (in the sum of HK$10,600, being
alleged expenses in engaging contractors for excavation works at the Premises).  The parties also did not address me on the possibility
of nominal damages.  On that basis, and given my earlier conclusions, I decide to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim on its failure
to establish those framed issues on liability.  I make no findings on the issue on quantum before what I have discussed in this paragraph.
 125.  For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.  I make a costs order nisi that the defendant shall have the costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed.

HAMMER CAPITAL PRIVATE INVESTMENTS LTD v. INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA (ASIA) LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2603; HCMP 2046/2018 (23 November 2018),"9.  As earlier mentioned, in the course of her reply submissions, Ms Chan sought a revised form of injunction, namely, that the 1st and 2nd Defendants be restrained from proceeding with the public auction of the Mortgaged Properties (i) on 26 November 2018 or (ii) earlier
than 10 December 2018 unless (a) the completion date is at least 10 weeks from the date of the auction, or (b) it is with the prior
written consent of the Plaintiff, or (c) it is sanctioned by an order of the court.  It appears that the focus of the complaint under
this revised formulation of the injunction is now shifted to the completion date.  However, it remains the case that, if the Mortgaged
Properties will not be sold for less than their market values, there cannot, in my view, be any real objection to the proposed auction
taking place on next Monday or on any other date.  I do not therefore consider that the revised formulation of the injunction meets
the substance of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ objection to the application. 10.  In all, I am not minded to grant the interim injunction sought by the Plaintiff.  Depending on the result of the auction, there
may or may not be any useful purpose for the Plaintiff to further pursue the summons.  I do not therefore propose to give any directions

not find them to be directly relevant to exercise of my discretion whether or not to grant leave to amend.  Even if marginally relevant,
they have not impacted on the exercise of my discretion in this matter.  However, insofar as they may affect the merits of the substantive
application, I do not preclude the parties from repeating those submissions, or some of them, at the hearing before me on 23 January

their improper conduct, the respondents can be deprived of their costs of the proceedings before the Magistrate.  24.  However, insofar as the appeal is concerned, the respondents being the successful parties should normally have their costs unless
there is special reason not to follow the usual rule.  While counsel for the respondents rendered little assistance in the issue

such that the respondents should be penalized by costs.  Indeed, the appeal would have been dismissed even if the issue raised by

the Yau Tong Property, there will be a conflict of interest on the part of Harbour Front as a director of Fonfair as well as a potential
purchaser; and with grant of the prohibitive injunction the Court would effectively sanction theconflict of interest.  I disagree.
 First, the articles of association expressly allow a director to deal with the company after appropriate declaration of interest.
 Second, which is more important, Harbour Front has not yet proved its case in these proceedings, and as explained above, at this
interlocutory stage the Court will not grant any substantive right to Harbour Front to participate in the management of the company’s
affairs including obtaining internal information of any potential sale to Harbour Front’s advantage. 53.  In conclusion, for the above reasons, I am prepared to grant the interlocutory relief restraining sale or disposal of the Yau Tong
Property (unless with Harbour Front’s prior approval or consent) pending determination of the Petition or further order of the

no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim against her as a partner of the Firm, on the basis of the 1st Facility Letter signed by the 1st Defendant - Wong’s partner at the material time of the loan.  It is not disputed by Wong that she signed the account opening form
with the Plaintiff, purporting to be a partner of the Firm, and that she was held out to the Plaintiff, and to the world at large,
as a partner of the Firm.  The 1st Defendant, as partner, would have the usual authority to sign documents on her behalf for the Firm.  Wong’s assertion that as a
non-equity partner, it was understood and agreed between the 1st Defendant and herself that she would not be liable for the debts and liabilities of the Firm, as she was not responsible for the
profits and losses of the Firm, is no answer to the claim made by the Plaintiff, a third-party dealing with the Firm and to whom
Wong was held out (with her consent) to be a partner.  At most, Wong would be entitled to seek indemnity from the 1st Defendant.  23.  The Statement of Claim pleads (paragraph 1 (b)) that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were trading as the Firm. It makes it clear that the loans were made to, received and utilised by the Firm pursuant to
the Facility Letters.  Wong disputes her signatures on the documents relied upon by the Plaintiff in her evidence filed in support
of her application to set aside the Judgment, but if, after considering the merits of the Plaintiff’s case, Wong has no real defence
to the claims made against her as a partner for the debts of the Firm, there is no point to the setting aside, and no injustice in
the exercise of the discretion of the Court, not to set aside the regular judgment.  24.  For these reasons, the appeal against the Master’s refusal to set aside the Judgment is dismissed, with costs to the Plaintiff,
summarily assessed at $125,000. ","Date of Decision:

of last resort to wind‑up the Company when it is in doubt over the Petitioner entitlement to the Debt.  I should add that the failure
to join Lau in these circumstances tends to lend weight to Ling’s contention that the evidence adduced by the Petitioner does not

YUNG SIU WA v. RAFFLES FAMILY OFFICE LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2620; HCMP 1900/2018 (27 November 2018),"43.  Mr Lai submits that there should be no order as to costs becauseof the stance of the defendants on 30 October 2018 (agreeing to
provide the documents but in 42 days’ time) it was reasonable for the plaintiff to take out the Originating Summons, and he also
refers to the lateness of the allegations made by Kwan and Mok.  However, a necessary conclusion from my analysis above is that the
improper purpose existed when the Originating Summons was issued on 30 October 2018.  Thus the making of this application is not
justified.  I therefore see no reason that costs should not follow the event.  I order that the plaintiff is to pay the costs of
the defendants of this Originating Summons, including the costs of the hearings on 13 and 23 November 2018.  In so far as necessary
and for the avoidance of doubt, I give certificate for counsel for both hearings. 44.  After I have finished writing these reasons, I received a letter dated 26 November 2018 from OLN making further submissions and
referring to new evidence.  I have considered all the points made and have revised my reasons accordingly to deal with them in so
far as it is necessary, on the assumption (without accepting or finding) that the necessary factual allegations stated therein are true.  Since my decision remains the same,
I do not see the need to ask the defendants to respond but since I have not done so I repeat that I only assume those allegations to be true.  If any such matters become relevant in any future proceedings, this judgment should not be regarded
as containing any findings or conclusions on the factual allegations in the said letter of 26 November 2018. 45.  I thank counsel for their assistance.","RAFFLES MANAGEMENT (HK)

of the same date he explained that he did not receive any letter from the Court and hence was not aware of the decision until he
was detained by the Immigration Department when he was told of the decision and was thereforeunable to lodge his appeal until now,
but at the hearing of his summons before me he clarified that as he was not aware of the rule and that his friends did not give him
proper advice which accounted for the delay.  Given these seemingly contradictory explanations, and that he was unable to explain
why the decision did not reach him at his last known reported address at the material time, I do not accept that he has provided
any valid explanation for such considerable delay. 5.  To decide whether there is good reason to extend time it would be relevant to consider the prospect of his intended appeal by referring
to his proposed grounds of appeal, of which he however did not provide any despite his claim in his affirmation that he has good
grounds,and in the absence of any particulars as to any error in the decision or why it was unreasonable or unfair, I am unable to
see any prospect of success in his intended appeal. 6.  In the premises it would be futile to extend time for what appears to me a hopeless appeal.  Accordingly I refuse his application

GREATER CHINA APPRAISAL LTD v. TSANG KANG PO AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2552; HCA 1849/2018 (29 November 2018),"86.  In reaching the conclusion I have had regard to the admitted delay of nine weeks in bringing the application and the coincidence
of the timing of their launch but I accept the plaintiff’s need to have carried out some further investigations into the parties’
respective roles before it couldlaunch proceedings and in these circumstances I do not think the delay here is disproportionately
long such that it should be the predominant factor in reaching my decision. 87.  Accordingly I have concluded that there is a serious issue to be tried and that whilst damages might be an adequate remedy in relation
to the alleged claim in relation to the Hung Hing Project, which is now complete, that is not the case in relation to any existing
or future breaches of confidentiality by the defendants.  Accordingly I think that the balance of convenience favours the grant of
the restraining injunction to the extent I have indicated but not the springboard injunction. 88.  In all of the circumstances I make an order nisi that the costs be in the cause. ","D3

save for the disappointment that the litigation would continue. 99.  Mr Chang did not address any of the above matters in his written/oral submissions. That being the case, it suffices for me to say
that having carefully considered the above matters, I find Felix’s default excusable and there was nothing that detracted from
my conclusion that the Judgment should be set aside. I accept the main consideration remained the merits of Felix’s case, but in
light of the above discussions I am of the view that if Felix’s allegations were established at trial (and there clearly was a
realistic prospect of this happening), they would be capable of giving rise to an equity under the estoppels that would enable the
court to grant relief (whether a life interest or less) upon its balancing exercise. At this interlocutory stage, there was nothing
inherently incredible about Felix’s case in the context of how the involved parties conducted the family affairs, which might also
explain the paucity of documentary evidence, and the thin rebuttal in the Jonathan Aff to Felix’s assertions. 100.  In the circumstances, the Appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order

                in respect of Felix’s claim that he had taken back custody of the Children in reliance of having a residence at

failed and she thereafter asked Felix to take the Children) and unrelated to the Property and/or Assurances, and it would be incredible
to suggest Felix would have left the Children without care had the Property been unavailable, and nonsensical to suggest caring for

Finally in relation to P’s case that Xu had apparent authority I accept the finding of the Court of Final Appeal in Akai Holdings Ltd (No 2) that it is practically inconceivable to see how an agent without actual authority could cloth himself with apparent authority
by his own representation.  The fact of Xu’s appointment as co-Chairman and Executive Director of D, confer no actual authority
(whether express or implied) on Xu to enter into the agreement for the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement because of their peculiar
and unusual nature.  For the same reason such appointment (without more) cannot be a representation of Xu’s apparent authority
for agreeing to the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement in the circumstances of this case. 56.  The Court of Final Appeal in Akai Holdings Ltd (No 2) further held that any reliance on the apparent authority of an agent could not be “dishonest or unnatural (which includes turning
a blind eye and being reckless)”.  The peculiarity of the Promised Acts and the 2011 Agreement strongly demonstrate that P’s
purported reliance on the apparent authority of Xu was at least irrational or reckless for the following reasons: 57.

For the foregoing reasons, I accept that the 4th Defendant’s Proposed Order is a more appropriate order than the Plaintiff’s Proposed Order.  The Plaintiff’s submission that
the 4th Defendant’s Proposed Orderin effect binds the Plaintiff to a Bullock order is largely a red herring.  There is no merit in such submission. 27.

Costs are in the discretion of the Court (see section 52A of the High Court Ordinance, Cap 4 and Order 62, rule 2(4) of the Rules of the High Court).  Order 62, rule 5(1) deals with matters to be taken into account by the Court in exercising its discretion as to costs.  They include the underlying objectives
set out in Order 1A, rule 1; and whether a party has succeeded on part of his case.  In view of the above, I consider a fair exercise of the discretion is to
make no order on the costs of the application. 28.  I make the following orders on the application:","CHAN WAH TAT CARLMEN formerly trading as SUN SHING HING SHIPYARD

to P is sogreat that it seems to me just that the court should act to protect P’s positionpending trial.  The injunction sought
is of very limited application.  P hasconfirmed that it is prepared to erect a padlocked gate with fencing blocking any access to
D’s lot through the proposed opening if D requests this. 31.  I am conscious too in exercising my discretion in this way that throughout the period of the dispute and for many years before that
D’s lot has been deserted and in particular nothing has been stored or placed on the disputed land.  As a result it seems to me
that the injustice which will be caused to P if the injunction were to be refused far outweighs any inconvenience which would be
caused to D if the injunction is granted.  Whilst the delay in seeking the court’s assistance is a factor to be taken intoaccount,
I do not think that it should be the predominant factor in deciding whether or not it is just and fair to grant the injunction. 32.  I would only add that it is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an accommodation pending trial to avoid the
time and costs expended so far.  In the circumstances I make an order nisi for D’s costs in the cause.","LAND ZONE LIMITED (立崇有限公司)

"JAYJUN COSMETIC CO., LTD v. JAY JUN (KOREA COSMETIC LTD) [2018] HKCFI 2619; HCMP 161/2018 (30 November 2018)","9.  This, taken with the defendant’s complete lack of regard for the present court proceedings justified to my mind the plaintiff’s
applicationand I therefore summarily assessed the costs to be paid by the defendant on an indemnity basis. 10.  In ordering indemnity costs I took note of the defendant’s approach to his security for costs application, his disregard for the
Court in not even appearing on this application and the without prejudice correspondence put before the court after I had made the
order I have, which demonstrates to my mind a clear attempt on the defendant’s part to extract a punitive sum from the plaintiff
by way of compensation for his withdrawing his trademark which is the subject of the action; this seems to me to be evidence of a
base ulterior motive. 11.  If a party is sued and states an intention to defend it is disrespectful to the court simply to abandon any attempt to participate
in the proceedings such that the plaintiff is put to unnecessary costs and both court and judicial time is wasted.","JAY JUN (KOREA COSMETIC LIMITED)

For the foregoing reasons, I make the following orders on costs: 27.  In respect of the costs arising from the written submissions on costs, the Plaintiff and the Defendants have each succeeded in some
respect and failed in others.  Having taken into account the above and the underlying objectives set out in Order 1A, rule 1, I make
no order as to costs arising from the written submissions, instead of leaving them to form part of the costs of the action or the
relevant summons. 28.  For reference in taxation, about 50% of the hearing on 11 July 2018 was spent on the Plaintiff’s Summons, and the remaining 50%

DESIGNING HONG KONG LTD v. THE TOWN PLANNING BOARD [2018] HKCFI 2641; HCAL 49/2014 (30 November 2018),"30.  In the present case, given the very significant delay of some four years in the application coupled with the absence of any satisfactory
explanations for the delay, and the prejudice caused to good administration, I do not think the fact that this judicial review raises
questions of public importance alone would amount to such “good reason” to overbear these other factors in favour of granting
the joinder now. 31.  For all the above reasons, having taken into account all the relevant factors into consideration, Madam Ho has failed to satisfy
me that there is good reason for me to exercise the discretion to allow her to join as an applicant in this judicial review.[9] 32.  I would therefore dismiss her joinder application with costs to the TPB, to be taxed if not agreed, with certificate for two counsel.

The Registrar also drew my attention to section 42(8) of the Ordinance which provides that if the Court makes an order under section 42, the person who made the application must deliver an office copy of the order to the Registrar for registration.  Registration of
the order shows a complete picture of the matter, facilities the public in tracing and understanding the changes of information in
the Companies Register. 13.  On the basis of the evidence before me, there is no reason to question the allegations of the applicants.  It would appear that
they are victims of a fraudulent scheme and the information contained in the documents filed behind their backs are invalid and the
acts were committed without the Company’s authority.  The signatures of the applicants would appear to have been forged.  The continuing
presence of the information in the documents on the Companies Register will obviously cause material damage to the Company and the
Company’s interest in removing the information outweighs the interest of other persons in the information continuing to appear

 Matters such as D2’s year of birth, his career progression since 1977, and what happened to various Mainland Chinese corporations

the law must be borne in mind.  Relevant materials should be included, while irrelevant materials should be excluded.  Overloading
the Court with irrelevant facts simply does not assist.

out would be counterproductive as it would slow down the progress of the case and bring about adverse costs consequences.  Borrowing

brush approach, I will order that SHL pay Joytex 50% of its costs of the Variation Summons[10]. 36.  My orders are therefore as follows:","SUPER HOMES LIMITED

and the Supplemental Deeds are found at the trial to be unenforceable, this will affect the P’s claim against D2 and D3.  Further,
a default judgement against D2 and D3 may affect the issue of unenforceability raised by D1. 49.  Having considered the above, I am not prepared to give default judgment as claimed by P.  I am of the view that the application

misappropriated assets by the 1stDefendant for the benefit of the estate of the Deceased provided that there is no double recovery. 44.  I am also of the view that costs should be ordered against the 1st Defendant on an indemnity basis because she has basically committed a fraud against the estate of the Deceased and all her siblings.
Worse, the 1stDefendant wrongly dragged on this case and then chose not to appear in court to testify her case. 45.  Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Chong for his very able and helpful assistance rendered to this court.","(5)

WONG CHAK MING v. WONG YUEN WAN ALICE AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 77; HCMP 3395/2016 (10 December 2018),"30.  I, therefore, order P to pay costs of the 1st summons of D1 to D1 and D2’s summons to D2. 31.  Regarding D1’s 2nd summons, I think it is an abuse of process because I can see no purpose but mud throwing by saying that P was
not attending to what used to be something that he was very concerned and cared about.  This has nothing to do with the administration
of the estate and I order D1 to pay P indemnity costs on this summons. 32.  Regarding D1’s 3rd summons, part of it is consented to.  So I do not think P should pay costs for that part.  The other part was
opposed successfully and has been dismissed. So, I would order half of the costs of D1’s 3rd summons be in the cause and the remaining
half be paid by D1 to P on party and party basis.  I do not think that is an abuse, although irrelevant.  I, therefore, do not regard
the indemnity scale as appropriate.","WONG SAU LIN ESTELLA (黃秀蓮)

In terms of timing, I am not satisfied that it is appropriate to specify a time by which payment should be made.  I do not know

RE PROSPEROUS GLOBALCHINA HOLDING LTD [2018] HKCFI 2789; HCCW 279/2018 (10 December 2018),"4.  It appears to be Ms Li’s case that Dr Chen, who is considerably older than her, had, what I shall describe for want of a better
expression, a romantic interest in her which in the fullness of time, it became apparent she did not reciprocate.  As a result, by
December 2016, when the Company required further cash in order to continue its business, Dr Chen gave Ms Li two choices as to how
he was willing to provide the finance that she thought was required by the Company.  She says that during a business trip to Birmingham,
Dr Chen told her on 2 December 2016 that the choices were either she slept with him, in which case he was prepared to provide additional
finance in the form of capital, or if she did not wish to do so, he instead would lend money to the Company.  Ms Li chose the latter
and as a result, the GBP10 million was advanced, although, as is apparent from what I have said earlier in these reasons, the loan
agreement was back-dated to 23 June 2015.  5.  The argument of Mr Lam, who appeared on behalf of Ms Li, on precisely how these circumstances in some way restricted the petitioner’s
ability to require repayment of the loan was unclear.  However, it seems fairly clear from his submissions, and also the way in which
Ms Li’s case is put both in her affirmation filed in this petition and also the way her case is set out in her own petition when
it deals with the understandings between Dr Chen and herself which led to the formation of the Company, that neither the petitioner
nor Dr Chen was under any obligation to contribute further capital to the Company.  It seems to follow that in these circumstances
the suggestion, and this is what is said to constitute a bona fide defence on substantial grounds to the petition, that the loan was advanced under duress and this provides a defence is simply misconceived
and unsustainable.  6.  I will, therefore, make the normal winding-up order.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2789.html,"

HKSAR v. MA KA KIN [2018] HKCFI 2711; HCCC 312/2017 (11 December 2018),"34.  The second matter was the reason for amending the Summary of Facts to delete the name of Hung Chi-him and substituted that with
Ah Him.  According to DC, it was the applicant’s idea to change it.  The reason given by the applicant was that leaving Hung Chi-him
in the Summary of Facts would make him “look like a liar”.  According to the applicant, the suggestion came from PC and since
he had already decided to plead guilty, he did not care whether the full name of Hung Chi-him appeared or not. 35.  As the Summary of Facts only related what the applicant had said during the Video-recorded Interview, whether the name of Hung Chi-him or Ah Him appears, it still remains a fact that the applicant had
said someone else had asked him to collect the parcel.  Leaving the name of Hung Chi-him in the Summary of Facts would not make the
applicant any less a liar.  I accept the applicant’s version of the event.  Again, changing the full name of Hung Chi-him to Ah
Him is to the benefit of Hung Chi-him rather than to the applicant.  It makes no difference to the applicant’s case. 36.  On the evidence before me, I find that the applicant has succeeded in showing that his plea of guilty was entered involuntarily
and I grant his application to withdraw his plea of guilty.","MA KA KIN

PANCHANATHAN RAMU v. TORTURE CLAIMS APPEAL BOARD / NON-REFOULEMENT CLAIMS PETITION OFFICE [2018] HKCFI 2734; HCAL 793/2017 (12 December 2018),"7.  The applicant has now been in Hong Kong since 2013.  He has been interacting with various government agencies for the entirety of
that period and accepts he received all necessary documents and notifications at his original address, which is the one on file and
at which he had been staying since 2014.  In June of this year he moved addresses to an address in Yuen Long, which he says is his
official address and at which he resides.  However, he has now given the Court a different address for the purposes of service because
the post box in his own address is insecure.  He says that the second address is that of a friend.  This situation is unacceptable.
 All applicants have a duty to ensure that the Court can communicate with them effectively.  He had from June of this year to inform
the Court of his new address and did not do so.  The reason this application is late is to be put entirely at his own door.  He was
notified promptly of the decision of this Court and, had he been living at his registered address, he would have been made aware
of what was required of him should he wish to appeal that decision.  It was incumbent upon him to do so promptly.  He put himself
in a position where that could not happen. 8.  In any event, I have considered his underlying application.  It has no merit as explained in the initial refusal of leave.  There
were no grounds of review and there was no complaint before the Court as to the decision to refuse leave.  The applicant merely wishes
the Court of Appeal to consider his situation afresh.  I have explained to the applicant that is not the function of the Court in
judicial review proceedings.  He does not seem to want to take this point on board.  Having considered the length of delay, reason
for the delay and underlying merits of his application, it would not be in the interest of justice to grant an extension of time
in all the circumstances of this case. 9.  The applicant’s summons dated 23 October 2018 be dismissed with, no order as to costs.","Date of Ruling:

D asked for the costs of the Summons forthwith on the ground that (in D’s view) the Summons should never have been taken out.  I gave this option serious thought but decided against it.  In my view, bearing in
mind the presumption of consideration in law in relation to cheques, it was not wholly unreasonable for P to attempt summary judgment application in the manner as it did, even though I decided against P in the
end.  All things considered, I came to the view that the most appropriate costs order would be costs in the cause of the action and
I so order. 21.  On the question of Certificate for Counsel, in my judgment it was reasonable, necessary and proper for both P and D to engage Counsel
to argue the Summons substantively, as the presentation of the evidence in this matter and the submissions on the law both called
for the engagement of skillful advocates.  I granted Certificate for Counsel for the Summons accordingly. 22.  I thank both Counsel for their most able assistance.","Date of Decision:

Officer only considered that aspect of the case briefly in one paragraph at §50.  She has not elaborated on her detailed consideration.
 It is not apparent on the face of her Reasons that she has misdirected herself on law.  I am in any event not satisfied that this,
which was all but one small aspect of her overall consideration, might affect the conclusion that she ultimately reached. 24.  Once the above is disposed of, what are left with the Grounds are a barrage of what are in my view challenges of a factual nature
disguised as alleged failure on the Presiding Officer’s part to carry out her duty to investigate.  They concerned factual matters
like the commission-based arrangement between the applicant and the defendant, the defendant’sexplanation on the way certain Employer’s
Returns were filed with the InlandRevenue Department, the applicant’s attitude to superiors, her choice to turn down new cases,
her ability to negotiate her fees, etc.  Those were factual matters which the Presiding Officer considered in the context of the
criteria which she had identified.  I am not satisfied that it is arguable that the applicant has suffered any injustice, or that
a fair and proper determination of the claim has not been attained.  I am not satisfied that any of the other Grounds are arguable.

"STICHTING RIJSKMUSEUM TWENTHE v. HANG SENG BANK, LTD [2018] HKCFI 2831; HCMP 2152/2018 (14 December 2018)","4.  The first matter concerns the heading of the Originating Summons.  There is no need to make reference to section 42(1) of the High Court Ordinance and Order 24 rule 7A.  The jurisdiction of the power to grant Norwich Pharmacal relief is an inherent one.  But as no one has been
misled by the reference to that section and that rule, and this not being the appropriate case to argue over the strict applicability
of section 42(1) in an application of this sort, I make no formal amendment in those regards. 5.  In respect of the permitted use of the documents and information to be disclosed, I add the additional words of “except the disclosing
defendant” at the end of paragraph 3 of the draft order.  I say immediately that there is no evidence or suggestion at this stage
whatsoever that the defendant has done anything wrong.  But as a matter of principle and fairness, issue of right against self-incrimination
might be engaged if the documents and information to be disclosed were to be used against the disclosing bank.  That should be expressly
excepted at this stage. 6.  On the question of costs, it should be expressly made clear at paragraph 5 that the plaintiff do reimburse the defendant for the
costs and expenses in complying with the order in paragraphs 1 and 2 on an indemnity basis. ","Date of Decision:

HERAEUS LTD v. CHAN YUN MUI AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2721; HCA 878/2011 (17 December 2018),"123.  On the other hand, P’s concerns were real.[69] If the D2 and Amend Summonses as were acceded to now (ie 7 years after commencement of the present action), the parties would have
to return to basics to re-draw their pleadings and engage in interlocutory skirmishes (including further discovery and supplemental/further
witness statements on the business model / Practice and their actual operation as between SKL and P doing back decades, or even expert
accounting evidence[70]) before the present action could be set down for trial. Mr Fong seemed to have assumed P’s affirmation evidence filed for opposing
the D2 Summons would be the sum total of P’s resistance to the Violet Amendments (if allowed). I see no basis for such assumption
when P already alluded to the investigations that would be required. The fact P saw no need to condescend into a debate over the
business model / Practice for the purpose of resisting the D2 Summons would not preclude P from pleading its full array of reply
contentions if the Violet Amendments were allowed. Further, it must not be forgotten that D2 himself was still seeking discovery
from HSBC to fortify the averments in the Violet Amendments. In my view, the delay that was likely to arise would be considerable,
and could take up to a year if not longer (see also paragraphs 112-113 above). This was particularly worrying since (a) the parties
had been at the brink of trial being set down since December 2016, and (b) D2 had been assuring the court even earlier, ie since
2015, that his case was ready for trial. Although there was no trial date as yet, it was clear but for the D2 Summons/Appeal this
action could have been set down for trial upon completion of the D1 Appeal. In the circumstances, although no milestone date was
disturbed, “[in] substance and in effect, it is little different from disturbing a milestone date”.[71] It was plain that if relief was granted in favour of D2, P was bound to suffer procedural/forensic prejudice which could not be compensated
by costs or interest on the judgment debt even if P were to succeed at trial. I bear in mind that the Kupka Aff referred to P’s
non-retention of business documents after a period of 7 years. 124.  For all of the above reasons, the D2 Appeal must be dismissed. There be liberty for P to set the present action down for trial as
per the order of the Registrar dated 9 December 2016. I further direct that within 7 days from today P shall apply to the Listing Clerk
to restore its summons filed on 23 February 2018 for 3-minute hearing before master. But I hope both parties should see the sense
of dealing with such summons by consent in order to save time and costs. 125.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P costs of and occasioned by the D2 Appeal to be taxed forthwith on indemnity basis if not agreed.","1456058

In the normal course of events, the applicant had 14 days in which to apply to appeal that decision. He did not do so because the
Order had incorrectly indicated that his application had been allowed, whereas a reading of the Call-1 form would have made it clear
that was not the case. 2.  The error was only corrected on 1 November 2018 and thereafter should have been served upon the applicant. He is rightly aggrieved
at this apparent change of stance as he was entitled to believe that his application would proceed to a substantive review in due
course. Unfortunately, that is not the case. His application was refused and remains so. 3.  In the light of the above, the applicant has 14 days from today to file any application for leave to appeal the decision of this

TANG CHUEN CHUNG v. KATAL (INTERNATIONAL) KNITTING FACTORY LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2828; HCCW 242/2017 (17 December 2018),"24.  As will be apparent from my reasons, it seems to me that the way in which the Respondents have dealt with Mr Tang’s claims, and
his attempts to either have the Company wound up or alternatively have his own interests in it purchased, has been unsatisfactory.
 I would note that I have conducted the various case management conferences in these proceedings at which on a number of occasions
Mr Chain on behalf of Mr Tang has indicated a willingness to settle and outline a basis for progressing discussions.  These have
over time not been responded to constructively. It also in my view is unsatisfactory that despite the fact that well before trial
it is obvious that the Respondents had access to the relevant documents and, in the case of Ms Hui, somebody who could help explain
the ledgers, that the Respondents have continued to make serious allegations against Mr Tang without taking the trouble themselves
to understand the affairs of the Company and its accounts with a view to assessing fairly what the true position is, and how the
parties’ interests can fairly be resolved.  25.  As I have already indicated, it is far too common in the Companies Court for small shareholders disputes to be conducted in this
way, and for the disputes between owners of businesses which it should be possible to resolve relatively easily to be allowed to
deteriorate into rather childish squabbles, which serve no commercial purpose other than to incur legal costs which reduces the value
of the assets available to shareholders. 26.  I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to order that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents pay the Petitioner’s costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis.","AU GARY CHUNG LOK

LCYP v. JEK [2018] HKCFI 2738; HCMC 3/2018 (18 December 2018),"37.  It appears from Mr Dearle’s submissions that the Husband is going to challenge any expert’s evidence without even knowing what
assumptions or rates of inflations are going to be used by the expert. 38.  It is exactly to avoid unnecessary challenges and disputes, and to save costs, and indeed not to lengthen the trial, that one single
expert should be appointed.  Duxbury calculations are common in matrimonial finance cases and in my view should not be complex. 39.  Having considered the circumstances in this case, and as Mr Chow had pointed out, any costs would have to come out of family assets,
I am of the view that that it is in the interest of justice and the parties that one single joint expert is to be appointed for the
preparation of the Duxbury calculations.  For these reasons, I have allowed the Wife’s application at the hearing.  The parties
were then able to agree to directions for the appointment of the expert.  I have ordered the Wife’s costs to be paid by the Husband
within 7 days of summary assessment, the Wife to lodge her statement of costs within 7 days from the date of the hearing and the
Husband his list of objections within 7 days thereafter.  I also recorded that the time of hearing related to the SJE Summons to
be not more than 30 minutes.","JEK

ZHANG YAN YIN v. KORCHINA CULTURE INVESTMENT LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2764; HCA 30/2018 (18 December 2018),"30.  On 10 November 2017, the Court granted injunctions against the Son, Wang and SC (a company controlled by the Family) in HCA 2509
instituted by Gu and Korchina, whereby they were restrained from disposing of their interests and ownership in the assets of AF including
its shareholding in Alishan.  Korchina and Gu have undertaken to give notice to inform Zhang’s solicitors in writing within 48
hours of any change in respect of these injunctions.  There is no risk of further dissipation of or dealings in the shares in AF
or Alishan.  31.  For all the above reasons, I am not satisfied that Zhang has established any irreparable damage to justify the grant of an interim
injunction.  There is inordinate and unjustifiable delay in the application for injunction by the Summons issued in this action,
as set out in the preceding paragraphs of this Decision.  There is no satisfactory explanation as to why this action has to be instituted,
and why the claims made in this action cannot be pursued in the 2014 Action, which remains ongoing as against AF and Alishan.  Nor
is the injunction sought by Zhang in respect of dealings in the shares in AF and Alishan necessary, when court injunctions and cross-undertakings
are in place in HCA 2509, whereby the Family and Wang have been prohibited from dealing with the AF Shares and the Land.  32.  The Summons is accordingly dismissed, with costs to be paid by Zhang to the Defendants, with certificate for Counsel. ","Date of Reasons for Decision:

this petition, having taken into account the unusual features of the subject agreement and the arbitration award discussed above. 44.  The parties’ written submissions also mentioned various other points.  These have not been expressly set out or dealt with above.
 This is so only because of the need to balance between the length of the judgment and its easier comprehension.  It does not mean
those other points are thought to be irrelevant (or have been overlooked).  To avoid doubt, those other points have also been considered. 45.  There is no apparent reason to depart from the usual rule that costs should follow the event.  There will accordingly be a costs
order that the costs of this petition (including any reserved costs) be paid by the petitioner to Lee to be taxed if not agreed.
 However, contrary to Lee’s submissions, I do not consider this petition to justify the court attendance of more than one counsel.","Date of Judgment:

 HKSBC will not contest the application and will abide by any decision of the court.  BOCHK may have some practicality issues to
argue but in principle is neutral.  The plaintiff had all along been represented by senior and junior counsel.  If the plaintiff
is really so mindful about time, he could dispense with the luxury of having the services of senior counsel.  There is no reason
to doubt junior counsel’s competency in an application of this nature. Had the plaintiff adopted this course instead of seeking
to vary the Order, the application would have, by now, been disposed of.  Probably, the practicality issues could be resolved much
more speedily by agreement instead of by argument with senior counsel before the court.  21.  As for the plaintiff’s application to vary the costs order, it mustbe borne in mind that the issue of costs is within the discretion
of the judge who had conduct of the proceeding.  The hearing on 13 July 2018 was essentially a direction hearing and hearing of the
IS.  Since the plaintiff adopted the wrong procedure and the IS served no purpose, there is no reason why if he succeeds in HCCW
218/2017, the respondents in that case should bear these costs.  It is appropriate that he should be deprived of his costs of thehearing
on 13 July 2018.  Mr Smith SC’s mirror argument has no merit.  Anyway, in HCMP 1721/2017, Madam Justice Lisa Wong reserved costs.
 What was lost in that case was not lost forever.  When the occasion comes for argument on costs, the plaintiff may have strong grounds
based on procedural irregularity to resist Zhang’s application for costs.  In any event, what costs order was awarded in another
case has no bearing on the costs order to be made in this case.  What the court has to do is to make a costs order which is proper
and appropriate.  In my view, the costs order made by Madam Justice Lisa Wong is proper and appropriate and one which the Court of
Appeal will not interfere.  I would also have made the same order myself were I in her shoes.  There is no reason to vary the costs
order. 22.  For the above reasons, the plaintiff’s variation summons is dismissed with no order as to costs.  BOCHK filed a skeleton submission.
 As the submission is more related to the discovery issue and has little bearing on the variation application, it would be more appropriate
to reserve the issue of BOCHK’s costs.",Date of Decision: 19 December 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2759.html,"

LAM SUK YEE AND ANOTHER v. THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KAM KIN MANSION [2018] HKCFI 2760; HCA 748/2011 (19 December 2018),"162.   The covered playground was converted into the units.  According to the expert opinion of the IO’s building surveyor expert which
is accepted by this court, the conversion created an air-tight chamber effect in the units such that any water infiltrated into the
ceiling of the covered playground could not escape into the open air.  That caused or aggravated the damage to the ceiling or other
structures of the unit.  Though the water leakage is not in dispute, the plaintiffs have failed to prove that had the covered playground
not been converted, the leakage will affect the enjoyment of the covered playground as a covered playground.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs’
claim in negligence is dismissed. 163.   The plaintiffs’ claim in nuisance was also launched on a similar false premise that they may increase the liability of their
neighbour by putting the covered playground to an exceptionally delicate or special use.   Given the design, construction and intended
use of LG3 and the covered playground, converting the covered playground into units for domestic use amounted to such exceptionally
delicate or special use in the circumstances.  By adopting the conversion, the plaintiffs upset the balance which has to be maintained
between themselves as owners of the covered playground and the IO as owners of the driveway.   As such, they are not entitled to
damages in nuisance.  164.   In conclusion, the plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with costs.","Conclusion

KAZUO OKADA v. THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES [2018] HKCFI 2778; HCAL 881/2018 (19 December 2018),"67.  In so far as the costs of Tomohiro are concerned, the general rule is that an unsuccessful applicant will normally not be required
to pay more than one set of costs where there are two or more respondents appearing (see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2019, Vol 1, at paragraph 53/14/63).  I see no reason why the same general rule should not apply where the court exercises the power to
hear a party under Order 53, rule 5B.  This having been said, the general rule may be departed from where there are good reasons
to do so on the facts of any given case.  The court’s exercise of discretion in matters relating to costs should remain flexible. 68.  In the present case, the court has benefitted considerably from the assistance rendered by Senior Counsel representing Tomohiro
(Mr Wong Yan Lung, SC).  However, the points raised on behalf of Tomohiro are, I believe, adequately covered by the submissions made
by Senior Counsel representing the Registrar (Mr Horace Wong, SC).  The Registrar is the decision-maker and the party ultimately
responsible for defending the legality of her decision.  While I can understand Tomohiro’s wish to be heard, I do not consider
that to be a sufficient justification to order the Applicant to bear two sets of costs.  Overall, I consider that the fair order
to make would be no order as to costs as between the Applicant and Tomohiro, including the reserved costs of the short hearing on
10 July 2018, and I so order. 69.  Lastly, it remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance rendered to the court.","Date of Judgment:

based on the acceptance of her evidence and that of Dr Cheung’s.  Ms Yu was terminated on 16 February 2017 as supported by the
undisputed Termination of Employment signed by A2 (Exhibit P7) and the termination was not in accordance with s 9 of the EO.  37.  In the circumstances, the convictions against both A1 and A2 were neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory.  The appellants’ appeals
against conviction are dismissed. ","Date of Judgment:

"HKSAR v. PILINOVICS, MARTIN ANTHONY [2018] HKCFI 147; HCMA 510/2018 (21 December 2018)","11.  The appellant has pleaded in this court that he suffers from a delusional disorder as he had been diagnosed in the UK and he said
that he had cut his wrist before coming to Hong Kong on his way to Taiwan to see his fiancée.  However, I do not see how that would
serve as proper mitigation in this case.  The fact is it was an opportunistic theft at the time he took the property from the lift.
 It was an opportunistic burglary when he climbed over the glass wall partition to steal the ticket and not only did he do it once,
he did it twice by climbing over that glass partition again and stealing the printer rolls. 12.  His second ground of appeal is that he asked for leniency to reduce the sentence so that he can go back to the UK to deal with matters
needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence. 13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There
is no merit to this appeal and so the appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

so they have not served a substantial part of the sentence yet. 17.  The evidence in this case is not weak and so I consider the proper thing is to order a retrial in this case. 18.

over 48% and therefore prima facie extortionate under section 25 sufficient to permit the court to reopen the transaction in question. 104.  Furthermore the cumulative effect of the plaintiff’s conduct, which I have described and its complete disregard for the provisions
of the MLO, would if I had needed it, also led me to find that even were the interest rate under 48%, the transaction in question
manifestly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing such that the court has the right under section 25 to reopen the transaction
and to make such orders and give such directions as the court may think fit.  In those circumstances I would have found the conduct
of the plaintiff so egregious that I would have required the defendant to be put back in the position she would have been had she
never been approached by Mr Cheung in the first place. 105.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendant be dismissed and I make a costs order nisi that the plaintiff pays the defendant’s costs, to be taxed if not agreed.","Date of Judgment:

before this court. Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2019 stated that where an interim order has been made after an inter partes hearing, the person seeking to discharge the order is not entitled to do so as of right or to re-argue it as if it were a re-hearing.
The court will generally only consider discharging an interim injunction on good grounds or due to a change in circumstances or facts
coming to light that cannot reasonably have been found out beforehand.[28] Here, D did not show any change in circumstances, and she had an even more uphill task since she had applied and failed to discharge
the Continued Injunction, and she did not appeal against the dismissal of the Discharge Summons. All D had shown was nothing more
than a serious question to be tried, which would not detract from the vitality of the Continued Injunction. 92.  In the circumstances, D’s Summons is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I grant a costs order nisi that D shall pay the Parents costs of and occasioned by D’s Summons (including all costs reserved if any) to be taxed forthwith

In my view, there were sufficient peculiar features in this case with a credible basis as explained under the 1st, 3rd and 4th Issues discussed above to show there was some other reason for trial under Order 14 rule 3 of the RHC. As explained in Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2019,[27] 63.   In the circumstances, I dismiss the Summons. Since the grounds put forward for resisting the Summons (filed after D had filed his
Defence) concerned inherent issues in respect of P’s own claim, it is appropriate to dismiss the Summons rather than to grant unconditional
leave to defend. I also grant directions that (a) the parties are to respectively file and serve List of Documents within 14 days
from the date of this order, and there be inspection of documents within 7 days thereafter, and (b) the parties are to comply with

is incredible. Facts are hotly in dispute.  I cannot and ought not decide them on affidavits. Triable issues have in my view been
shown.  They are in my further view arguable, so that there is fair probability of D2 having a real defence.  There are disturbing

14/4/9B of Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2019,which are very much relevant here.  I am not satisfied that this belongs to the type of clear cases which justify Order 14 relief. 24.

can conduct the affairs of a tso without any supervision.  But how should the court set the standard for the proper discharge of managers’ duty?  As mentioned by
Mr Kwan, different villages or tsos may have different ways of doing things, and so it would be very difficult for the court to set the proper standard in each case.
 If more cases of this nature are coming before the courts, Government authority must seriously look into this matter and to consider
whether there should be legislations to regulate the management of tso’s affairs.  I appreciate that these are sensitive and tricky issues, but I see no other option if more similar litigations require
the adjudication by the courts. 116.  Despite these observations, the Plaintiffs have failed to prove their case against the Defendants and the claim is therefore dismissed. 117.

this Court to vary the same.","$5,124,098(Thomas Leung)",Master of the High Court,/2018/2736.html,"

Interest on the judgment rate will be awarded on all sums from the date of judgment until payment. 37.  I ordered that the Defendant do pay the Plaintiff costs of these proceedings (including all costs reserved, if any), to be taxed
if not agreed. 38.  Lastly, I am grateful to Miss Leung for her helpful submissions.","$828,117.41(Barnabas Fung)",Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/2864.html,"

TIN FOO INVESTMENT CO LTD v. PREVIGOR DEVELOPMENT LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2870; HCA 1675/2014 (31 December 2018),"14.  Second, the Discovery Summons and Interrogatory 3, which were couched in unnecessarily wide terms, were essentially aimed at obtaining
the same information.  It was a misconceived effort.  They likewise covered a period of time in respect of which the plaintiff makes
no claim for any loss of rental income.  In any event, the reasons for which such information was said to be relevant and necessary
did not stand up to scrutiny.  See paragraphs 25, 26 and 28 of the Decision.  As in the case of Interrogatory 4, the plaintiff could
not be blamed for opposing Interrogatory 4 or the Discovery Summons, as they were drafted. 15.  In the circumstances, a fair costs order should reflect the defendants’ defeat for almost all their requests under the interrogatories
and the Discovery Summons. 16.  For these reasons, I order the defendants to pay 90% of the plaintiff’s costs both below and on appeal.  I fail to see any reason
to distinguish between the proceedings below and before me.  As Master Chow had already summarily assessed the plaintiff’s costs
below at HK$95,000, I will vary the costs order she made by ordering the defendants to pay HK$85,500 (i.e. HK$95,000 x 90%) to the
plaintiff for its costs of the Interrogatories Summons and the Discovery Summons before the master.  To facilitate the summary assessment
of 90% of the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal, I direct the plaintiff to file and serve a statement of its costs within 14 days
from today and the defendants to file and serve their statement of objections (if any) within 14 days thereafter.",(Lisa KY Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2870.html,"
