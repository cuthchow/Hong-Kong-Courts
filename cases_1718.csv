LEE SIU FONG v. WONG WAN LEUNG AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 3; HCA 122/2012 (3 January 2017),"Mr Mok Yeuk Chi and Mr Wilson Leung, instructed by the Department of Justice, for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants","133.  There is an issue about the counterclaim for possession by the Government.  According to Mr Mok, if the court were to find that
the Plaintiff is now occupying Lot 307 with the permission of the Government, then the counterclaim is not needed because the Government
by definition is already in possession of Lot 307. 134.  I have dealt with this issue briefly in §70 of this Judgment.   Because the Plaintiff has not pleaded any issue relating to the
validity of the MOT after the death of the Father, the witnesses had not been asked to deal with such issue in their oral testimony.
 However, based on the factors referred to in §§61 to 68 of this Judgment, I can only conclude that, despite the MOT had not been
formally transferred to the Plaintiff, he had been occupying the Land under some sort of implied licence after the death of the Father.
 So far as Lot 307 is concerned, the Government had withdrawn the licence in the end of 2011 when it returned the annual renewal
fee to the Plaintiff.  Hence, the Government is entitled to obtain an order for possession of the occupied parts of Lot 307 against
the Plaintiff.  I therefore grant judgment in favour of the 3rd Defendant on the counterclaim for such order of possession.  The counterclaim by the 2nd Defendant is dismissed. 135.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of the action be to the Defendants which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this
Judgment.","Dates of Trial: 6-8, 12, 18 January 2016Date of Judgment: 3 January 2017","(David Lok)

the submissions today and the lengthy privileged note on the draft consent summons placed before me.  I am satisfied that the terms
agreed upon by the parties are appropriate.  They were arrived at with the assistance of lawyers, past and present, of Mr Yau and
the DLA, upon a proper reflection of responsibility or the lack of it, and a true recognition of not wasting legal aid funds. 5.  In the premises, the court approves the settlement and I grant an order in terms of the consent summons as amended by me, which
terms should remain not open to public search. 6.  I only wish to add that in a case of this nature where a legally-aided litigant is asked to show cause as to why he should not bear
personal costs and a settlement is reached which is not a simple all‑or-nothing liability as to costs, it would be useful for the
litigant or the DLA to produce a short memorandum to explain the rationale behind the settlement terms.","Date of Decision: 6 January 2017(Queeny Au-Yeung)

renewal date should be 1 July 2015.  That was however after “the Expiry Date” of 30 June 2015.  Hence, the plaintiff had no authorization
to grant or renew to the defendant the licence for a year commencing on 1 July 2015 and expiring on 30 June 2016.  I therefore hold
that the defendant is not entitled to a license of back catalogue KMVs up to 30 June 2016. 108.  There is not much factual dispute between the parties in this application.  Unfortunately, the parties have in their affidavits/affirmations
made many hot but irrelevant accusations against each other.  These accusations do not assist the court in resolving the dispute.
 If this should happen again, consideration will be given on what appropriate costs order to make to reflect the waste of time and
resources for making such accusations.   109.

RE GW ELECTRONICS CO LTD [2017] HKCFI 98; HCCW 81/2016 (9 January 2017),"Mr Simon Yip, instructed by Fung Wong Ng & Lam LLP Solicitors, for the respondent","4.  The practice of the Companies Court in circumstances of this sort is quite clear.  A strike-out application effectively determines
the substantive issue in the petition.  If the strike-out issue is unsuccessful, a company will normally automatically be wound up,
unless the parties agree or the Court is persuaded that the petition should be adjourned in order to allow the company the opportunity
to settle the petitioner’s, and possibly other creditors’, claim.  If the petition is not going to be adjourned for reasons of
this sort, the company is wound up, and it is not the practice of the Companies Court to grant a stay pending an appeal of either
a decision to dismiss a strike-out application, or if the matter is determined at the trial of the petition, to challenge the Companies
Court’s judgment. 5.  What, in effect, the Company is seeking is the opportunity to file further evidence which would demonstrate that Anthony Chan J’s
decision was wrong.  This I am not prepared to do and would clearly be wrong in principle.  6.  As a final fall-back position, Mr Yip sought an adjournment of one week in order to give his clients the opportunity to consider whether they should pay so much of the debt as is possible.  The Petitioner
is not prepared to agree to an adjournment in order to allow the Company the opportunity to try and settle a claim which has been
outstanding for some considerable period of time, I will therefore make the normal winding-up order.",Date of Hearing: 9 January 2017Date of Decision: 9 January 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

THE LIQUIDATOR OF WING FAI CONSTRUCTION CO LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. YIP KWONG ROBERT AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 34; HCCW 735/2002 (11 January 2017),"Mr Barrie Barlow SC and Mr Chan Pat Lun, instructed by Haldanes, for the 2nd respondent  ","4.  By s 47 of the Evidence Ordinance the court is required, in civil proceedings, not to exclude evidence on the ground that it is hearsay unless it is objected to and
“the court is satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the exclusion of the evidence is not prejudicial
to the interests of justice��� (s 47(1)(b)).  The 1st and 3rd respondents had not objected to the admission of the evidence. 5.  Under Order 38 rule 21, where a party tenders a statement of a person as hearsay evidence without calling him, the court may allow other parties to call
and cross‑examine that person.  None of the respondents had applied to call Mr Chim or Ms Julia Ip for cross‑examination under
that rule.  I do not say that in every case a hearsay statement should be held admissible simply because the other side has not applied
for cross‑examination of the maker of the statement, but it is part of the circumstances that I may take into account.  In fact
I was told by counsel that Mr Chim could not be found by either side and so no subpoena could be served on him.  As regards Ms Julia
Ip there was no direct explanation why she had not been called, though the applicant would raise no objection if she was to be called
by the 2nd respondent for cross‑examination.  Mr Barlow SC said she was in Hong Kong but Ms Chan SC was not in a position to confirm it. 
Ms Chan SC submitted that the evidence of Ms Julia Ip was mainly relevant for establishing the applicant’s case as against the
1st and 3rd respondents, who had not made the same admissions as the 2nd respondent. Although both Mr Chim and Ms Ip had given assistance to the liquidators, that happened in 2004.  The latest contact between
the liquidators and Mr Chim that Mr Barlow SC could point to was in 2008.  The hearsay statements in dispute here had been with the
2nd respondent for a long time, but (with the exception of the interview of Mr Chim) only came into the applicant’s possession two
months before the trial, in August 2016.  6.  I am mindful that serious allegations are being made against the respondents including allegations of fraud, and that in such cases
the court will be reluctant to act on evidence untested by cross‑examination: see In re Smith and Fawcett Ltd [1942] Ch 304, 308.  But these concerns can in my view adequately be dealt with in the evaluation of the evidence, attributing such weight to the
evidence in question as may be appropriate taking into account all the relevant factors including those set out in s 49 of the Evidence Ordinance.  In all the circumstances I was not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to exclude the evidence altogether at this stage.
 The question of weight of course looms large.",Reasons for Ruling: 11 January 2017(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First Instance High Court,/2017/34.html,"Mr Ng Man Sang Alan and Mr Foster Yim, instructed by Wan Yeung Hau & Co, for the 1stt respondent",foster yim,chan pat lun,Haldanes,Wan Yeung Hau & Co,plaintiff,1.0

took a position on the legal effect of the Deeds of Licence that was, in my view, wrong, and steadfastly maintained it throughout

to call the documents “licences” and to stipulate that they should not be construed as creating any tenancy. 5.  Given the extent to which the parties have each prevailed on the question of costs, I shall make no order as to the costs of the

of substance turns on this issue.  I will order that paragraph 1.3 of the February order is varied to replace “31 December 2009”
with “31 December 2010”. 20.  The final matter concerns the publication of my February decision, which has not been uploaded onto the Judiciary website because
of concerns that the MOF might be reluctant to cooperate further if my reasons are made public at this stage.  I think it is desirable
that my reasons are made public as soon as possible, because they deal with matters of some importance.  However, I will delay doing
so until after the revised order for production has been implemented and it is clearer how the MOF responds to it. 21.  In the light of my conclusions in my view it is appropriate that KPMG pay the costs of those paragraphs of both summonses that have
been determined by this decision.  I make a costs order nisi to this effect.","No.

AA AND ANOTHER v.

I accept the explanation from the SFC that what has occurred was an innocent oversight on its part.  I am of the view that if an
application for leave to supply the court documents to the DoJ had been previously applied for by the SFC, it would have been granted
for the purpose of enabling the DoJ to consider whether to intervene.  This is in light of the circumstances that the SJ had a clear
interest to intervene in the proceedings because of the constitutional and public importance of the challenge to section 181.  I
do not consider that there has been any wilful or serious infraction of the order.  As far as I can ascertain, no prejudice or inconvenience
has been caused as a result of the provision of the court documents by the SFC to the DoJ.  33.  It is also of significance that the Court in allowing the joinder of the SJ as an intervener, it would as a party to the proceedings
have full access to the court documents in any event.  34.  In light of the foregoing, I do not consider that the order sought, even in its amended form, is an appropriate order for this Court
to make.  I refuse the application.  I order that the SFC pay the applicants’ costs in relation to the application, with a certificate
for two counsel.  ","Date of Decision:  13 January 2017(Kevin Zervos)

of the present action. P’s case was also bolstered by the Report which showed (a) cultivation at Lot 597 from 1963 until 1984 (consistent
with P’s case that she and Choi grew vegetables until about 1988) and scrubs and trees since 1990 (consistent with P’s case that
sugar cane was grown between 1989 and 1992 and fruit trees since 1992), and (b) cultivation at Lot 738 in 1963 that turned to trees
(since 1977), scrubs (since 1984), bushes (1994) and trees (since 2004) (consistent with P’s case that banana trees were grown
before 1990 and various kinds of fruit trees were grown after 1990). 49.  I am also persuaded that P and her family had occupied and used Lots 597 ad 738 exclusively, and that Choi and P had acquired the
requisite intention to possess such land, and had established possessory title over such land against the paper owners, ie D1 and
D2. 50.  Accordingly, at the Hearing, I granted the following order:","Area 4

                The area was used by Choi for crops until 1987. At this time trees were established which by the time of the Report
formed a thick wooded area.

                The area was covered by the Agricultural and Fisheries Department Irrigation Project (established in 1972 but unused
at the time of the Report). Trees evident at the time of the Report were longan, skeels (wampi) and custard apple. The area was mainly
Lot 597.Area 9

                The area was used by Choi’s neighbours for crops up to 1974. It was used by Choi for trees after 1987. At the time

According to the 4th and 5th Defendants, the financial condition of the 1st Defendant is healthy.  It was only because the Plaintiff could not identify the location of the 1st Defendant’s assets that the two sets of Mainland legal proceedings did not produce much fruitful result.  However, if the Defendants
were not evasive about their assets, I cannot think of any logical reason as to why the Plaintiff would not have continued the legal
proceedings in the Mainland, as it had already commenced not just one but two set of legal proceedings against them in the first
place.  One must bear in mind that the Plaintiff had already made two attempts to sue the Defendants in the alternative forum but
without much result.   Hence, the Plaintiff’s complaint about the loss of juridical advantages is one with substance and I also
find in favour of the Plaintiff in the Stage II inquiry. 57.  I turn proceed to Stage III.  Whilst one may certainly argue that the juridical disadvantages suffered by the Plaintiff are not
particularly serious, the fundamental problem remains, without knowing the nature of the dispute between the parties, the court would
not be able to assess the advantages if the trial is conducted in the Nanjing Court.   The court is therefore not in a position to
conduct the balancing exercise under the Stage III inquiry.  In my judgment, as the 4th and 5th Defendants should be held responsible for failing to put forward the crucial information necessary for the conduct of the balancing
exercise, the court should also find in favour of the Plaintiff in the Stage III inquiry.  Hence, the 4th and 5th Defendants fail in all stages of the inquiry. 58.  For the above reasons, I dismiss their stay application and order them to file the Defence within 28 days.  I also make a costs
order nisi that the costs of the summons be paid by them to the Plaintiff which shall be made absolute 21 days after the date of the handing
down of this Decision.",Dates of Further Written Submissions: 20 & 24 May 2016Date of Decision: 16 January 2017,"(David Lok)

HKSAR v. YEUNG HOI SHAN [2017] HKCFI 62; HCMA 202/2016 (16 January 2017),"Mr Cheng Huan SC, Mr Peter Chung and Mr Arthur Chan, instructed by Raymond Chan Solicitors, for the appellant","24.  Nevertheless, given the positive good character of the appellant and the fact that both parties appeared to be in error/some confusion
before the court below, I took the view, in my discretion, that the fairer way forward was to give the appellant the opportunity
to place before this court admissible evidence as to his ingestion of prescription medicine that evening.  He did so. In the form
of Dr Chan and by giving evidence himself.  In the end this did not avail him.  Dr Chan gave evidence as to why and what had been
prescribed to the appellant and that he had explained the effects of alcohol combined with these prescription drugs.  He explained
that he had been concerned about the increasing level of the appellant’s intake of alcohol over the period he had treated him and
that he had advised him frequently of the combined effects of alcohol and drugs and that this could lead to a loss of inhibition.
 His evidence was that the real risk of intoxication, if there was any in the circumstances of this case, came from the 1.5 mg of
Bromazepam rather than the other two drugs which had been prescribed and the effect of the Bromazepam after 20 hours would depend
upon a number of circumstances but would be at the lower end.  In his opinion, the combined effect of Bromazepam with alcohol would
depend upon the time between the consumption of the two, the speed of consumption of alcohol, the amount of alcohol, the amount the
patient had eaten and his general health.  Whilst Dr Chan explained the drugs prescribed and their potential effect upon the appellant,
it became clear that their effect would have been towards the lower end at the time this offending took place in the evening of 5
June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking the medicine.  It was also clear that the appellant had voluntarily and knowingly drank
an excessive amount of sake (ten glasses) in a relatively short space of time and was aware of his inebriation after visiting the
fourth of ten tables, yet he did not stop drinking.  That inebriation brought out the worst in him.  He behaved in a disgraceful
way towards Miss Yeung and the police officers.  He showed some remorse before this court about his behaviour towards the police
officers but absolutely no remorse at all in respect of his behaviour towards the young lady whom he assaulted that evening.  His
attitude in court suggested that his behaviour that night had nothing to do with prescription medicine or alcohol but more to do
with his attitude to young women generally even when sober. 25.  Having given the appellant the benefit of the doubt and allowed him to adduce admissible evidence of involuntary intoxication before
this court, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the dangers of consuming alcohol whilst on prescription
drugs and that the appellant nevertheless went on to do so.  He did so on 5 June 2015, some 20 hours after last taking his medicine,
when the risk of the combined effect of alcohol and drugs was near its lowest end and was far less likely to have any significant
effect.  He voluntarily and knowingly drank an excessive amount of sake and continued to do so even after he knew he had become inebriated.
 He went on to assault Miss Yeung and the police officers who were brought in to prevent further mishap and he is fully responsible
for that behaviour.  Accordingly I dismiss this appeal. 26.  Costs of the appeal be to the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.","Date of Judgment: 16 January 2017(A P Campbell‑Moffat)

SARAS GOPI v. BINA DEEGAN [2017] HKCFI 295; HCA 3075/2015 (19 January 2017),"Mr David Morrison, instructed by Reed Smith Richards Butler, for the defendant","14.  It is said on behalf of Mrs Deegan that Mrs Gopi has a track record of taking such steps as she can to defeat the claims of her
creditors.  I am not in a position to judge that, because it assumes that various adverse findings will be made against Mrs Gopi
at the trial of the action, and I am not prepared to make that assumption.  Having said that, though, there is unfortunately so much
animosity between the parties in this case that Mrs Gopi might be tempted to put such assets which she has beyond the reach of her
daughter.  The fact is that the court should not ignore the practical realities of a dispute of this kind. Moreover, this application
for security for costs is seeking to protect Mrs Deegan against not being able to enforce an order for costs in her favour at the
end of the trial which is still a long time off.  Anything can happen to Mrs Gopi’s assets in that time.  All in all, therefore,
although it may be possible for Mrs Deegan to enforce any order for costs made in her favour, that is no more than a possibility,
and in any event the enforcement of orders made in Hong Kong against overseas assets could well be a costly exercise.  In the circumstances,
I do not think that these considerations should deter me from making an appropriate order for security for costs. 15.  But what is the appropriate order in this case?  Three points need to be made. First, since it is argued on behalf of Mrs Deegan,
and I agree, that there is very little overlap between the claims and the counterclaims, it follows that the sum which Mrs Gopi should
be ordered to provide by way of security should not include the costs of the loan claim, the share claim, the property claim and
the assault claim.  Otherwise, the order would be tantamount to requiring Mrs Gopi to provide security to her daughter for the prosecution
of the counterclaim.  A skeleton bill of costs prepared by Mrs Deegan’s solicitors does not exclude those costs. 16.  Secondly, the skeleton bill of costs (which covers the period up to the date of setting down) includes expenditure on items which
may not be incurred, for example, it includes the costs of applications for specific discovery, for further and better particulars
and for letters of request for the taking of evidence abroad.  Although Mr Morrison for Mrs Deegan assures me that those applications
will be made, you never know with certainty in litigation what is going to happen.  Thirdly, the skeleton bill of costs, is pitched
at a level greater than I think the bill would be taxed at, including, for example, the solicitors’ hourly rates.  It is completely
inappropriate for me to subject the bill to an item by item analysis.  Everyone agrees that nothing but a broad-brush approach is
appropriate.  Applying such an approach, I think that I should order Mrs Gopi to provide her daughter with security for costs in
the sum of $2,000,000.00. Subject to any further submissions on the topic,  I propose to stay all proceedings on the claim until
that security is provided.  I shall hear from the parties how that security should be provided.",Date of Hearing: 19 January 2017Date of Judgment: 19 January 2017,"(Brian Keith)

two summonses issued by Ps on 4 November 2016, respectively in the Main Action and the Contempt Proceedings. 70.  I have indicated at the hearing that costs will be reserved. This matter is to be dealt with on paper unless otherwise directed.

For the above reasons, at the hearing, I ordered that judgment be entered against the 2nd defendant in respect of the Sum, but refused granting the declaratory relief (as well as the consequential relief of account) in
favour of the plaintiff in respect of its constructive trust claim. 29.  In its application, the plaintiff also asks me to vary the Mareva injunction so as to permit that the plaintiff to withdraw the Sum from the 2nd defendant’s account.

at the hearing and was not prepared to do so without any proper application supported by proper evidence.  In any event, I doubt
very much whether such variation if necessary.  Even if it turns out to be necessary, the plaintiff can still make an application

However, given the 1st and 2nd defendants’ indication at the hearing that they need legal aid to fund their litigation, I have concern that as they are currently

by any costs order that this court may make in relation to such costs thrown away by the adjournment of the trial. 56.  Applying the relevant legal principles and balancing all the factors, I am persuaded that justice and fairness require this court

 That concession applies particularly to the requirement to disclose any assets in the defendants’ possession valued at $50,000.00
or more.  Such an order is, on the face of it, no longer necessary in the light of the payment into court which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam
are prepared to make.  But in any event, disclosure of this kind may well be appropriate when an order seeking the freezing of all
of a defendant’s assets up to a certain amount is sought.  The plaintiff will want to know what assets the defendant has in order
to police any freezing order he obtains.  But this is not that sort of case.  There is no freezing order sought in respect of all
the defendants’ assets up to a certain amount.  The freezing order which is sought is limited to the receivables which have been
paid to PSG and YMH.  All in all, the disclosure which Mr Ma is entitled to at this particular stage of the proceedings must be limited
to that disclosure which PSG, YMH and Mr Lam are prepared to give.  15.  That deals with the contentious issues which arise on Mr Ma’s summons, and I am confident that I can leave it to the parties to
draw up an order which reflects the terms of this judgment. 16.  I think that the appropriate order for costs is that the costs of today be reserved to the judge who hears the application on the
return date, with liberty to apply in the event of there not being a return date and the parties not being able to agree the costs
which I have just reserved.",Date of Judgment: 20 January 2017(Brian Keith),Deputy Judge of the High Court,/2017/317.html,The 1st defendant appeared in person,in person,lincoln cheung,,,defendant,0.0

The letter to Cosimo Borrelli dated 19 January 2007 and the letter to Messrs. Robert Siu were signed by the late Mr. Hung.  In the
first letter, there is a date on which the letter was faxed to the recipient.  D4 admits that the evidence would have great impact
on the result of the case as he said they “contained very serious allegations against the 4th Defendant which could have significant impact on the case...”[5]  To exclude them would obviously prejudice P’s case. Pursuant to s.47 of the Evidence Ordinance, they should be admissible, subject to the weight to be given by the trial judge.  The question as to what weight should be accorded
to these letters is a matter for the trial judge.  D4 may raise those questions and inconsistencies between the letters and other
evidence as set out in the written submissions before the trial judge. P, D4 and D5 are at liberty to call Mr. Cosimo Borrelli and
Mr. Robert Siu or the handling solicitor of this case or either of them to give witness statement or to issue subpoenas to secure
their attendance in court at trial in relation to those letters. 36.  As to the costs of this application, each party asks for costs of this application, with certificate for counsel.  Under O.62, r.3

there was none in the present action. 64.  The Appeal is dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I grant a costs order nisi that D shall forthwith pay P costs of the Appeal to be summarily assessed. I also give directions for the summary assessment of costs

D’s estate agent for the Transaction. However, LHC were the solicitors who acted for D in relation to the Cancellation Agreement
which reiterated and confirmed the PASP, and which recited P as D’s agent and also the terms of the PASP including clause 10a without
any mention of Yancy at all. This did not sit well with D’s case put forward to this court at the Appeal Hearing. As a matter of

“control test” for the purpose of determining whether an employment relationship exists, I have not had the benefit of considering
any contrary submissions by the Taxpayer, understandably because he is currently acting in person.  In view of the fact that I am
here only dealing with an application for leave to appeal, I do not consider that this is an appropriate occasion for me to undertake
a detailed examination of Mr Leung’s legal submissions.  All that I would say is that, having carefully considered the substance
of Mr Leung’s submissions, I am prepared to hold that the Commissioner’s proposed appeal raises a question of law (namely, whether,
for the purpose of determining whether an employment relationship exists, it is any longer necessary to apply, or have regard to,
the “economic reality test” and/or the “control test”), and the proposed appeal has a “reasonable prospect of success”
under Section 69(3)(e) of the Ordinance.  For this purpose, I consider that a proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success
if it is “reasonably arguable”; it is not necessary to show that the proposed appeal will “probably” succeed. 21.  Various other grounds of the Commissioner’s proposed appeal (Grounds 4 to 9) relate to the Board’s treatment of the evidence.
 On their own, I would not be minded to grant leave to appeal.  However, the matters raised in those grounds could, arguably, be
relevant to a holistic evaluation of the facts and circumstances in this case, and therefore relevant to Ground 10 (the so-called
“catch-all” ground) to the effect that the Board came to a decision which no tribunal, properly directed, could reasonably have
reached.  In all the circumstances, I do not propose to limit the grounds on which leave to appeal is granted in the present application. 22.

impact that the inclusion of “custody” would have on the possession counts concerning the 2nd defendant.  I gave Mr Kwok time so he could consider the proposed amendments.  He maintained his objections but had nothing further
to add. 35.  From my own observation, it would seem that the second re‑amendments do not make any material changes to the case or cases that
the defendants face, or at least to cause any prejudice or inconvenience to them in the conduct of their case, and more particularly
any prejudice to receiving a fair trial.  36.  I am of the view that the second re-amendments do not offend any of the principles as submitted to me or cause any prejudice or
inconvenience to the defence, and the joinder is justified as demanded by the interests of justice.  Accordingly, the second re-amendments

CHENG TANG KAM YUNG v. TANG KAM CHEUNG AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 168; HCMP 147/2008 (8 February 2017),The 1st Defendant appeared in person,"39.  Another complaint of the 1st Defendant is that the hearing lasted for 50 minutes.  I note that the two summonses were listed for 3 minutes’ hearing only.  That
might be the reason why DHCJ Leung specifically granted a certificate for counsel.  Apparently, the estimate of the 1st Defendant about the hearing time was not accurate when he took out the summonses.  From the documents found in the taxation bundle,
it can be seen that counsel prepared skeleton arguments as well as supplemental submissions.  I do not find the brief fee for counsel
to deal with the two summonses to be excessive or unreasonable, bearing in mind the particular matters of concern in the present
case.  This item is to be allowed in full. 40.  In conclusion, the sum allowed for items 1, 3 and 4 of Section B is to be revised upward from $40,000 to $45,000, and the sum allowed
for item 6 of Section B is to be revised downward from $18,000 to $14,000. There is no change for the other items. 41.  Although there have been revisions in respect of the costs allowed for some of the items, the 1st Defendant is over all in a worse off position.  I therefore order, on a nisi basis, that costs of the review be paid by the 1st Defendant personally to the Plaintiff and to be summarily assessed, if not agreed.  Unless an application for variation of the costs
order nisi is filed within 14 days from the date hereof, the Plaintiff shall file and serve her statement of costs within 21 days

Hui & Co., assignedby Director of Legal Aid, for the 2nd defendant","24.  The three robberies were carried out by the two defendants in concert and with the understanding that each would play a particular
role.  They bear equal culpability for each of the robberies.  The only mitigating factor that can be taken into account on their
behalf are their pleas of guilty for which they are entitled to a one-third discount, and to some extent their relatively young age
but which in the end deserves little if any weight because of the serious nature and multiplicity of the offences.  25.  On Count 1, I reduce the starting point of 6 years’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years’ imprisonment.  On Count 2, I reduce
the starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  On Count 3, I reduce the starting
point of 6 years and 6 moths’ imprisonment by one third to 4 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.  26.  The fact that the defendants were involved in three robberies has been taken into account by me when addressing the totality principle.
 I therefore order that the sentence on Count 1 to be served concurrently to the sentences on Counts 2 and 3 and that the sentence

HKSAR v. PANG CHI-YIP [2017] HKCFI 231; HCCC 450/2016 (17 February 2017),"Mr Freddy Woon, instructed by Cheung & Liu, assigned by Director of 
				Legal Aid, for the defendant","8.  The Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 revised the sentencing tariffs for a person convicted of trafficking of Ice as contained in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125.  The new tariffs apply in this case.  The narcotic content of Ice of 12.52 g falls within the band of 10 to 70 g where the sentence
after trial ranges from 7 to 11 years’ imprisonment.  I will adopt for this quantity of drugs, a starting point of 7 years’ imprisonment
which I discount by one-third for his plea at the earliest opportunity to 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  In relation to the
possession offence, I adopt a starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment which I also discount by one-third to 8 months’ imprisonment.
 9.  Taking into account the totality principle and the circumstances of the defendant, I order that the sentence for the possession
offence run concurrently to the sentence for the trafficking offence.  I have borne in mind that the drugs found in the defendant’s
possession, had they been included in the trafficking offence would not have made a marked difference to the sentence that I have
imposed. 10.  Accordingly, the defendant will serve a sentence of 4 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.","Dates of Hearing:

he charges separately for this application. 29.  I therefore order that Mr Tsui should pay Madam Wong her costs of these two applications, to be taxed if not agreed. With respect

The defendant has an alternative application in reliance on Order 23 rules 1, 3, 4 and 5 for indemnity costs from 11 May 2016 based
on the sanctioned payment it paid into court on 13 April 2016.  For the reasons given above, I consider it unjust to so order.  24.  The defendant also seeks in the summons an order for payment out of the $2 million paid into court by it on 13 April 2016 together
with all interest accrued.  The plaintiff does not oppose this part of the summons.  I therefore make an order that the $2 million
paid into court by the defendant on 13 April 2016 together with all interest accrued be paid out to the defendant’s solicitors

For the above reasons, it is only fair for the Respondent to withhold interim distribution to all the beneficiaries including herself
pending the final determination of the claims against the Applicants or at least the provision of explanations and supporting documents
relating to the substantial transfers.  Using the words of Swinfen Eady J in Re Rhodesia Goldfields Limited, it would be a “strange travesty of equity” to allow the Applicants to be paid out of the Estate only “subsequently to find after it had been established that [they] owed money to the fund, that the amount could not be recovered from
[them].” 69.  Despite my ruling above, I have to emphasise that interim distribution application is a time-sensitive application.  The existing
justification in not making interim distribution may no longer be valid if there is any material change in circumstances, for example,
the Applicants are able to provide credible explanations for the making of the substantial transfers.  Hence, there should be liberty
to the Applicants to make a fresh application in appropriate circumstances. 70.  I understand that the parties have reserved their position on costs.  Since this case relates to the administration of a deceased’s
estate, the question of costs may not be a straightforward matter. I therefore give liberty to the parties to restore the hearing
for argument on costs.  If they consider that the question of costs is simple enough to be dealt with on paper, they should try to

Ground (vi) has no merits.  If the 1st summons was already issued way out of time, an application to amend it to add a further item of relief could not be anything other

deal with any matters overlooked by counsel or the court when making the costs order nisi.  Moreover, lawyers are used to dealing with multi-issues and there is no room for them to say that they have been distracted by
the opponent’s unwarranted interlocutory applications and failed to make a proper application. 15.  Ground (vii) has no merits.  It was another exercise of discretion based on the lengthy delay. 16.

Mr Lam informs the court that the plaintiff will not be maintaining the application for an indemnity in respect of its present applications.
 I should mention that I would not, in any event, order the 5th defendant to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of the costs of their summonses dated 14 December 2016 and 15 December 2016 respectively,
because (i) the plaintiff has been largely unsuccessful in those applications (save in respect of the basis of assessment of the
costs to be paid by the 1st defendant and the 5th defendant[1]), and (ii) the application for indemnity cannot be regarded as an application made for the benefit of the 5th defendant. 27.  The 1st defendant has been successful in resisting the variations sought by the plaintiff and the 5th defendant in so far as he might be affected by them. I consider that his costs should be borne by the plaintiff and the 5th defendant, to be assessed on a party and party basis, if not agreed, and I so order. 28.

I do not agree with the objection as the jury would be informed that the purpose of the screen is to maintain the anonymity of the
police officers whose duties include carrying out surveillance.  As I understand the case, the police officers concerned are in fact
giving evidence in relation to the surveillance they conducted on the defendants. 4.  I do not think the principle of open justice is in any way materially offended as everyone in the courtroom, other than members
of the public, will be able to see the police officers give evidence, and everyone in the courtroom will be able to hear their evidence.
 The jury will be appropriately directed to ensure that they do not view the arrangement in any way adversely to the defendants.

Although the arguments in favour of the appointment of Mr Leiduck Jr prevailed at the end of the day, I see no basis for the plaintiff
to be visited with the costs of the Next Friend Application, the need for which cannot in any way be attributed to the plaintiff. 20.  On the other hand, while the Next Friend Application was not a matter on which the plaintiff should have had no say and the matters
raised in the B&M Letter were not entirely invalid, I find the plaintiff’s stance of formally not opposing the application
and then turning up with both leading and junior counsel to effectively oppose the application at the hearing to be disingenuous.
 I would have been sufficiently assisted by the B&M Letter. 21.  In the circumstances, I am prepared to order the 1st defendant to pay the plaintiff only the costs of the B&M Letter to be assessed summarily.  The plaintiff should file and serve
a statement of costs within 14 days.  The 1st defendant should file and serve a statement of objections (if any) within 14 days thereafter.  The plaintiff should have 14 days

by the Wongs’ domestic helpers) had changed, and such use/ occupation reflected an intention to exclusively occupy the Property
against D1 and the world at large. 41.  In the circumstances, I find P had established factual possession over the Property for not less than 12 years before the commencement
of the present proceedings. I am also persuaded P and his family/helpers had occupied and used the Property exclusively since 1995,
and since then he had the requisite intention to adversely possess the Property. Hence P had established possessory title over the

that a further discount of 6 months would be appropriate.  I am aware that the discount by some judges in the High Court is almost comparable in terms of percentage
given to those who rendered assistance to law enforcement authorities.  I am of the view that in the absence of evidence of positive
tangible result (as in the case of this defendant), the discount should not be comparable to actual assistance given to authorities.

The suggestion of replacing the references to the defendants in the 5th defendant’s statements with a letter of the alphabet is neither appropriate nor practical.  The prosecution case against the 5th defendant is based on his admissions about his dealings with the other defendants as alleged in the conspiracy count.  It will only
confuse the jury as why the persons are referred to by an alphabetical letter when it is alleged that he and the other defendants
conspired together to make explosives, in the form of smoke bombs.  The prosecution case also relies on surveillance evidence where
it is alleged that they meet and gathered together on the occasions the 5th defendant describes in his statements.  I should add that the 5th defendant’s out of court statements is admissible evidence only against the 5th defendant, and this will be made clear to the jury.  39.  In my view, the issue of the 5th defendant’s admissions in his out of court statements can be fairly and properly dealt with by giving full and proper directions
to the jury. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, I refuse the application and the defendants will face trial together on the five counts as contained

nature of the case that the prosecution seek to prove; the principal overt acts from which the prosecution invite the jury to infer

addressing the essential element of the conspiracy to be proved need to be clear and precise, whereas the overt acts from which the
jury is invited to infer the existence of an agreement will depend upon the evidence presented during the trial.  However, any change
of the case should not disadvantage or prejudice a defendant in the conduct of his defence so as to deprive him of a fair trial.

agreement, including the nature and quantity of the explosive substance(s) that the prosecution allege was the object of the conspiratorial

I do not agree that the court should now disturb the stay of the Arbitration proceedings.  First, the arbitrator should have more
flexibility to deal with the issue of costs after looking at the result of the taxation proceedings.  Depending on the degree of
the taxing down of the Bills (if any), the arbitrator may take different view as to who should bear the costs of the Arbitration
proceedings.  Second, it may not be right for the Respondent to say that the only outstanding matter in the Arbitration proceedings
is costs.  If the Applicants still refuse to pay the taxed fees after taxation, the Respondent may still have to proceed with the
Arbitration to compel the Applicants to pay the taxed fees.  In my judgment, it would be more prudent for the parties to conclude
the Arbitration after the taxation proceedings.  Third, I understand that the parties will soon fix the dates for the taxation hearing,
and so it may be an exaggeration to say that the arbitrator would have to wait indefinitely for the result of the taxation of the
Bills.  For these reasons, I reject the Lifting of Stay Application. 30.  I make the following costs order nisi: 31.

LEE PO WING v. SEE WAH FAN [2017] HKCFI 376; HCMP 1771/2013 (7 March 2017),The defendant acting in person,"35.  Mr Lee seeks summary assessment of his costs and has produced a costs statement in which he claims the following items of costs:- 36.  Mr Lee’s affirmation, of 34 pages long, contains, essentially, a list of the unsuccessful legal proceedings previously instituted
by Madam See. There is also a single exhibit to the affirmation consisting of a bundle, without any index, of 1,017 pages of previous
court documents.  If it is decided to include a number of documents in one exhibit, a proper index of the documents should be prepared.
 I pause to observe that the same bundle of 1,017 pages of documents was reproduced as part of the hearing bundles (in 3 volumes),
also without any index.  As mentioned in the course of the hearing, I consider the preparation of the hearing bundles in this manner
to be entirely unsatisfactory. 37.  In view of the fact, as I understand it to be the case, that Mr Lee was involved in most if not all of the previous legal proceedings
brought by Madam See, I consider the time spent by him in preparing the affirmation to be excessive.  I would allow 16 hours of work
for preparation of the affirmation.  I therefore summarily assess Mr Lee’s costs at HK$88,600 (HK$6,600 + HK$4,000 per hour x 20.5

this would significantly ameliorate any prejudice otherwise faced by the plaintiff pending a determination of the merits of its claim
and, in the circumstances, an appropriate order for costs would indeed largely compensate any residual prejudice. 12.  Accordingly, the 4th defendant’s application to set aside the default judgement was allowed, conditional upon the payment in by the 4th defendant of the sum of HK$466,500, plus interest in the sum of HK$10,000. 13.  I record that it was common ground between the parties that although the setting aside application strictly speaking addressed only
paragraph 2 of the order of Lam J dated 2 December 2016, the setting aside, together with the payment in by the 4th defendant carried with it the discharge of the Mareva injunction set out at paragraph 1 of that order.

Counterclaim, the defendant alleged that Mr Chung (Chairman of Tsuen Wan Rural Committee) advised the Deceased that the transfer
of the Property to the plaintiff could be done “by way of testamentary gift in order to save costs and to avoid the payment of
land premium to the Hong Kong Government”.  In paragraph 5 of her 2nd affirmation filed on 7 October 2016, the plaintiff said that she had never heard that “there was this Mr Chung Wai Ping who gave
any advice to [the Deceased] in August 2003” as alleged.  Mr Chan submits that this evidence of the plaintiff is rebutted by the
contents of the August 2003 Letter.  As I see it, the letter does not, in fact, give any clue on the advice (if any) given by Mr
Chung to the Deceased.  In any event, the comments in paragraph 26 above also apply to this criticism of the plaintiff’s evidence. 28.  Overall, I do not consider that the various matters raised by the defendant, whether taken individually or cumulatively, are sufficient
to raise any triable issue that the Deceased did not know or approve of the contents of the 2003 Will at the time of execution of
that document. 29.  For the above reasons, I give summary judgment for the plaintiff, and strike out the defendant’s counterclaim, in terms of paragraphs
1 and 2 of the plaintiff’s summons dated 7 October 2016.  I also make an order nisi that: (i) the defendant shall pay the plaintiff the costs of this action, including the costs of and occasioned by the summons, to
be taxed on a party and party basis if not agreed, with certificate for counsel, and (ii) the plaintiff’s costs, to be assessed

Lastly, it is suggested there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether there is credible evidence that the shares have been
sold as alleged by the plaintiff.  As I pointed out in my judgment, there is in fact no direct evidence before the court as to the
sale of the shares.  The evidence is based upon assumptions that shares registered in the name of Standard Chartered Bank must belong
to certain individuals but these assumptions are unsupported by any corroborating evidence.  Indeed, the only direct evidence before
the court is to the effect the shares are still in the custody of the defendant’s custodian, Beaufort Securities Limited. 7.  Even if, however, there was anything in any of the above three grounds of appeal, the plaintiff is unable to overcome the fatal
obstacle to his case in respect of an injunction, namely that damages are clearly an adequate remedy.  There is simply no evidence
before the court to gainsay that damages would not be an adequate remedy and in such circumstances it is clear from all the authorities
that an injunction will not lie.  In such circumstances, I have no hesitation therefore in dismissing this application for leave
to appeal. 8.  I order that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs of this application on a party and party basis such costs to be assessed

As for the submission made on behalf of Chan, that adverse inferences should be drawn against the JV for its failure to call Mr
Wong as its witness at trial, I accept the explanation given on behalf of the JV.  Mr Wong’s statement only deals with the disputed
items 6.8-6.14 of Appendix 1, which were not pursued at trial.  Further, as Counsel for the JV pointed out, the drawing of an adverse
inference is only appropriate when the opponent’s assertion and claim is credible.  The issues remaining in dispute at trial are
adequately clear without the need to call Mr Wong, and any adverse inference against the JV by reason of its failure to call Mr Wong
would not have assisted Chan’s case.  As the court rightly observed in Gleneagle Holdings Ltd v Tse Yue Fong & others HCA 2807/2006 12 May 2009, it would be unreasonable to draw an adverse inference against a party to give support to an assertion
which cannot even stand on its own, or is not established. 58.  In the light of the findings I have made on the assessment, parties should submit (within 7 days of the handing down of this judgment)

"HKSAR v. HOANG, THI HANG [2017] HKCFI 424; HCMA 607/2016 (13 March 2017)",The appellant appeared in person,"13.  Is 8 months of charge 3 to be made consecutive to charge 2 excessive?  In deciding how many months to make consecutive requires
the Magistrate to ensure he avoids imposing a total sentence that is too severe and unjustified.  He should assess the overall criminal
criminality of the appellant’s crimes.  Here the magistrate made 8 months or about 50% consecutive.  Ms Ma for the respondent did
submit an authority, HKSAR v Mohomed Rahoof Mohomed Sajahan, HCMA 270/2014 to demonstrate the 15-month sentence after a plea is equally applicable to a defendant who uses a forged identity
card to prolong her stay here or hide her identity.  The respondent submits that sentence is equally applicable to the facts of charge
3 as it is to charge 2 where the appellant used it to obtain employment.  I agree with her submission but at the same time mindful
of the very different motive behind using a forged identity card in both instances. 14.  Although I do not find any fault in the individual sentences, I find the total sentence of 23 months on the high side when I take
into account the appellant’s criminality overall.  I am of the view that a sentence of 19 months’ imprisonment in this present
case will suffice to reflect the culpability of the appellant. 15.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that now 4 months of the 15-month sentence of charge 3 will be served consecutively to the 15‑month
sentence of charge 2.  The appellant is to serve a term of imprisonment reduced from 23 months to a total of 19 months.",Date of Hearing: 8 March 2017Date of Judgment: 13 March 2017,"(Amanda J Woodcock)

HKSAR v. PABITA RAUT [2017] HKCFI 434; HCMA 551/2016 (14 March 2017),The appellant appeared in person,"18.  The magistrate found on the evidence the appellant was working in the kitchen.  She was washing dishes in a staff-only area and
had on an apron and wellington boots to do the task.  Her personal belongings were stored in the staff-only area.  I am satisfied
from the evidence and papers that the sole and irresistible inference of employment can be drawn and the elements of this offence
can be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. 19.  In arriving at his sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010] HKCA 613; [2010] 5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for section 38AA offences.  Here, the appellant was convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence
of 22 months and 2 weeks is correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain
mitigating factors such as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here the appellant
did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm.  20.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellant.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and is
not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.  I also dismiss the appeal against sentence.",Date of Hearing: 8 March 2017Date of Judgment: 14 March 2017,"(Amanda J Woodcock)

"HKSAR v. MUTHUKRISHNAN, SELVARAJAN [2017] HKCFI 449; HCMA 559/2016 (16 March 2017)",The appellant appeared in person,"26.  The magistrate drew the irresistible inference based on facts she found proved the appellant was working in the recycling yard and
was employed at the material time.  In paras 36 to 39 of her statement of findings she sets out the facts she relies on to draw that
necessary inference as well as the relevant authority.  I too am satisfied on the evidence that the only irresistible inference that
can be drawn is that the appellant was taking employment and it was proved beyond reasonable doubt.  I dismiss the appeal against
conviction.  27.  In arriving at her sentence the magistrate considered the relevant authority of HKSAR v Usman Butt & another [2010]5 HKLRD 452. The Court of Appeal laid down the guideline of 15 months’ imprisonment on a plea for section 38AA offences.  Here, the appellant was convicted after trial and lost the benefit of a discount after a plea of guilty.  Hence the sentence
of 22 months and 2 weeks is correct following the guideline.  Of course a sentencing magistrate can depart from it if there are certain
mitigating factors such as a voluntary surrender to the authorities, merciful reasons or strong humanitarian grounds.  Here, the
appellant did not present any mitigation that merited a departure from the norm either upon conviction or during the appeal. 28.  In this case, there is nothing to show the magistrate passed a sentence which is beyond the guideline laid down or which fails to
take into account any mitigation to the benefit of the appellant.  I therefore find the sentence of the magistrate correct and it
is not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.  I also dismiss the appeal against sentence.",Date of Hearing: 8 March 2017Date of Judgment: 16 March 2017,"(Amanda J Woodcock)

Mr Lam reminds the court that a pleading should not be struck out save in a plain and obvious situation.  I agree.  However, the
limitation point raised by Mr Wou is a short point of law.  Although it is by no means an easy one, I do not consider that any useful
purpose will be served by postponing its determination, there being no suggestion that further evidence may be adduced at the trial
which could be relevant to its proper resolution. 40.  For the above reasons, I hold that the claim for an account in paragraph 125 of the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, to the
extent that it relates to remittances made on or before 12 July 2007, is time-barred.  Since the parties have not addressed me on
the question of whether the striking out of the entries relating to remittances made on or before 12 July 2007 in Appendices A to
A-11 would or may have any impact on other pleas in the Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim, I shall leave it to the parties to agree
on the form of the order to give effect to this decision, with liberty to apply in the event of disagreement. 41.  The parties are agreed that the costs of the strike out application should follow the event. Accordingly, Wong shall pay Liu the
costs of and occasioned by the strike out summons dated 3 March 2017, to be assessed on a party and party basis if not agreed, with

As far as I am aware, the presence of security provided by a third party is not a defence to an action against the debtor or a winding-up

of the court in deciding whether to make a winding-up order, the fact that the petitioner is secured by virtue of a charge or pledge
over third party’s assets is something that I can and should take into account. 23.  But this consideration, in my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, is not an independent ground for opposition to the petition. 24.

Finally, there is scant evidence that potential tenants of the ground floor units in the Tak Bo Building who would require water
and drainage, such as a hairdresser or foot massage parlour, would pay more than the 30+ tenants in the arcade doing printing business
or selling sports shoes.  The pool of potential tenants to this particular building would be reduced but the nature of the arcade
suggests that the reduction to that pool would be small.  Equally the difference in rental potential between the reduced pool and
the maximum pool is likely, on the available evidence, also to be small.  Mr Cheung’s figure of $123,000 in 2012 for the unit with
water and drainage seems unrealistic.  The actual rent achieved, with water, was $82,000.  Mr Cheung’s figure represents a 50%
increase because of additional drainage. Two years later, in 2014, Mrs Chan was receiving $98,000 a month.  This is clearly in the
same general range as Mr Siu calculated to be appropriate.  It should nonetheless be recognized that the unit with drainage is worth
more than without.  Thus, a small, possibly even token, increase would have been added to reflect this. 80.  In the course of the hearing the value of the defendant’s counterclaim was pared down from a small sum to a tiny sum.  All that
is now claimed is $1,600 for the cost of dismantling the illegal pipework installed in 2010.  Mr Chan’s evidence (for the IO) concerning
this invoice was unclear.  I dismiss the counterclaim with no order as to costs. 81.

At the end of the day, the Applicants cannot, on the facts alleged, have any public law right to occupy the land forever, especially
given that there have been numerous complaints and issues raised, and that there was no dispute that they have no title or any private
law right to the land in question. 28.  There is a suggestion that the applicants were genuinely aggrieved because the failure to register them as squatters in the 1982
survey meant that they would not receive any resettlement or compensation arrangements under the squatter hut policy.  I can only
say that if this is their real grievance, then it is not relevant to the present application for judicial review because it is neither

was real likelihood that DBS’ eventual agreed/taxed costs might be a substantial portion of or even more than the amount of the
Surplus Proceeds, especially when such costs were to be taxed on indemnity basis. In such circumstances and given the clear contemplation
that the Surplus Proceeds (derived from the Property that was charged to secure such costs before it was sold) should be used to
secure costs liability to DBS should it succeed at trial (which it eventually did), it is entirely appropriate for the Surplus Proceeds
to remain in court pending agreement between the parties on such costs or pending completion of the taxation procedure, and then

LAM MAN CHIU v. HONG KONG FLOURTECH LTD [2017] HKCFI 626; HCPI 1083/2006 (7 April 2017),"Cheng Nog Ying (former next friend and mother of the plaintiff) in person, present","8.  On this ground alone, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has abused the court’s process, which provides me with a sufficient ground
to exercise my discretion to dismiss the action.  I also note the defendant’s evidence that it will suffer prejudice if the trial
is to take place now. There are factual disputes in this case.  I agree with Mr Cheung’s general observation that, although the
witnesses had made witness statements, it will be difficult for them to recollect what happened back in 2003.  Mr Cheung mentioned
that Mr Tang Kim Kwong, who was an operation supervisor employed by a private investigation company, had passed away.  In Mr Tang’s
witness statement, he merely produced a VCD record of surveillance on the plaintiff on 29 April 2005.  I do not believe his death
would have any material impact on a trial so long as the VCD is still available.  However, I am more concerned about Mr Cheung’s
evidence that the defendant’s solicitors are no longer able to contact Mr Lai Wing Nin, one of the defendant’s witnesses who
had made a witness statement dated 16 June 2007.  Mr Lai was supposed to give evidence as to the availability of safety goggles and
that the plaintiff was seen wearing such goggles before the accident.  The defendant’s evidence on prejudice has not been challenged.
 In view of such evidence, I am satisfied that, if the case goes to trial now, the defendant will suffer material prejudice caused
by the plaintiff’s delay in prosecuting these proceedings.  Hence, there is more the reason why I ought to exercise my discretion
to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim. 9.  In the circumstances, I shall dismiss the action with costs in terms of the defendant’s summons.  As the plaintiff was once on
legal aid, to err on the safe side, I shall also order that the plaintiff’s own costs be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations. 10.  I shall also direct that, when this decision is handed down, a court interpreter should be arranged to be present in order to explain
this decision to the plaintiff, the Mother or both.",Date of Decision:  7 April 2017(Paul Lam SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/626.html,"Mr Kevin Cheung, instructed by Waller Ma Huang & Yeung, for the Defendant",kevin cheung,in person,,Waller Ma Huang & Yeung,defendant,0.0

Lau & Co,　assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the defendant","5.  I take some comfort for that view from the judgment of Lord Justice Widgery in R v Saville [1980] EWCA Crim 1;  [1981] 1 QB 12 (sitting I might add with Bridge LJ and Woolf J as he then was) when he found that the Crown Court had an inherent jurisdiction to
remedy mistakes in the record and from his reliance upon Rubin J in R v Michael [1976] QB 414, where Rubin J said: 6.  However, these were cases which were civil in nature and the authorities provided to this court have been in respect of the appellate
jurisdiction of the court. None of them stand on all fours with the matter before me but I do feel that on the facts of this case,
the same principles apply.  This was a mathematical error which should not have been made. 7.  That being said, this is an issue of the liberty of the individual.  It is not, as was the case before Widgery LJ, an “unimportant
matter”.  Albeit that it refers to just two months’ imprisonment, it is two months of someone’s life and liberty and to this
defendant it is very important indeed.  The issue is therefore whether I should exercise my discretion and amend the record to show
the true intention of the court, or, in the circumstances of this case, not do so.  The defendant left this court room on 27 March
2017 expecting to serve 6 years and 6 months in prison less any reduction she may earn by reason of her good behaviour.  This is
her first term of imprisonment although she has previously been the subject of Rehabilitation and DATC orders as well as probation.
 She is just 21 years old.  The sentences were ordered to be consecutive after taking into account the issue of totality of sentence.
 They were entirely separate offending.  Be that as it may, she expected a term of imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months.  It was
my error and whilst I do not resile from the sentence I intended she should serve, I do not feel in all the circumstances of this
case where there is just two months’ imprisonment at stake for a woman serving her first sentence of imprisonment after a very
difficult life, that it is appropriate to amend the record to reflect my true intent at that time.",Date of Hearing:　11 April 2017Date of Ruling:　11 April 2017,"(A P Campbell Moffat)

For the above reasons, I find that the prospects of success of the proposed amendment to be highly doubtful, if not hopeless. 66.  In his decision, the Registrar noted that apart from the 1st defendant’s amendment application, the matter was ready to be set down for trial.  Although I bear in mind that there remains pending
the 2nd defendant’s amendment application issued after the Registrar’s decision, I agree with the Registrar that if the amendment were
allowed, there would inevitably be substantial delay to the progress of this action. As explained above, that is a matter to be taken
into account as part of the overall circumstances of the case. 67.  Having regard to all of the circumstances, the proposed amendment should be refused.  I therefore dismissed the appeal.","CHAN YUN MUI

On the question of whether the applicant has been detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, there is nothing
in the evidence before the court to show that the Director is using the power of detention for any purposes other than for removal
of the applicant, or it has become apparent to the Director at any time that it would not be possible to effect the applicant’s
removal within a reasonable time.  The evidence shows that a removal order was issued against the applicant shortly after his discharge
from prison and, subject to the issuance of an emergency travel document by the Pakistani Consulate,the Director is in a position
to remove the applicant at any time thereafter.  There is nothing to suggest that the Director has failed to act with reasonable
diligence or expedition to effect the applicant’s removal.  It is also reasonable of the Director to take the view that the applicant
can be removed within a reasonable period of time.   In all the circumstances, I find that the applicant has been detained for a
period that is reasonable in all the circumstances, and his current detention is compliance with the Hardial Singh principles. 23.  None of the grounds relied upon by the applicant can justify the issue of a writ of habeas corpus in the present case.

As regards Mr Wong’s submission that in the present case Ricco was not out of pocket as a result of the Allotment, I am not attracted
by the same.  The Allotment was meant to result in a larger capital base for Ricco.  That purpose was not achieved, and as pointed
out by Ms Law, the trading partners and creditors of Ricco might have been misled by the Allotment exercise. 19.  Finally, Mr Wong has urged the court not to dispose of these matters in a summary manner.  The answer is that there is no material
factual dispute which may justify a full trial. 20.  For these reason, I hold that the Allotment was in breach of s.47A of the Ordinance.  I shall hear the parties on the appropriate

the delay was perhaps due to the fact that the appellant was an inmate and appointment had to be made and arrangement done in order

set out in paragraphs 11 – 13 above.  Clause 19 showed that the Pledgee was not denying the title of the Pledgor over the Pledged
Shares but only claimed to be entitled to retain the Pledged Shares as security for the loan.  In any case, the Sum represented security
for payment of all obligations in full.  Defence (c) was unsustainable. 37.  The conditions in Order 29, rule 6 having been complied with, the Pledgor was plainly entitled to the return of the Pledged Shares.

the stay application involved no dispute of fact and was based on “settled” and “entrenched” law so much so that the plaintiff
should even be deprived of the opportunity to file evidence.  I disallow the engagement of senior counsel as unreasonable and substitute
it with a hypothetical junior in the costs assessment. 22.  The plaintiff’s affirmation in relation to the issue of costs was mostly a regurgitation of the correspondence.  It triggered
a lengthy response from the defendant, also with much reference to the correspondence. The plaintiff has caused costs to escalate
out of proportion to the original procedural step of a stay.  Had the stay application been adjourned for substantive arguments,
the costs (even with senior counsel) should not have exceeded $300,000 on party-and-party basis.  The indemnity costs now sought
for an application that has been withdrawn was totally unreasonable, in my view, and the plaintiff has contributed substantially
to it after the call over in January. 23.  Accordingly, though I award indemnity costs to the defendant, I take into account proportionality as if the solicitors had sensibly
dealt with the matter.  I award a sum of $230,000 to the plaintiff.",(Queeny Au-Yeung)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/761.html,"Mr Toby Brown, instructed by Kennedys, for the plaintiff",toby brown,ross li,Hastings & Co.,Kennedys,plaintiff,1.0

all factors into consideration, including those factors above. 10.  In the circumstances, taking a broad brush approach, the appropriate costs order for the application should be costs in the cause.
 The costs for today can be regarded as wasted costs, given rise by no response of P’s solicitors to D’s letters in February
this year.  I was told by counsel for D that she only received instructions to act for D in April.  If P had responded positively,
there is simply no need to have the hearing today.  Although I accept that even if the hearing proceeds today, the costs that D will
obtain should be costs in the cause on a party to party basis, I will not award costs to P because this was caused by P’s solicitors’
conduct. D’s conduct of non-compliance with the court’s order for failing to serve the supporting affidavit, though not directly
relevant to the hearing today because P had not raised it as the reason for no response to D’s letters, such misconduct has to
be taken into account as well under O.62, r.5.  I therefore order that there should be no order as to costs for today’s hearing.
 As such, it is not necessary for me to consider whether there should be counsel’s certificate for this hearing. 11.

I have no basis to find that the Defendant had in any way knowingly encouraged the Plaintiff’s mistake, or that it was unconscionable
for the Defendant to let the Plaintiff remain deluded, or to take advantage of the Plaintiff’s “mistake”. 54.  For all the above reasons, I conclude that there is no basis to grant any of the relief sought by the Plaintiff, and accordingly

was some vague suggestion that procedurally he might not be entitled to discovery that is available in Hong Kong.  However, it has
not been shown that discovery is not available in Switzerland.  I am by no means satisfied that Mr Bossard would suffer any procedural
disadvantage by having the dispute decided by the Swiss court. 53.  Physically, he would not be inconvenienced as he lives in Switzerland.  In so far as it was suggested that Swiss court fees are
significant compared to Hong Kong court fees, any such disadvantage would pale into insignificance given the notoriously high litigation
costs involved in any Hong Kong litigation.  54.

 In fact the debtor has taken out a summons in the Court of Appeal in HCMP 1061/2017 dated 8 May 2017 for leave to appeal. 14.  In any event I see no merit in the application.  Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the debtor’s affirmation raise no substantial point.  Paragraphs
5 to 25 appear to seek to challenge my conclusions as to the facts, but I do not discern any legitimate basis.  Within them, paragraphs
18 to 20 complain about a letter which was exhibited to a later affidavit of the petitioner.  However, as recorded in footnote 6
in my decision, I had specifically allowed that letter to be produced, and the debtor was cross‑examined on it.  Paragraphs 26
to 33 again seek to challenge my findings of fact, without any promising basis.  Paragraphs 34, 37 to 39 allege “bad faith” on
the part of the petitioner in other matters which are irrelevant for present purposes.  Paragraphs 35–36 and 40 raise no reason
against my costs decision.  Paragraphs 41 to 45 simply reiterate there are errors in my factual conclusions, without offering any
ground with realistic prospect of success. 15.  Given that each of the petitioner and debtor has failed in her application, taking a global view and broadbrush approach, and having
regard in particular to the history of the disputes between the parties, instead of ordering costs to follow the respective events,

contact with the Children since the Removal.  The Children now both object to return to Korea. The Son is of an age and maturity

they would have set this out in writing.  The present position is no different in that regard from when the matter was before the

is ketamine in HKSAR v Chan Ka-yiu, HCCC 143/2015, 19 May 2016, unreported, at paragraphs 18 to 39.  I will enhance the sentence in the present case by 6 months’
imprisonment.  The starting point currently stands at 12 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.   15.  At the time of the defendant’s arrest, she cooperated with the Customs officers.  This was acknowledged by the Customs officers
at trial.  She participated in a series of controlled delivery operations and later answered questions in a video recorded interview.
 Although the controlled delivery operations were not successful, the fact remains that she cooperated and assisted Customs officers
in the further investigation of this case.  She made a number of phone and WhatsApp messages to the person she claimed was to collect
the parcel and to the person who arranged the delivery. She participated in three controlled delivery operations.  On the issue of
assistance to the authorities, I have not held against her the fact that she sent a message to a friend and deleted messages.  She
revealed both matters to Customs officers when asked about them.  I will therefore reduce her sentence for the assistance that she
rendered the authorities by 9 months.  This brings the starting point to 11 years and 9 months’ imprisonment.  16.

For the reasons below, I consider that there are special circumstances in this case such that the applicants should be required
to pay the putative respondent’s costs: 3.  I would however exclude the costs of the hearing on 13 March 2017 which concerned the applicants’ application for leave to file
further evidence.  It seems to me that on the stance taken by the putative respondent to that application their attendance was largely
unnecessary. 4.  There will therefore be an order that the applicants do pay the putative respondent’s costs of and relating to the application
for leave to apply for judicial review after the Initial Response but excluding the costs of the hearing of the application to adduce
further evidence on 13 March 2017.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/904.html,"Written submissions by Ms Lorinda Lau and Mr Forest Fong, instructed by Chow Wong & Lawyers, for the Applicants",forest fong,anthony chan,Department of Justice,Chow Wong & Lawyers,unknown,

SONG LIAN ZHONG AND OTHERS v.

It was also pointed out that there is no application on the part of Samson to seek a rescission of the agreement to invest.  In
other words he would continue to hold the 3% shareholding and therefore on that basis it is inappropriate to order damages in the
sum of RMB 130 million to be paid to Samson.  The issue is whether an order for damages to be assessed should be given in light of
the absence of any evidence at this trial. 118.  Based on the evidence and arguments before the court, Samson should not be entitled to the return of the RMB 130 million in its
primary prayer for relief.  Samson is the beneficial owner of the 3% shareholding in CNTG BVI in return for its RMB 130 million investment.
 Whilst the misrepresentation may have caused Samson to make such investment, on balance, in the light of his willingness to acquire
0.5% interest at RMB 30 million in the absence of the Buyback Representation and in the absence of evidence to ascertain the value
of the 3% shareholding, the relief sought by Samson for damages to be assessed is dismissed.  The defendants pointed out that the
monetary disputes regarding the use of funds and the value of the business is dealt with in the BVI proceeding.  The BVI proceeding
is the proper forum for such quantification and valuation exercise to be done.  The 2nd plaintiff has failed to establish that an order be granted for damages to be assessed in this action. 119.  Costs should follow the event and the defendants are to bear and pay the plaintiffs’ costs, to be taxed if not agreed.","Dates of Hearing: 25 – 29 July, 1 – 5 and 8 – 11 August 2016Date of Judgment: 23 May 2017","(Teresa Cheng SC)

of which were contained in an express undertaking to this Court,  when the management of the Companies had already formed the intention
not to comply with material parts of the undertaking was an affront to the Court and in these circumstances it was appropriate for
this Court to signify its displeasure with the Companies’ conduct by ordering costs on an indemnity basis: see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2017, vol 1, para 62/App/12.  HSBC further argues that it is not necessary for the Court to conclude that it was likely that this would
have been sufficient to lead to the dismissal of the summonses, it is sufficient for the Court to take note of the Companies’ conduct

Had I been satisfied that the evidence to be adduced by the prosecution provided the basis for the jury to consider whether the
proposed added particulars substantially caused the death of the deceased, the delay in the application for amendment would have
caused injustice to the defence.  The particulars of the original indictment had nothing to do with “post-infusion management”.
 The inclusion of the proposed new particulars would have necessitated the defence team to shift or to re-focus their case to meet
the added allegation.  Whilst an adjournment would have given the defence time to prepare, in view of the fact that this case was
set down back in 2016, it would have been extremely difficult to find new trial dates should there be an adjournment. 38.  In any event, Mr Wong had clearly indicated that D1 would not ask for an adjournment as justice delay is justice denied.  Mr Duncan
did not ask for an adjournment either.  Had I allowed the application to amend, the defence team of D1 and D3 would have been forced
to deal with the new area while the trial is going on.  It would have been most unfair to the defence. 39.  For these reasons, I refused the application of the prosecution to amend the indictment.","MAK Wan-ling

Order of unspecified period under section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.

very high, and the enhancement for the international element may bring the sentence to a level where it is not just and proportionate
to the overall culpability of the offender’s conduct, I impose a starting point of 24 years’ imprisonment which I will reduce

subject of Count 1.  He submits he has no money and no property in Hong Kong or elsewhere.  I do not accept this to be the case.
 He has been able to afford a team of lawyers, including senior counsel, throughout these proceedings.  From what I have before me,
substantial funds ended up in the defendant’s hands and bearing in mind the way he has carried out his criminal misdeeds through
corporate structures and nominees here and aboard, I am not of the view that he is impecunious as he claims.  In fact, from what
I have before me, it appears that substantial funds ended up with the defendant which had been transferred overseas.  189.  In my view, the stay application was wrongly brought.  There had not been full and proper compliance with section 65DA of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, Cap 221, where the defence were obliged to provide a copy of the documents or materials on which their expert based his opinion
or findings.  Furthermore, it appeared to me that documents were in the possession of the defence which on their face did not support
their application, and which had not been disclosed.  190.  The unnecessary and improper act or omission by or on behalf of the defendant was the bringing of the stay application when it was
clearly devoid of merit, and where documents were in possession of the defendant that did not support his application, and were not
disclosed by him.  I therefore order that the defendant pay the prosecution costs of and in relation to the stay application, to

I have given the question of costs anxious consideration.  The applicant by this application has caused the Law Society to reconsider
its decision and to investigate her complaint as she had initially sought.  She has nevertheless continued her challenge, and refined
her grounds of review.  She has unfortunately at times used extreme language and made unsubstantiated allegations in advancing her
grounds of review.  Her allegations against the Law Society of collusion and bias in relation to this complaint were unsubstantiated,
and quite frankly without foundation, bearing in mind the structure and the composition of the Council and the manner in which it
conducts its affairs and business.  99.  From my assessment of the case, I have no doubt that the Law Society initially stood its ground on principle but later in a genuine
effort to resolve the dispute with the applicant agreed to reconsider its decision.  The applicant has succeeded in identifying an
anomaly in the complaint handling procedures when a complaint is made against a Council member.  The Law Society has addressed the
matter in the present case, and no doubt it has general guidelines concerning conflict of interest and procedures for declaring an
interest in relation to its ordinary affairs and business.  It would seem to me that the Law Society needs to specifically address
this issue with appropriate guidelines and measures. However, the applicant has not been successful in advancing arguments against
the “fresh investigation”, and unfortunately has resorted to making allegations against the Law Society that are without foundation. 100.  Therefore, on the question of costs, I am inclined to award the applicant 60 percent of her costs. Such costs would be limited because
the applicant has acted in person but in any event she may have incurred costs of some sort.  I therefore make an order nisi that
the Law Society pay 60 percent of the applicant’s costs, to be taxed if not agreed.",Date of Hearing: 16 December 2016Date of Judgment: 31 May 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

and the order of priority. The latter is governed by rule 19 of the NCPR which is quite irrespective of whether or not the beneficial
interest in a residuary gift has fallen in upon administration of the estate. The suggestion that a residuary legatee/devisee cannot
seek a grant of representation because he has no beneficial interest before administration of the estate is complete would render
rule 19(ii)-(iv) of the NCPR would be meaningless. The whole purpose of seeking a grant of representation is to enable the estate
to be properly administered and distributed, so it is strange that the residuary legatee/devisee cannot seek such grant under rule
19 of the NCPR before the estate is administered and he acquires beneficial interest. By that time, he does not need a grant any
more. 118.  By reason of the above matters, the answer to the Priority Issue is plainly and obviously that upon the death of Lau Yue Kui, former
administrator of the Estate, LA with will annexed de bonis non in respect of the Estate should have been granted to D as a matter of priority, and P did not come within the categories under rule
19 of the NCPR. That being the case, P’s claim against D in the OS must be struck out and dismissed, and I so order. There is therefore
no need for any further directions hearing for the OS referred to in paragraph 12(e) above. 119.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. However, I bear in mind the Removal Issue was not considered at the Hearing
of the Summons, and I also note the further concerns referred to in Part II above. I therefore grant a costs order nisi as follows:","7th fong

On the question of costs, by reason of section 43(1)-(2) of the HCO and Order 62 rule 3(12) of the RHC, the starting point is that the person against whom pre-action discovery is sought (eg D) is entitled to a costs order in his favour. But it had been said that “[where] the person against
whom an order is sought is at fault, eg where he has been dilatory in replying to a proper request to disclose documents, the court
may deny him his costs, or, in exceptional cases, order him to pay the applicant’s costs of the application”.[37] 57.  Here, NF made 2 requests to D on 17 May 2016 and 10 March 2017 for the Requested Documents, but there was no reply from him. D even
filed notice of intention to defend after the OS was served on him, but did not file any evidence in opposition. At the Hearing,
he also raised objection to the reliefs sought in the OS. In the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to grant a costs order
nisi that (a) there be no order as to costs of and occasioned by the OS (including all costs reserved if any), and (b) P’s own costs
to be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations. 58.  Should D require translation of this Judgment into punti language, he can contact my clerk to arrange an appointment for a court

For these reasons, I am of the view that the Injunction Order should not be continued.  Nevertheless, I recognise that the plaintiff

Order, in order not to prejudice the plaintiff’s position in the event that I be wrong in my conclusion on the lack of evidence
of a risk of dissipation, I would allow the Injunction Order to continue until the expiry of 14 days from the date of this decision,
leaving the plaintiff the usual period to consider what, if any, applications he may wish to make arising from this decision.   37. I also make an order nisi that the plaintiff should pay the defendants the costs occasioned to them by the application, to be taxed if not agreed, with a certificate

I may add that the view of BVI law taken in Waddington seems to be consistent with the decision of Eder J of the BVI High Court in Iu Chung v Greater Achieve Ltd (Claim No BVIHC (Com) 140 of 2015) on 28 June 2016.  In that case, the company in which the plaintiffs held shares and its direct
wholly‑owned subsidiary whose assets were allegedly misappropriated by the wrongdoers were both BVI companies.  The statement of
claim pleading a double derivative claim was struck out on various grounds.  The relevant ground for present purposes was stated
in paras 15 and 16 of the decision, where Eder J said: 17.  It seems to me that the judge had at least assumed that a double derivative action was possible in BVI law.  The source of the requirement
of permission referred to by Eder J is not clear from the decision and (assuming it is not s 184C) it is at least arguable that it
is a procedural requirement not applicable to a multiple derivative action brought in Hong Kong. 18.  For these reasons, I conclude that the 2nd defendant has not shown that it is plain and obvious that multiple derivative actions are not permissible in BVI law or that to bring
a multiple derivative action in relation to HK Wise Park it is necessary as a matter of substantive law for the plaintiff to obtain
the prior permission of the BVI High Court.  The application to strike out must therefore be dismissed.","TOP SUPER RESOURCES LIMITED

The response from Mr Wright is that whilst the evidence of the WhatsApp messages was served late, it is not material in the circumstances
of the case to the discount to be afforded to the defendant following his plea of guilty.  I agree with Mr Wright’s submission.
 11.  The WhatsApp messages were clearly known to the defendant and there was always the possibility of them being relied upon by the
prosecution in the case against him.  The defendant made an informed choice to enter a plea of not guilty which he maintained until
after his case was listed for trial.  He was aware of the WhatsApp messages and of his involvement in the crime to which he has admitted.
  The issue in relation to the discount he is to receive is dependent upon the stage of the proceedings that he has entered his plea
of guilty.  A sentencing court has an overriding discretion but there has to be very good reason to adjust the percentage discounts
from those now laid down in Ngo Van Nam.  I see no reason not to follow Ngo Van Nam, and accordingly in the circumstances of this case I will afford the defendant a discount of 25 percent.  12.

RE TANG YAT CHEUNG [2017] HKCFI 1431; HCB 5436/2014 (1 June 2017),"Wong Ka Sek and Wong Ka Lam King, The Joint and Several Trustees of the 
	property of Bankrupt: Mr Wong Ka Lam King, appeared in person","10.  The trustees also allowed him rent in the sum of $4,500, despite that he is living rent free in his wife’s accommodation.  That
would have allowed him to contribute to his wife’s mortgage repayment, if any, or provided him something to give to his wife as
a loving gesture from a dutiful husband for sharing in her flat. 11.  On the whole, I consider the trustees’ approach of the trustees unreproachable.  They promised to reassess the allowance and to
consider any reasonable ad hoc expenses on production of documentary evidence. In my view, the allowance is reasonable for a person
who has a financial burden to bear.  But, in all fairness to the bankrupt, the allowance may not be as generous as a person of his
income would like to be restrained from spending.  However, if one unfortunately becomes a bankrupt, when managing his financial
affairs, he must bear in mind the principle that one must be just before generous. He has not been prudent in managing his financial
affairs which landed him in bankruptcy.  By reason of the bankruptcy proceedings, his debts are forgiven.  He is allowed to begin
his financial affairs afresh, while his creditors are made to suffer for his impecuniosity.  But all that the law requires of him
is to subject himself to some discipline in his financial management for a few years, pay what he can reasonably afford to pay like
a responsible adult and to instill in himself a sense of responsibility in his financial affairs so that he would not fall again.
 If he is to be allowed to keep and spend all his income and to contribute only a nominal amount to repay his debt, it would be unjust
to his creditors.  Hence, I consider the expenses assessed by the trustees reasonable. 12.  However, in the present case, the bankrupt has found a new employment which almost doubled his past income.  He should be encouraged
to take a more positive attitude in life by being allowed to keep some of the fruits of his effort.  While the trustees have allowed
him $1,900, I think there is room for further increase as the position of the creditors has improved in the past two years as a result
of his effort.  I would therefore revise his monthly allowance to $16,000, but only with immediate effect.  To increase beyond that
level would be unjust to the creditors.","Management fee

The defendant has admitted that on 13 September 2016 he unlawfully trafficked in a dangerous drug, namely 288 g of a crystalline
solid containing 280 g of methamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as Ice, by bringing the drugs into Hong Kong at the Lok Ma
Chau Control Point.  The estimated retail value of the drugs at the time of the offence was $104,544.  He was stopped by police officers
who searched him and found the drugs secreted in a pocket of his underpants.  He admitted to the police officers that on that day
he had been given the Ice by a person named Ah Hing in Haifeng in mainland China who told him to wear the underpants so as to conceal
the Ice and take it to Shui Yeh in Hong Kong.  He explained that he owed Ah Hing $7,000 who suggested to him that he could set off
$5,000 of the amount that he owed him by making the delivery of the drugs.  He agreed to do it.  He also admitted that he has been
taking Ice for about half a year prior to this offence. 3.  The defendant is 33 years of age.  He was born in Haifeng in mainland China.  I am told that his family moved to Hong Kong in 1997.
 He later joined them about 3 years ago.  He has attained secondary school education to Form 3 level in mainland China.  At the time
of the offence he was living with his family and employed as a jewelry worker.  The defendant is married with a six-month old son.
 His wife and child live in mainland China.  It appears he maintains two homes, one in Hong Kong and one in mainland China.  He has
a clear record in Hong Kong.  4.  According to the sentencing guideline cases of AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125 and HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691, for trafficking in Ice, a starting point for a quantity of 280 g of Ice within the indicated tariff band is 14 years and 8 months’
imprisonment.  There is also an international element due to the fact that the defendant brought drugs into Hong Kong from mainland
China.  As provided by HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKC 197 and HKSAR v Chung Ping Kun, CACC 85/2014, 2 July 2014, this warrants an enhancement on the defendant’s sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment.  This brings
the starting point to 15 years and 2 months’ imprisonment.  As the defendant is entitled to a full one third discount, I will reduce
his sentence to 10 years’ imprisonment. ",vZHENG Yicun (鄭壹村),(Kevin Zervos) Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/976.html,"Mr Gary Leung, SPP of Department of Justice, for HKSAR",gary leung,david ma,"Cheung & Liu, Solicitors",,defendant,0.0

SH v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION AND ANOTHER [2017] HKCFI 1814; [2017] 6 HKC 22; HCAL 59/2015 (6 June 2017),"Mr Hew Yang Wahn, Counsel instructed by Secretary for Justice, for the 1st respondent","33.  I tend to agree with Mr Hew that not any fresh evidence raised on appeal would call for an oral hearing.  It all depends on whether,
in the mind of the Adjudicator, further probing is necessary and whether such so‑called fresh evidence is just more or less the
same as what was advanced before the Director.  In the present case, whilst the “new evidence” ground on its own may not succeed,
I am of the view that since the Adjudicator found against the applicant’s credibility which led him to conclude that the applicant’s
claim was unsubstantiated, the high standards of fairness required by Prabakar call for the Adjudicator to give the applicant an opportunity at an oral hearing to deal with those matters which were troubling
in his mind, before he decided the petition. 34.  In the absence of oral hearing before the Adjudicator, I find that there was a failure to meet the high standard of fairness.  I
allow SH’s application for judicial review against the Board’s decision but reject his application in respect of the Director’s
decision.  I grant a certiorari to quash the decision of the TCAB and order the matter be remitted to the TCAB for re‑consideration by another Adjudicator.  I
also direct the case to be heard expeditiously. 35.  I make an order nisi that the Director and the Board shall pay 50% of SH’s costs of these proceedings, to be taxed on a party to party basis if not
agreed, with certificate for counsel.  The deduction is made on the basis that the application in respect of the Board succeeded
but failed in respect of the Director.

This issue of conflict is indeed relied on as a major foundation for the removal application and may need to be dealt with when that
application is determined.  But the receivers had already in recent correspondence undertaken that they “will not cast any votes
within or on behalf of CSI which would lead to any dilution of CSI’s shareholding in CSCG”.  Further, as Mr Barlow SC pointed
out, while there had been proposals for the offer or placement of shares since the beginning of the receivership, none had been proposed
on the basis that no shareholders’ approval would be necessary.  He further submitted that if indeed a proposal is made to exercise

four elements enunciated in Adomako.  I only came to the view that the test for the last element is different in HK from that of UK as a result of the CFA in Sin Kam Wah overruling Chau Ming Cheong. 35.  For these reasons, I declined the invitation of the prosecution to depart from my earlier decision in Lai Shui Yin.  I ruled that in the present case, the test for the last element was the same as what I have ruled in Lai Shui Yin, ie the test for gross negligence was not only an objective reasonable man test, but the prosecution is required to prove that the
defendant’s subjective state of mind was culpable, that the defendant was subjectively aware of the obvious and serious risk of
death to the deceased. 36.  I will add here that the test should be the same for anyone facing a charge of GNM.  It makes no difference that the GNM in this

 The key distinction is said to be between cases where there is an immediate loss of value of some asset or interest in an asset

which may or may not lead to loss in the future: see Jackson & Powell, Professional Liability, 8th ed, §5-045.  But it is not an issue that requires resolution at this hearing.  26.

For all of the above reasons, I granted the orders at paragraph 11 above at the Hearing. I should add as a final caveat that these
reasons for decision should serve as a reminder to all litigants and practitioners that courts take a dim view of late applications
to move milestone dates. In the post-CJR culture, parties and their lawyers should be frank and upfront on any matter that may potentially affect milestone events so
that the court seized of the matter can evaluate the situation and decide how best to balance the parties’ interests as well the
deployment of court’s resources. The prism is triangular, and it is not for a party to dictate the outcome by withholding information.
In future, litigants should not expect the courts to smile with like kindness as in the present case, and they may have to suffer
the consequences of their own tactical manoeuvres. In a slightly different context (but also in the exercise of the court’s broad
discretion on case management, Ng J (as approved by the Court of Appeal) in In the matter of James Henry Ting made clear unsatisfactory and tactical delay is a material factor that may sway the exercise of discretion against the applicant. 90.  On 16 June 2017, Ps’ solicitors wrote to the court to request inter alia for (a) the trial to be re-fixed in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (b) extension of time to submit Ps’
statement of costs. It was said that if it is possible to re-fix the trial in consultation with the diary of Ps’ existing counsel,
then some costs thrown away may be saved. In my view, this proposal would not cause Ds any prejudice since (i) it would be Ps who
may suffer some delay if the re-fixed trial is to accommodate the diary of Ps’ existing counsel, and (ii) saving some costs thrown
away will only benefit Ds who are liable to pay such costs. It is also appropriate to extend time for Ps to lodge their statement
of costs since they cannot prepare their statement of costs until it is known whether Ps are able to retain their existing counsel
upon re-fixing the trial and thereby save some costs. 91.  In the circumstances, on 16 June 2017, I granted the following directions on paper as follows:",Date of Decision: 13 June 2017Date of Handing Down Reasons for Decision: 19 June 2017,"(Marlene Ng)

Having come to the conclusion that the discretion to depart from the usual rule on costs is engaged on the facts of this case, because
the facts of this case fell within consideration number (2.), and I decide to exercise my discretion to deprive the defendant as
to costs, the question then becomes how much.  25.  Mr Suen, first of all, asked me to deprive the defendant of 100 per cent of its costs.  At the hearing, he modified it to 50 per
cent.  In the exercise of my discretion, having taken into account the view formed by the court on the witnesses, the time taken
in court, and as to the overlap of certain witnesses’ testimony with other issues, I have decided to deprive the defendant of 25
per cent of its costs of the action, and therefore I order that the defendant is to have 75 per cent of its costs of the action,
and that includes the counterclaim, to be taxed if not agreed, and I give certificate for two counsel because I believe that this
is a case which justifies attendance of two counsel.  26.  In my judgment, this costs argument cannot be viewed in the same way as considering who is the successful party in an action, and
therefore it cannot be said that simply because the defendant managed to get a cheque from the plaintiff in terms of costs, it is
therefore the successful party.  The reality of the matter is that both parties have to come to court because they cannot agree on
the principle in relation to awarding costs, and therefore in the exercise of my discretion, I believe the fairest order to make

The plaintiff commenced the present action by way of an originating summons in the expedited form (Form 10), instead of the general
form (Form 8).  The plaintiff accepts that, under Order 7, rule 2(1) of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A, the expedited form should only be used if “authorized or required”, and the expedited form is neither authorized nor
required to be used for commencing the present action.  Accordingly, the plaintiff took out a summons dated 19 June 2017 seeking
to correct this irregularity.  In view of the conclusion that I have reached that the declaration sought should not be granted, plainly
the court should not grant any relief under the summons. 18.  The court has, for many years, been drawing practitioners’ attention to the fact the expedited form of the originating summons
should be used only where authorized or required, and that in many cases the expedited form has been wrongly used (see, for example,
the decision of Godfrey J (as he then was) in Hong Kong Ping Jeng Lau Co Ltd v The Incorporated Owners of United Centre, HCMP 2971 of 1989, given on 4 December 1989, and more recently the decision of DHCJ Paul Lam SC in International Automotive Components Group v Xuke Trading Limited, HCMP 564/2017, given on 19 April 2017).  Despite the court’s reminders, the same mistake has kept being repeated.  It must be
emphasised that rules of court are meant to be observed.  It should not be assumed that the court will readily overlook breaches
of the rule regarding the correct form of the originating summons to be used for commencing an action even if it can be said that
no prejudice is suffered by the opposite party as a result of the use of the incorrect form. This is because the use of the correct
form of the originating summons carries implications beyond the mere form of the document, including the timetable for the filing
of evidence and the fixing of the date of hearing of the originating summons. 19.  For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s originating summons dated 22 May 2017 and summons dated 19 June 2017 are dismissed.

this until I pointed it out during the hearing.  All the more surprising that Dr. Ko’s expert report was available as early as
19 August 2014.  I would have expected that the plaintiff should have taken steps mentioned in paragraphs 23 to 25 above, or discontinued
the claim then. 69.  The plaintiff’s claim for damages in this proceedings should be dismissed.  There be an order nisi for cost of the action to be

WO CHUN WAH v. CHAU KWEI YIN AND OTHERS [2017] HKCFI 1131; HCPI 903/2014 (23 June 2017),"The 2nd Defendant in person, present.","56.  To sum up, as the Plaintiff inflated his claim, and it was reasonable and necessary for the Board to participate in this action.
Its attitude in the proceedings was impartial, which is beyond reproach. The settlement agreement reached between the Board and the
Plaintiff and my assessments were mainly based on the authorities and arguments put forward by the Board. In my view, the Board only
played a filtering role, and its participation assisted the court in arriving at a correct assessment and also accorded with public
interest and justice. Having considered the circumstances of this action as a whole and balancing the Plaintiff’s interest with
public interest, I conclude that it is not proper to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. The Board performed its function
by screening out unreasonable claims; on the contrary, the Plaintiff seriously inflated his claim. In such circumstances, it is wholly
unreasonable to order the Board to pay the Plaintiff’s costs. Therefore, I make no order as to costs, and each party shall bear
its own costs. 57.  In summary, I find that the Plaintiff was an employee of the 2nd Defendant and that the Plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result of the 2nd Defendant’s breach of duty of care. I find that the 2nd Defendant is liable to pay to the Plaintiff damages of $1,428,547 together with interest on the principal of $1,395,309 at the rate
of 2% per annum from 18 November 2014 to the date of this judgment, and interest on the principal of $33,238 at half of the judgment
rate from 1 June 2013 to the date of this judgment, and thereafter interest on the outstanding principal at judgment rate until payment. 58.  Turning to costs, I order that the 2nd Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff’s costs, such costs to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations, and that there be no order as to costs between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant.",Date of Judgment: 23 June 2017(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/1131.html,"Mr Patrick Szeto, instructed by Kenneth Lam, Solicitors, assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the Plaintiff.",patrick szeto,in person,,"Kenneth Lam, Solicitors",plaintiff,1.0

The 1st Defendant has also issued contribution and indemnity notice against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.  The 1st Defendant asks for full indemnity of the Plaintiff’s claim on the ground that the accident was directly caused by the negligence
of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. 91.  I disagree that there should be full indemnity. Although the 2nd Defendant is liable for the accident for pressing the wrong button of which the 3rd Defendant is vicariously liable, the 1st Defendant remained the direct employer of the Plaintiff.  As the employer, it had a non-delegable duty to provide a safe system and
a safe place of work for the Plaintiff.  If the 1st Defendant had discharged such duty, the accident could have been avoided.  Judging the blameworthiness of the parties, the 1st Defendant on the one hand and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants on the other should bear equal responsibility for the accident.  I therefore hold that the 1st Defendant is entitled to claim 50% contribution from the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim. 92.

of the case.  Where I respectfully differ with the Magistrate, is in relation to the starting point imposed on each charge.  12.  I would impose a starting point on Charge 1 of 3 months’ imprisonment, on Charge 2 of 6 months’ imprisonment and on Charge 3
of 4 months’ imprisonment.  Like the Magistrate, I would reduce the sentence on each charge by one third for the appellant’s
guilty plea, bringing the sentence on Charge 1 to 2 months’ imprisonment, on Charge 2 to 4 months’ imprisonment and on Charge
3 to 2 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment.  I would further reduce the sentence on each Charge for the restitution that has been
made by the appellant, resulting in a sentence on Charge 1 to 1 month and 2 weeks’ imprisonment, on Charge 2 to 3 months and 1
week’s imprisonment and on Charge 3 to 2 months’ imprisonment.  Taking into account the totality principle, I too, like the Magistrate,

was poor and how the material was inferior.  As noted, the statement of the expert was admitted into evidence by having her statement
read out in open court and therefore was not the subject of cross-examination.  Whilst the expert could have explained in greater
detail the lack of quality of the handbag in arriving at her conclusion, it is the case that she is familiar with Chanel products
and its quality, and has identified by the poor workmanship and inferior material that it is not one of their products.  18.  I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before the Magistrate, including the admission the appellant made at the time of her
arrest that this was a “highly imitated” handbag, the nature and circumstances of the transaction, the price difference between
the genuine handbag and the handbag sold by the appellant, and the expert evidence that this was not a genuine Chanel handbag, that
this supports to the requisite standard the conviction in question. 19.  The appeal is therefore dismissed. ",Date of Hearing: 27 June 2017Date of Judgment: 27 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

 Harwood, for the 1st to 4th defendants","79.  As I have explained in the earlier part of this decision, CSI does not carry on any business, other than holding the Shares as an
investment.  The appointment of independent receivers, to exercise the voting and other rights of a shareholder in the interim of
the determination of the dispute between Chen and the Defendants in the Arbitration, is not draconian and in fact serves to preserve
the value of the Shares.  It should also conserve the subject matter of the Arbitration, assisting to ensure that the arbitral process
is not frustrated in its final stages, should Chen’s claims to the Shares succeed but the Shares have been transferred to and registered
in someone else’s name, and the voting rights lost. 80.  Having considered the entire circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the appointment of receivers to exercise the voting
and other rights in the Shares is an interim order that may be granted by the court in Hong Kong in relation to arbitral proceedings.
 Bearing in mind that the Shares are of a company in Hong Kong, the interim appointment of receivers of such Shares will facilitate
the process of the arbitral tribunal or the Mainland court that has primary jurisdiction over the Arbitration, and it is just for
the court to grant such an interim order to maintain and preserve the status quo. 81.  An order will be made in terms of paragraphs 1 to 3 and 4 of the Re-amended Originating Summons issued on 22 May 2017.  An order

There is also the question of D’s delay in making the application by the summons which is a factor to be taken into account. 
Wong said unconvincingly in his 1st affirmation that he only became aware of the judgment in September 2008.  Yeung also said unconvincingly in her 1st affirmation that she did not know of the judgment until shortly before the summons was issued.  Although there are disputed facts
as to when D became aware of the OS and the judgment, it is unlikely, in my view, that D only became aware of the judgment shortly
before the summons was issued.  There has obviously been delay in taking out the application.  Despite this, I am of the view that
the discretion to set aside the judgment should be exercised in favour of D.  I have found that defences with a real prospect of
success have been shown and in my view, it would be unjust not to set aside the judgment which was obtained by default without a

I have had submitted to me two letters.  One from the defendant who has expressed his remorse for what he has done.  He also stated
that he has joined a Christian group whilst in custody and he is keen to rehabilitate himself and lead a law abiding life in the
future.  The second letter comes from a minister of the Christian group who confirms the defendant’s participation in the group
and commitment to change his ways and rehabilitate himself.  I have carefully considered the information and material submitted to
me which I accept and will be as leniently as I possibly can when passing sentence on the defendant. 7.  According to the sentencing guideline cases of AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125 and HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691, for trafficking in Ice, a starting point for a quantity of 32.7 g of Ice within the indicated tariff band is 8 years and 6 months’
imprisonment.  There is also an international element due to the fact that the defendant brought drugs into Hong Kong from mainland
China.  As provided by HKSAR v Abdallah Anwar Abbas [2009] HKCA 115; [2009] 2 HKC 197 and HKSAR v Chung Ping Kun, CACC 85/2014, 2 July 2014, this warrants an enhancement on the defendant’s sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment.  This brings
the starting point to 8 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  As I have indicated, I will take into account the fact that the defendant
has not been in trouble with the law before and deserves to be treated leniently bearing in mind the mitigation that has been presented
on his behalf.  I will adopt a starting point of 8 years’ imprisonment.  8.  As the defendant is entitled to a full one third discount, I will reduce his sentence to 5 years and 4 months’ imprisonment. ",Date of Hearing: 28 June 2017Date of Sentence: 28 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

On the individual approach, the following calculation can be made.  The quantity of ketamine involved is 57.4 g and according to
the guidelines laid down in S for J v Hii Siew Cheng [2008] HKCA 200; [2009] 1 HKLRD 1, a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of cocaine involved is 5.42 g and according to the guidelines
laid down in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370, a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment is suggested.  The quantity of Ice involved is 6.21 g and according to the guidelines laid
down in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125, a sentence of 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  This would make a total sentence of 13 years and 6 months’ imprisonment
and obviously taking into account the totality principle, an adjustment downwards would need to be made. 9.  On the combined approach, most of the drugs were ketamine, and applying the sentencing guidelines for ketamine to the total quantity
of narcotic involved, which would be about 70 g, a sentence of 6 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is suggested.  The difficulty
I have with the combined approach is that for small quantities of cocaine and Ice, the sentencing tariff is higher than that for
ketamine.  There needs to be an adjustment.  The conversion is one way of doing it and I will be guided by it, but as indicated there
is a difference in the final sentence depending on which drug the total narcotic has been converted to which is then applied to its
sentencing tariff.  10.  I will impose a starting point, applying the conversion submitted by the prosecution, of 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment which
I will reduce by one third for the defendant’s early guilty plea to 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. ",Date of Hearing: 28 June 2017Date of Sentence: 28 June 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

As the second basis for seeking a variation, Mr Leung submits on behalf of Wen that there was no justification for making Wen a
party or for ordering costs against him.  I agree with Mr Ho that this argument is no longer open to Wen.  The issue was debated
at the substantive hearing on 1 March 2017 (and in the skeleton arguments for that hearing).  In my judgment I gave reasons at §27
dealing with those arguments and disposing of the issue.  In §28, I actually concluded there was basis for ordering Wen to pay costs.
It was on the quantum of costs awarded that I expressed my view on a provisional basis.  Even if I am technically not functus officio in relation to the question, I see no special reason why it should be re‑opened. 6.  Accordingly Wen’s application must be dismissed, with costs to Xing on a nisi basis (with a certificate for counsel insofar as necessary). 7.  I also direct that the sum of $350,000 previously paid by Xing into court as security for Wen’s and the Company’s costs be released
and paid out to Xing.  Although he was ordered to pay the costs of the application for security, the costs order in his favour in
the originating summons is likely to be sufficient to meet them.  Any other debts that may exist are not a ground for withholding
the sum from Xing which was paid into court only as security for the costs of these proceedings.","Date of Written Submissions: 6, 14 & 21 June 2017Date of Decision on Costs: 28 June 2017","(Godfrey Lam)

For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that in rejecting the review for the 64 items the master has erred in principle, has taken
into account irrelevant matters, and failed to take into account relevant matters.  53.  The appeal will accordingly be allowed.  The claim in the bill for two solicitors on each of the 64 items under objection is rejected.
 The amount of the bill, as taxed down by the master, is further taxed down to entitle the time claimed for one solicitor only. 54.  Mr Ho has succeeded entirely in the application for review of the master’s decision.

can be very expensive and risky, and parties should carefully weigh the risk against the potential benefit. 29.  I would consider the sum of HK$1,128,800 excessive for defendant’s costs in the action up to the parties’ exchange of witness
statements.  Having considered the nature of the case and the defendant’s skeleton bill of costs, I think that a reasonable sum
would be HK$350,000 to cover defendant’s costs up to the date of the trial.  This sum does not, of course, include the costs of

Turning to LRMJ–29 and 37, they are both documents bearing the 2nd defendant’s signature.  For LRMJ–29, the 2nd plaintiff says that the 1st defendant had told her it was not signed by the 2nd defendant, but by the girlfriend of Kong Pok‑man, and the signature is different from all the other known signatures of the 2nd defendant; see her 1st affirmation, paragraphs 87 to 89.  For LRMJ–37, the 2nd plaintiff says the 1st defendant forged it in her presence; see her 1st affirmation, paragraph 64.  The 1st defendant denies this; see her 1st affirmation paragraph 52.  It seems to me that if the signatures do indeed look very different, then perhaps an expert cannot add
very much. 10.  In any event, these documents are not in the summons, but only mentioned in the proposed directions of the plaintiffs lodged on
3 July 2017, so that, I think, to be fair, the 1st and 4th defendants should be given time to consider and respond to the application to adduce expert evidence on handwriting in relation to
them if necessary.  11.  The upshot, therefore, is that I grant the plaintiff’s application in relation to the five documents in the summons bearing the
1st defendant’s signature, or what appears to be the 1st defendant’s signature. I refuse the application in relation to LRMJ–7 and LRMJ–28, and the application in relation to LRMJ–29

RE DAYS INTERNATIONAL LTD [2017] HKCFI 1323; HCCW 299/2011 (14 July 2017),"Mr Justin Lam, instructed by Oldham, Li & Nie, for Global Empire Limited","2.  To cut a relatively complex story short, Global Empire’s claim relates to an alleged assignment of debt to it by the Dayarams
in connection with a company called Days International Limited.  The Dayarams were charged and convicted of fraud in relation to
the affairs of the company and in particular the circumstances in which the alleged debt was created.  3.  As my earlier decision explains, the circumstances in which it is suggested that Global Empire came to acquire the debt and indeed
the genuineness of the debt itself are, to put it at its lowest, highly questionable and given the conviction of the Dayarams and
the failure of their subsequent appeal, it is quite clear that the suggestion that Global Empire is owed any money by the company
as a result of the assignment is bound to fail. 4.  As a consequence, Global Empire has agreed to withdraw its summons appealing the liquidators’ decision and pay the costs, the
only issue is whether or not the costs should be paid on an indemnity basis as the liquidators seek.  It seems to me to be quite
clear that Global Empire’s appeal of the liquidators’ decision was pure chutzpah and it had no realistic prospect of success
and should never have been brought.  I will therefore order that the costs are assessed on an indemnity basis.",Date of Hearing: 14 July 2017Date of Decision: 14 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. SUN MIN [2017] HKCFI 1266; [2017] 4 HKLRD 211; HCMP 2236/2015 (17 July 2017),"Mr James Man, instructed by Reed Smith Richards Butler, for the defendant","17.  I had some concerns about whether or not an order that the Defendant pay to a counter party to a transaction who sold her shares
an amount assessed on the basis of the difference between the sale price and a valuation of the shares based on the price in the
market once the inside information became known to the market, was a windfall for the seller rather than restitutionary in nature
as section 213(2)(b) envisages. 18.  Mr Yu’s argument is that it is apparent from the inclusion of section 213(8), which allows damages to be claimed by the SFC on
behalf of a counter party to a transaction, that section 213(2)(b) is not concerned with compensating a counter party for any loss
caused to him or her.  Section 213(2)(b) requires the court to make the assumption that the counter party retained the shares and
ignore the sale.  On this assumption it is legitimate to calculate the amount to be paid by way of restitution by looking at what
the position of the counter party would have been if he or she had retained the shares and been in a position to sell them when the
share price rose. 19.  Whilst I understand the argument and accept that given the agreement of the parties the order sought in the present case is one
that can be made, and will accordingly make an order in the terms of the originating summons subject to certain minor changes in
the periods for payment, I must say that I harbour reservations about how section 213(2)(b) operates.  It does seem to me that section
213(2)(b) applied as explained by Mr Yu results in a defendant having to pay a sum that neither represents (a) disgorgement of profit
improperly made by the insider nor (b) restoration of loss suffered by another person trading in the shares as a consequence of the
insider’s conduct.  It seems to fall into a separate category, which I have difficulty in characterising.  As, however, the order
is agreed and I have not had the benefit of full argument before me I think it is best that I go no further.  It may be that this
is an issue, which will come back before the court at some time in the future in circumstances in which it can be more fully considered.",Date of Decision: 30 June 2017Date of Reasons for Decision: 17 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

In conclusion, the IARB should have notified AIA that it was contemplating making a payment order against it in the same way that
it notified Mr Lau, advising him of the nature and likely consequences of the proceedings, informing him of his rights, and giving
him the opportunity to be heard on the matter, even the opportunity to elect an oral hearing if he wished to have one.  Similarly,
the Appeals Tribunal should have addressed the issue of “previous practice” as well as considering the factual dispute that had
been raised by the applicant in relation to the complainants’ dealings with the insurance agent.  These are matters that most likely
would have warranted an oral hearing.  128.  For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that a number of procedural irregularities took place before the IARB and the Appeals
Tribunal that violated fundamental principles of natural justice, as well as the requirements of Clause 39, and that the Appeals
Tribunal left unresolved various critical issues raised by the applicant.  In line with my judgment, I therefore make an order certiorari
quashing the decision of the 2nd respondent, including the payment order.  I remit the matter back to the Appeals Tribunal for rehearing and reach a decision according
to law and to any relevant comment in this judgment.  129.  It seems to me that on the question of costs the applicant should receive its costs, but I will require argument on the issue in

more prejudicial than probative.  However, he acknowledged in oral submissions that the identification evidence of the two police
officers was not of poor quality.  In any event, he lists a number of matters that he submits rendered the identification parade
evidence unreliable.  First, he argues that the identifications were made of a stranger.  That may be so, but both police officers
were greeted by Ah Moon and spent a considerable period of time with him in the lounge.  He chatted with them and entertained them
while they were there.  This was not a fleeting encounter.  Secondly, he complains that the two police officers were extremely precise
in their height estimates of the appellant.  One officer said he was 175-176 cm tall.  The other officer said he was 1.73 metres
tall.  He argues that appellant was the tallest, by about half a head, of the eight people used in the identification parade and
so therefore he stood out.  The participants in the identification parade were of varying heights, and whilst the appellant was the
tallest, the range of heights were not of a nature or degree that would render the identification parade unfair. Thirdly, he complains
that two of the actors were Filipinos and not Thai nationals like the appellant.  Whilst it is true that two of the actors were Filipinos,
their general appearance and characteristics was similar to the other participants in the identification parade.  It should be noted
that the other participants were Thai nationals.  But in any event what was important, as correctly noted by the magistrate, was
whether the actors reasonably resembled the appellant.  He was satisfied that the identification parade was fairly conducted and
I agree.  There is no substance to this ground of appeal. 16.  I have considered the evidence presented at trial and the issues before the magistrate, and I find no basis to interfere with the
magistrate’s verdict.  As this is a rehearing on the papers, I am satisfied to the requisite burden and standard of proof that
the appellant is guilty of the offences as charged.  17.  The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed. ",Date of Hearing: 21 July 2017Date of Judgment: 21 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

I note that the appellant pleaded guilty to the offence of using a copy of a false instrument, contrary to section 74 of the Crimes Ordinance.  The head sentence for such an offence is imprisonment for 14 years.  The magistrate applied the sentencing guidelines for an offence
contrary to section 7A of the Registration of Persons Ordinance which in the circumstances of the case was appropriate.  He noted that a proper sentence in such circumstances is one of 15 months’
imprisonment on a plea of guilty.  He correctly took the view that there was no difference in terms of culpability where a photocopy
of a forged identity card is used.  He accordingly imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment on the appellant for this offence.
 8.  The magistrate ordered that the terms of imprisonment on each offence run concurrently.  9.  I have considered the sentences imposed by the magistrate and his reasons for doing so and there is no basis for this Court to interfere

It was never pleaded in their defences or put
to the plaintiff in cross examination that he contrived to fall that morning or that he fell in a conscious or unconscious attempt
to achieve his goal of obtaining a less demanding post.  I refrain from making any findings of fact on these matters. All I would
say is that the evidence of the plaintiff’s history that I have set out above raises a grave suspicion that his fall was not accidental. 38.

This is a very simple application clearly in lack of merit. It is astonishing that the plaintiff found it necessary to file an affidavit
in opposition even in the absence of any supporting evidence filed by the relevant defendants. I have perused the affidavit not without
reluctance. With respect, it is of no assistance and it merely shows poor judgment on the part of the plaintiff’s legal advisors. 26.  The counsel brief is really modest. It was at the outset agreed that there should be paper disposal of the Variation Summons. Mr
Ng’s written submissions are capable of dealing with all the arguments advanced on behalf of the relevant defendants. The supporting
work to be undertaken by the plaintiff’s solicitors should be minimal. I believe 1.5 professional hours of the handling solicitor
and the like professional hours of his assistant solicitor would suffice. Accordingly, I only allow a total sum of HK$13,750 (HK$4,000
+ 6,000 + 3,750). 27.  In conclusion, the Variation Summons of the relevant defendants is dismissed and the relevant defendants should forthwith pay the

WONG MING SHEK, RICHARD [2017] HKCFI 1304; [2017] 4 HKLRD 505; HCCC 183/2017 (24 July 2017)","Mr Kwan Tong Lee, instructed by Sit, Fung, Kwong & Shum, assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the defendant","9.  I am prepared to accept in the circumstances of the present case that the defendant has been led astray by the influence of others,
and together with his immaturity of youth, has committed this crime.  I am of the view that in the special circumstances of his case,
rehabilitation of him is a matter of importance which warrants greater emphasis when passing sentence.  In light of the seriousness
of the offence and the sentencing guideline cases, a term of imprisonment is warranted.   10.  Cocaine and heroin are equated for sentencing purposes and the tariffs as fixed for heroin in R v Lau Tak Ming [1990] 2 HKLR 370 apply to cocaine.  This was confirmed in AG v Pedro Nel Rojas [1994] HKCA 54; [1994] 1 HKC 342.  According to the sentencing guidelines for the quantity of narcotic content involved of 69.65g of cocaine, the defendant is in the
band of 50 to 200 g, where the guideline starting point for traffickers after trial, subject to any enhancement, is 8 to 12 years’
imprisonment.  I will therefore adopt a starting point of 8 years and 6 months’ imprisonment which I will reduce by one third for
the defendant’s guilty plea to 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  As I have mentioned, I am of the view that there are special
circumstances in the defendant’s case, as highlighted by his background and youth, that warrant a further reduction in sentence
in order to serve the desirability of rehabilitation.  I will reduce his sentence to 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment.  11.  I note that the defendant is currently serving a detention centre order.  In accordance with section 7 of the Detention Centres Ordinance, Cap 239, such an order will lapse if the person is sentenced to a term of imprisonment which is not suspended.

The offence calls for a period of disqualification which for a first conviction should be not less than 6 months.  I therefore order
that the defendant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months.  This order is somewhat
meaningless in light of the substantial term of imprisonment that has been passed in relation to the drug trafficking offence. 11.  Ms Pauline Leung, on behalf of the defendant, has very helpfully taken me to the photographs of the scene where the defendant was
arrested which depicts the position and damage of the vehicles.  Whilst it would appear that it was not a significant collision between
the vehicles, it nevertheless was an attempt by the defendant to avoid apprehension which put the safety of the police officers at
risk.  As an aggravating factor to the circumstances of the drug trafficking offence, I would have enhanced the sentence by 2 months’
imprisonment.  However, as the defendant has been sentenced in relation to the two separate offences of dangerous driving and drug
trafficking, and taking into account the totality principle, I order that 2 months of the sentence on the dangerous driving offence
run consecutively to the sentence on the drug trafficking offence.  12.  The defendant is therefore sentenced to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearing: 24 July 2017Date of Sentence: 24 July 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

It is not suggested that either the 2016 or 2017 Orders are unclear or that there is much room for argument about what KPMG HK have
done, or not as the case may be, by way of compliance with them.  If the Liquidators, consider KPMG HK do not have a legitimate excuse
for non-compliance the appropriate course is to commence contempt proceedings. 12.  I also have another more practical objection to the way in which the Liquidators wish to progress the matter.  If I have to decide
the summonses on the basis of the evidence filed to date, which is Mr Manzoni’s preferred course, I cannot see how I could be expected
to do other than make an order substantially in the terms of the first part of paragraph 27 of the February Decision, which would
not advance the matter very far; although I note in passing that there may be a material difference in the position in respect of
the audit working papers for the financial years up to and including 2007, when the audit was done by the KPMG HK and from 2008,
when as I understand the position, KPMG Huazhen carried out the audit on the Mainland as a component auditor.  If the question of
KPMG HK’s ability to direct KPMG Huazhen to take such steps as are necessary for KPMG HK to comply with the 2016 and 2017 Orders
is going to have to be resolved by further evidence and possibly cross-examination, particularly, having regard to the importance
of the Liquidators having access to the Documents and the nature of KPMG HK’s reasons for failure to comply, this should be by
way of contempt proceedings. 13.  In conclusion I will dismiss the two summonses.  I will make a costs order nisi that the costs are paid out of the assets of the Company with a certificate for two counsel.",Date of Hearing: 6 July 2017Date of Decision: 26 July 2017,"(Jonathan Harris)

Yung & Co. assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the accused","21.  In my opinion, the impugned statement in paragraph 11 of the witness statement in the depositions of Ms Lui is not mere narrative.
 It is concerned with arrangements to pick up in Hong Kong drugs which had been packed on the mainland and to ensure that Ms Lui
understands the arrangements and the participants in the packing operation which were a prelude to its delivery.  In my judgement,
this is clearly a statement to advance the interests of the conspiracy. 22.  The only remaining question is whether the inability of counsel for the accused to cross-examine Fu Chai would be a proper basis
for the exclusion of the impugned passage.  I rather suspect that if Fu Chai was available, he would most likely be on the current
indictment as an accused and if that were the case his availability to the present accused for cross examination would depend on
exigencies of a joint trial and it would be by no means a sure thing that he would conduct his case in a manner which would expose
him to the cross examination of the present accused.  In my judgement the efficacy of cross-examining Fu Chai is a concept substantially
more apparent than real.  23.  Finally, in making the order that the impugned passage is admissible as an act or declaration in furtherance of the conspiracy,
I also make it plain that in the event that the evidence presents at trial in a manner which would mean that the factual underpinnings
of, in particular, my determination that there exist reasonable evidence that the impugned passage was an act or declaration in furtherance
of the conspiracy, were to fall away then I would be in duty bound to reconsider the ruling.  Subject to that qualification these
are my reasons for holding the impugned passage in paragraph 11 of the statement of Ms Lui to be admissible as an act or declaration
in furtherance of a conspiracy involving herself, the accused and Fu Chai.",Date of Ruling: 26 July 2017(Andrew Bruce SC),Deputy High Court Judge,/2017/2435.html,"Mr. Richard Donald, Counsel on fiat for Department of Justice, for the HKSAR",richard donald,jackson poon,,,unknown,

I also find it absurd for the Defendants to suggest that, if they were willing and prepared to repay the loans, the Plaintiff simply
ignored them and refused to provide them with the details for payment. 49.  Finally, it is trite law that there are conditions to be satisfied before the court would imply any terms in a contract.[6]  The principal test remains one of necessity, and the question to be answered is whether the term is necessary to give effect to
the intention of the parties or to achieve the parties’ objective in entering into the contract rather than whether it is necessary
to make the contract work at all.[7] It is clear that the rights and obligations between the Plaintiff (lender), the 1st Defendant (borrower) and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (guarantors) are well regulated by the terms of the contracts made between them, to be supplemented by various legal principles
under the law of surety and guarantee.  There is simply no room for the court to imply any further terms as contended for by the
Defendants in the relevant loan facilities agreements.  There is also no factual basis to support that the Plaintiff was in breach
of some of these alleged implied terms, for example, the Plaintiff or its predecessor had misrepresented the financial position between
the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant or the Plaintiff had made premature demands for repayment of debt.[8] 50.  For the above reasons, the Defendants have failed to establish any triable issues either as to liability or quantum, and Master
Ho was right in granting summary judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.  I therefore dismiss the appeal. I also make a costs order

I do not accept that the defendant was coached at all, at least not in the sense that any C&E officer told him what to say and
provided him with information about which the defendant had absolutely no prior knowledge.  Although it was not canvassed with any
of the officers, I accept it is possible that conversations took place in the intervening period, conversations which the defendant
alluded to in evidence and in which the defendant volunteered all sorts of information which was happily received by the C&E
team.  I say this because the defendant said he had spoken with C&E over those two days.  He is generally effusive.  He was effusive
in interview and in evidence.  It is difficult to control him once in full flow.  This can be seen on the VRI and was evident in
court.  It is possible that the defendant believes that anything he said during that time was the subject of what he likes to term
“coaching” whereas and in fact it was simply a one‑way flow of information which the C&E accepted and no doubt, urged him
to repeat under interview. 18.  I come to this view because the defendant made it clear under cross examination that he only gave in interview information he agreed
with (whether that was coached or not) and where he disagreed with it, he did not say it.  Two matters arise from that.  Firstly,
that he appears to have conceded that what he said was correct to his knowledge (although the issue of the truthfulness of his statements
is not to be decided upon here) and secondly, he chose when to comply with the provision of information to C&E and when not to.
 The first matter suggests that the information came directly from the defendant himself as the C&E could not have had such detailed
information within their own knowledge at that stage of the investigation and secondly, he acted wholly voluntarily.  Any inducement,
if made, was not operative, as he made it clear that he refused to say that he had knowledge as to the contents of the parcel which
he maintained is what the C&E wished him to do. 19.  Accordingly, I do not find that any admissions against interest made within the VRI VDP121, have been made involuntarily.  I find
the VRI Exh VDP109, VDP121a and VDP121b prima facie admissible subject to an application as to editing matters which are either submitted to be irrelevant or where their prejudicial
effect may outweigh their probative value.","CO 9892

On 9 June 2014, the Court of Appeal in HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 revised the sentencing tariffs for a person convicted of trafficking of Ice as contained in AG v Ching Kwong Hung [1991] 2 HKLR 125.  The narcotic content of Ice of 14.3 g falls within the band of 10 to 70 g where the sentence after trial ranges from 7 to 11 years’
imprisonment.  For this quantity of drugs, a starting point of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment is adopted.  10.  On 2 September 2016, the Court of Appeal revised the practice of affording discounts of sentence for guilty pleas in HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2016] HKCA 397; [2016] 5 HKLRD 1.  It was noted by the Court of Appeal that the revised practice would not apply in respect of cases in the Court of First Instance
where trial dates had already been fixed.  This case was fixed for trial on 23 May 2016 and therefore the previous practice applies.
 Under the previous practice, a defendant would usually be entitled to the normal one third discount when the plea of guilty was
entered on the first day of trial: HKSAR v Lo Chi Yip and Another [2000] HKCA 211; [2000] 3 HKLRD 270, 276C-277J; and HKSAR v Ting Chiu and Another [2003] HKCA 41; [2003] 3 HKLRD 378, [17], [21] to [23].  Accordingly, the defendant will be given the normal one third discount for his plea of guilty.  11.

to 4 years and 10 months’ imprisonment.",Date of Hearings: 27 June and 21 August 2017Date of Sentence: 21 August 2017,"(Kevin Zervos)

The final complaint relates to the lack of particulars for the fraud claim, which is mainly formulated in §§11, 12 and 23 of the

filed for the hearing of the striking out application, and so the Plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to deal such complaint
in the opposing affirmations.  In any event, assuming that the Plaintiff’s factual allegations were to be accepted by the court,
there is certainly a prima facie case that the Defendant had obtained money from the Plaintiff in a fraudulent manner.  If the Defendant thinks that insufficient
particulars have been included in the pleading, the proper way is for her to ask for further and better particulars in support of
such claim.  At this stage, the Plaintiff’s fraud claim is one capable of being pursued and so I refuse to strike out the fraud
claim pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim. 23.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the striking out application.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of the application, including the costs of the application for leave to adduce the Affirmations of Chieng and Mak,

view that the evidence adduced by the Mother is not sufficient to satisfy the high threshold for such kind of defence.  Firstly,
it is also always possible for the Mother to seek proper relief from the English court, including financial relief to enable her
to stay in the UK and appropriate access arrangement.  In respect of her right to stay in the UK, I am sure that the HK Central Authority
can liaise with the English Central Authority to make temporary arrangement to enable the Mother to stay in the UK for any matrimonial
proceedings if such need arises.  Secondly, it is not sufficient for the Mother to simply assert that she does not have the means
to stay in the UK.  The facts of the present case indicate that the parties might have obtained some financial assistance from their
families.  Hence, more materials need to be supplied to the court to substantiate her allegation about the lack of means to stay
in the UK for any matrimonial proceedings.  In any event, my ruling on such defence is now academic. 86.  Based on my finding on habitual residence, I refused the Father’s application for the return of the Child.  I now make a costs

I have previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Kwan JA in Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 in which the court concluded that if there is not sufficient evidence of constructive notice, it is unnecessary to consider if a
bank has taken reasonable steps to dispel constructive notice. 52.  While Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited v Tsang Sheung Bun [2013] HKCA 562; [2013] 5 HKLRD 62 was a matter that went to trial, I have also previously referred to the judgment of the Honourable Mr Justice Ng in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015, a matter decided on a summary basis, in which His Lordship rejected a defence of undue influence which he found was
based on bare assertions which were not believable, lacked precision or particulars and did not show the defendant has been “…
forced, tricked or misled …” into signing the subject documentation.  As I have observed, every such case is very much dependent on its own facts, but I would
echo what His Lordship said in Re Leung Lai Hing Cindy (the debtor)HCB 6777/2015. 53.  After considering all of the evidence and the circumstances, for the reasons set out in my judgment I do not view the evidence of
the 1st defendant that she only entered into the Plaintiff’s Mortgage due to the undue influence of the 5th defendant as believable and therefore giving rise to triable issues which might amount to a credible defence.  Accordingly, I refuse
the application of the 1st defendant that the plaintiff’s Originating Summons be continued as if begun by writ or alternatively that it be heard (wholly or
in part) on oral evidence and therefore I give judgment for the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s counsel provided a draft order to the
court for the hearing on 6 July 2017.  I make an order nisi in the terms of the said draft on terms that if any party seeks a variation to the draft they shall apply within 14 days of the date
of handing down of judgment by letter to my clerk setting out the variation they seek.  However, I would encourage the parties to

In my judgment, these matters are irrelevant as to whether the court should order inquiry as to damages resulting from the discharge

resulting from the wrongful granting of the Injunction Order. 35.  After the hearing, the 1st and 2nd Defendants through their solicitors write to the court indicating they would not proceed with the inquiry for the Default Payment
Claim.  Hence I only make an order for inquiry in respect of the Depreciation in Value Claim and award damages in favour of the 2nd Defendant in the sum of HK$3,508,600.  The parties have not addressed me on the issue of interest and so I reserve my decision on

 DLA for the 2nd Accused","43.  The constitutional right at stake in the instant case is the inviolability of a person’s home or other premises.  The issue here
is not simply privacy rights.  I have attempted to outline the importance of that right in earlier passages of this judgment.  It
is a right which is not absolute and an intrusion on such rights which is arbitrary or not lawful should be viewed with seriousness.
 The authorities cited above clearly support the proposition that in granting a search warrant which would render lawful an intrusion
into the rights guaranteed under Article 29 of the Basic Law must take into account that the grant of such a warrant would be such
an intrusion.  The warrantless search formerly permitted under section 52(1)(e) has now been narrowed so as to permit this if, and
only if, the obtaining of a warrant under section 52(1E) is not reasonably practicable.  That too underlines importance that the
legislature accords to the rights of the nature of those guaranteed under Article 29.  The respect due to this right is, in my view,
of the utmost importance.  Nevertheless, in the specific circumstancesof this case it seems to me that the reception into evidence
of the product of the searches of both premises is conducive to a fair trial and most assuredly would not place in jeopardy a fair
trial.  The evidence is both important and cogent and would, for all practical purposes bring to an end the trial of Counts 2 and
3 on the indictment.[23]  Speaking generally and applying the proposition specifically to this set of circumstances, the attempt to fight against the unlawful
trafficking of dangerous drugs is a matter of the highest importance.  In this case, the product of the searches reveals a very serious
case.  Although it is inappropriate at this stage to start looking at the quantum of any sentence that the accused might receive
on conviction for the 2nd and 3rd counts on the indictment and, in particular, the 3rd count, such a sentence would be very substantial and would reflect the serious view that the community of Hong Kong takes with respect
to the unlawful trafficking of substantial quantities of dangerous drugs — particularly of the kind of drugs involved here.  On
any view, this is a serious case.  In my opinion, had I been of the view that the search of the 2 premises had been unlawful and
not justified by section 52(1)(e) of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, I would not have hesitated to hold that the breach in the specific circumstances of this case is anything other than reconcilable
withthe respect due to the right or rights concerned. 44. The final issue arising from HKSAR ‍v ‍Muhammad Riaz Khan (above) that needs to be  considered in this context is whether a ‍ruling in favour of the  prosecution appears unlikely to encourage
any future breaches of the rights at issue.  In my ‍judgement, the unique circumstances  of this case, where one ‍arm of the
police (the Mong Kok SDS team) was doing  its job in an ‍apparently perfectly appropriate and professional way[24] and unbeknownst to the Mong Kok SDS team another arm of the police (the Narcotics Bureau) was doing an apparently perfectly appropriate
and professional job in terms of the detection of crime but, as I have held, fell down in relation to how it dealt with search warrants
and unintentionally left the Mong Kok SDS team in a position where the obtaining of a search warrant under section 52(1E) was not reasonably practicable, I think that this alone would demonstrate that such ruling of this Court in the present circumstances
would be unlikely to encourage any future breaches of this kind.  I hasten to add in this context that the officers of the Narcotics
Bureau in not applying for a fresh warrant or applying to renew the existing warrant were not acting in any form of bad faith.  They
simply got the law wrong.  Further, I would be extremely surprised if the law enforcement agencies have not reviewed their practices
in the light of the decision in Keen Lloyd & Ors v Commissioner of Customs and Excise & Department of Justice (above) and there are in place practices and procedures to minimise the risk of future breaches of the rights involved in this case
on the basis of a stale warrant. 45.  For these reasons, I order that the product of the searches of both the Hennessy Road and Canal Road West premises is admissible
against the 1st Accused.  While parties to these proceedings should be permitted to see these reasons for my decision without delay, I think it is
inappropriate and potentially not conducive to a fair trial for there to be any publicity which refers to the degree to which the
police (in this context, I refer to the police as a whole) considered the 1st Accused to be a target for their interest in connection with trafficking in dangerous drugs.  Thus, while I will provide the reasons
for my decision to the parties, I direct that the reasons should not otherwise be published until the conclusion of the trial or
further order.","LAM AROON

JANET ELIZABETH NICHOL v. LEE SIK PO KELVIN [2017] HKCFI 1708; HCA 2254/2013 (26 September 2017),"Ms Christine Yu, instructed by Tam, Pun & Yipp, for the defendant","109.  The parties attended before the Listing Clerk and fixed the substantive hearing of the Summons before Master Hui on 16 May 2017.
Ms Chan and Ms Yu were briefed to appear at such hearing. The hearing bundle was prepared, served and lodged. Skeleton submissions
were also lodged and served by both counsel. When counsel and their instructing solicitors appeared before the learned master on
16 May 2017, both sides were quite ready to proceed with substantive arguments. However, Master Hui took the view it must have been
implicit in the Kwok Order that the hearing of the Summons should be heard by a judge and not a master. I am unable to so read the Kwok Order.
But be that as it may, both Ms Yu and Ms Chan informed this court at the Hearing that they both urged upon Master Hui to hear them
as (a) the learned master had jurisdiction to hear the Summons, (b) they were quite ready to proceed, (c) court hearing time had
been allotted for substantive hearing of the Summons that day and (d) irrespective of any view taken of the Kwok Order both parties
had no objection for the Summons to be heard by a master. Master Hui did not accede to such submissions, and made no order in respect
of the Summons with costs reserved. I do not understand why the learned master did not deal with costs of the hearing before him
since the decision to make no order on the Summons did not turn on the ultimate merits of the Summons and was a matter privy to him
rather than the eventual tribunal for the substantive hearing of the Summons. 110.  Indeed, D tried to ameliorate the consequences of the Hui Order by having his solicitors write to P’s solicitors on 19 May 2017
proposing “in light of the observations made by Master during the hearing that implied in paragraph 4 of [the Kwok Order] is a
direction that the hearing be fixed before Judge and not Master” to file a consent summons for the Summons to be heard before a
master.  But no doubt as a matter of prudence arising from Master Hui’s observations that instilled concern over the implied effect of the Kwok Order (although I do not read such order that way), P’s solicitors replied on 23 May 2017 that it would be better
to re-fix the hearing before a judge as soon as possible. 111.  Thus, the consequence of the Hui Order was that costs incurred by both parties for the hearing on 16 May 2016 were wasted, and the
hearing of the Summons was deferred for 3½ months until the Hearing on 30 August 2017. By the time the Summons came before this
court, there was, of course, no help for it (as both Ms Yu and Ms Chan recognised and accepted) but to grant the cost order in paragraph
103(d) above. Given the pragmatic, efficiency-oriented and cost-saving CJR culture which should have prevailed by now, it is, however,
a sad waste of time, cost and effort to adjourn when the parties were ready to and indeed wished to proceed, and when the tribunal
had hearing time and jurisdiction, and if there was any concern (which I disagree) all that was needed was an order by consent for
the Summons to be heard by the master (which again would be a matter within the jurisdiction of the master).","LEE SIK PO KELVIN

Fees for the two counsel were quoted at the same time.  They were quoted on the basis that the senior counsel would have the assistance
of junior counsel.  I bear in mind the complexity of the case, especially in terms of the contrasting factual versions relied on
by the parties, as well as the value of the convertible bond and the importance of the case to the 1st Defendant.  The absolute figure claimed is, in my experience, not unreasonable even though it was exclusive of further drafting or
settling of documents, consultations and conferences.  I will stick to my original ruling. 61.  I have only revised my ruling in respect of items 32, 46, 70.1-70.7 and 76 of Section A.  The net result is to deduct a further

With regard to contempt of court, neither counsel developed submissions on the point.  Moreover, I consider such a serious allegation
is one in respect of which the parties should have the opportunity to provide evidence.  There was no such opportunity.  For these

 Applications for costs to be taxed and paid forthwith are quite commonplace and the result is a matter for a court’s discretion.
 With regard to the defendant’s particular applications, the manner in which they were conducted was not oppressive and they were
supported by considered submissions; they were not frivolous or vexatious.  I make the same observation in respect of the application

With regard to Mr Koo’s last point of limitation, I have doubt whether s. 4 of the Limitation Ordinance can apply to a claim for retransfer of land based on resulting trust.  In any case, the claim does not arise unless and until the
plaintiff has withdrawn from the illegal agreements.  I cannot see how the plaintiff can maintain his involvement in the illegality
and at the same time seek retransfer of the property in question.  Hence, the cause of action only arose upon withdrawal from the
agreements.  This ground of objection thus has no merit. 63.  Though Mr Koo has not raised this question, I would also advert to it.  This action was started in 2007.  But 2nd defendant’s listing questionnaire filed on 10 February 2017 still said that it was not appropriate to set the case down for trial.
 Furthermore, the development cannot proceed further because the District Lands Office will not issue any more building licence for
the lots as a result of the plaintiff’s complaint.  The situation is thus in a deadlock.  There is no pressing need for the actin
to be disposed of.  I have also observed that the new cause of action based on illegality may assume core importance in this action.
 Hence, delay is not a factor against the granting leave to re-amend the statement of claim. 64.  I will grant leave to the plaintiff to effect the proposed re-amendments with consequential directions and costs order.  However,
I would give the plaintiff one more opportunity to consider and advise me no later than 6 October 2017 on whether he would have further
revisions to make to the draft re-amendments to take into account of the development of the law in Patel v Mirza and if so, when the revisions will be ready.",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/1735.html,"Mr Wong Chao Wai Brian, instructed by Edward Lau, Wong & Lou, for the plaintiff",wong chao wai brian,jay cheung,Hui & Lam LLP,"Edward Lau, Wong & Lou",plaintiff,1.0

The complaint relating to the inherent improbability of the Defendant’s case is not pursued by Mr Kwok in the appeal, and rightly
so.  There is nothing inherent in the Defendant’s case, and there is no basis for the court to disturb the primary findings of
fact made by the Presiding Officer. 55.  Finally, Mr Kwok also raises a procedural challenge in respect of the evidence given by Madam Tsui of the Defendant.  He refers
to an incident that occurred during the trial on 9 July 2015.  According to Mr Kwok, the Presiding Officer should have disallowed
part of Ms Tsui evidence because a trainee solicitor hired by the Defendant was feeding the answers to her.  However, the Presiding
Officer had dealt with such complaint in the Decision.  She had already rejected Madam Tsui’s evidence given in the morning of
9 July 2015 and accorded very little weight to the rest of her evidence.[25]  Hence, such procedural challenge simply has no merit at all. 56.  For the above reasons, the Presiding Officer was entitled to make the finding that the Claimant was not working as an employee of

 Director of Legal Aid, for the defendant","27.  It seems to me that a defendant’s participation in the campaign is a reflection of his genuine remorse for the crime that he has
committed and desire to assist the authorities to prevent others from making the same mistake.  It is the display of remorse and
cooperativeness with the authorities that a sentencing court can recognise within its sentencing discretion.  To this end, it needs
to be established on evidence that the defendant has genuinely participated in the campaign, and that the participation has been
positive and substantial.  28.  As I have already indicated, the narcotic content of cocaine in the present case warrants a starting point of 24 years’ imprisonment.
There is an international element involved in this offence because the defendant was importing drugs into Hong Kong.  The sentencing
guidelines provide that an international element is an aggravating factor calling for the enhancement of the starting point where
for amounts above 1 kg should not be less than 2 years’ imprisonment.  Accordingly, the starting point is enhanced by 2 years to
26 years’ imprisonment.  As I have stated I will reduce her sentence by 9 months for her genuine, and positive and substantial
participation in Father Wotherspoon’s campaign which will result in a starting point of 25 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.

made it clear that it would be seeking indemnity costs. 5.  The court has already outlined the chronology. This is a case where I take the view that indemnity costs should be awarded to Glencore.
 When a company has been wound up, a summons to rescind that winding-up order must be supported by very strong grounds.  The requirements
are well-known and not in dispute.  But here, there is simply nothing filed in support of the summons.  There was merely a passing
reference in the correspondence to the fact that the court would be requested to read certain lengthy accountancy documents.  6.  I take the view that the attitude taken in pursuit of the summons verges on an abuse of process.  The summons should not have been
taken out in the first place.  At best, the contributories were optimistic at that time that good reason would come into existence.

Having regard to all the circumstances in this case, including the likely costs liability, I consider a starting point of $400,000
appropriate for the seriousness of this case.  I reduce it to $300,000. 40.  As Wong adopted a negative role in complying with the disclosure order by leaving it to Tang to perform, what I have said about
Tang applies equally to her.  This is because the duty of disclosure is a non‑delegable one.  Having regard to her passive role,
her personal circumstances and the fact that she has retired, I consider a lower starting point of $300,000 appropriate and reduce
the fine to $200,000.  41.  I also make the usual costs order that the defendants shall pay the Trustees’ costs on an indemnity basis.","ALAN CHUNG WAH TANG and

solicitors dated 20 September 2017.  Such action was strongly rebuked by Tian’s solicitors as improper.  I agree with Tian that
there was no or no adequate justification to take the unusual course of making uninvited submissions to the court after the conclusion
of a hearing (see To Pui Kui v Ng Kwok Piu, CACV 281/2012, 21 August 2014, §§56-58). 45.  In any case, I see no reason to change my mind on the determination of this application.  However, as a result of the additional

Regrettably, none of these orders has produced any real hint as to where the LaFerrari is.  I have to say, in fairness to the 3rd Defendant, that I understand that the orders have not been served on it. 3.  The evidence before the court is quite disturbing. It appears that there is a concerted effort by various parties to try to hide
from the court, and thereby frustrating the disclosure orders, as to the whereabouts of the LaFerrari.  With respect, the alleged
sale or re-sale of the LaFerrari is, on the available evidence, difficult to believe due to, inter alia, the vast undervalue at which
it was purportedly sold and re-sold.  There is clearly urgency in the matter, which was accepted by DHCJ Keith and DHCJ Francis.
The urgency remains.  In particular, the property has still not been located and the orders which were made by the court have been
frustrated.   4.  In these circumstances, there is justification for making a further disclosure order as requested by the Plaintiff.  Hence, I have

It is not necessary for me to explain in any detail the possible application and qualifications to the approach described by Ribeiro
PJ because it seems to me that there is a simpler justification for changing the costs order.  4.  As is apparent from my reasons, a very significant part of the argument before me and the time spent in court, namely, three days,
arose from various arguments advanced by the defendant which I thought were misconceived and in some instances clearly so.  Ms Cheng
whilst reminding me of the principles explained in cases like Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2) [2] has not invited me to apportion the costs.  But it does seem to me that as any costs order largely goes to financial matters and
the financial impact of litigation, the way in which the hearing developed and the matters attributable to the length of this hearing
and the preparation required for it are relevant in determining whether or not costs should be ordered on an indemnity basis or the
more conventional party-and-party basis.  On balance it seems to me that in the circumstances whatever concerns I may harbour about
the approach of the plaintiff to this matter, the appropriate order, I am satisfied, is that the defendant’s costs should be paid
by the plaintiff with a certificate for two counsel and assessed on a party-and-party basis. 5.  So far as the costs of this summons are concerned, Ms Cheng has unsurprisingly asked for an order that the defendant pay the costs
with a certificate for one counsel.  It does, however, seem to me that as the costs order nisi was my initiative and therefore an application to vary it had to be made in any event, and also having regard to the broad approach
that I have suggested earlier in this decision is appropriate when determining costs in this particular case, I will make no order

dismissed without order of the court. Should Chen fail to pay the prescribed security within the prescribed time, it would be for
Ng/Daughter to take appropriate action as they see fit in relation to the disposal of the present proceedings. But it would be inappropriate
for this court to order dismissal of the present proceedings without further order. 123.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event.

Having reached the above conclusions, it is strictly not necessary for me to consider that the question of whether the Special Meeting
is excepted from the definition of “meeting” in section 2(1) as being a “gathering or assembly of persons convened or organized exclusively … as a conference or seminar bona fide intended
for the discussion of topics of a … professional, business … character.”  Had it been necessary to do so, I would have considered
it reasonably arguable that this exception does not, or may not, apply to the Special Meeting having regard to the purpose of the
meeting, the identity of the persons being invited to attend the meeting, the matters discussed at the meeting, the conduct of the
participants at the meeting, as well as the resolution passed at the meeting. 40.  For the foregoing reasons, the applications for leave to amend or re-amend the Form 86, as well as the application for leave to
apply for judicial review, are dismissed. Where an application for leave to apply for judicial review is dismissed on the ground
that the applicant has no standing to make the application, it may properly be regarded as an abuse of the court’s process.  Taking
into account also the lack of merits in the proposed challenge and the substantial assistance that the court has received from the
putative respondents (including the evidence filed on their behalf), I consider that the putative respondents ought to be entitled

These having been said, the court can only exercise its discretion regarding interim distribution based on proper information and
materials normally put before it by those who have been appointed to administer the estate and who ought to be in a good position
to provide such information and materials.  In the present case, I consider the plaintiffs have wholly failed to make any real attempt
to justify the estimated costs or potential liabilities of the estate of the Deceased.  The plaintiffs’ estimated total figure
of around HK$125 million, as well as the individual estimated sums, are, in my view, unreliable.  Distribution of the estate of the
Deceased is long overdue, being in mind that the Deceased passed away more than 13 years ago and probate was granted to the Executrices
more than 11 years ago.  Doing the best that I can on the information and materials before me and taking a broad view of the situation,
I consider that a reserve of HK$50 million should be ample to provide for the potential costs and liabilities of the estate in respect
of the items referred by Mr Wong.  Taking into account also Mr Leung’s submission that the cash in the RMB account may not be readily
realizable, I consider that an interim distribution of HK$88 million ought to be made to the beneficiaries of the estate of the Deceased. 13.  For the foregoing reasons, I direct the Executrices to make a further interim distribution of HK$88 million to the beneficiaries

The Solicitors were acting in discharge of their duties to assist the Mother in reducing the impact of DLA’s first charge and
to protect the legal aid fund.  Their honest but erroneous interpretation as to children’s maintenance being excepted from DLA’s
first charge is not a reason to deprive them of costs.  Unlike Manley, the legal aid fund is not deprived in any way as the proposed Settlement is not yet finalized.  I am not satisfied that the solicitors’
conduct fell within the principles of Manley. 55.  This appeal is therefore dismissed, but I decline DLA’s request to deprive the Mother’s solicitors of costs. 56.

","44.  If the Accused had continued to have the difficulties which he manifested for some minutes at the customs area at Sha Tau Kok then
there might have been a real issue as to the fitness of the Accused which might have presented issues in connection with the voluntariness
of the admissions against interest made by the Accused in the sense that it may have been oppressive to continue to ask questions
of him which produced admissible material.  It may have been an issue for the exercise of the discretion of the court to exclude
otherwise admissible material on the usual criteria.  However, there was nothing in the CCTV or in the video recorded interview or
in the testimony of the police officers (which I accept) which caused me concern in relation to the various issues of admissibility
that might have otherwise arisen.  That the Accused may not have been in perfect condition is not to the point.  The issues that
arose in relation to the health of the Accused were not such at the time that he made the various admissions attributed to him to
have rendered those admissions involuntary.  Further, on no account could those admissions, specifically at the times they were made,
be excluded on the basis of an exercise of the court’s discretion. 45.  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the testimony of the officers in rejecting the allegations of threats and inducements.
 I am satisfied the same standard that the health issues which manifested themselves at a particular point in time were such that
at the time that the admissions attributed to the Accused were made that they caused any basis for doubting the voluntariness of
those admissions.  There was nothing in the condition of the Accused which could possibly have justified the exclusion of the admissions
attributed to the Accused on the basis of an exercise of the discretion of the court. 46.

if the court were to grant the declaration sought against it in the action which would involve the balance of the purchase price
having to be returned. 24.  Assuming that the supplemental agreement is held to be void, it does not follow that the applicant would necessarily suffer any
prejudice because for one thing the company must still perform the Contract by paying the balance of the purchase price to the applicant.
 In any event, it is no more than a possible consequence of a successful claim against D1 – D3.  It is hardly conceivable that
the relief the court would consider appropriate would not ensure that the effect on the applicant would be neutral. 25.  For those reasons, I have no hesitation in dismissing the summons.

Mr Thomas Iu, for D4, in his oral and written submissions, questioned the nature of the evidence against D4.  He pointed out that
there was no evidence of association between D4 and the defendants except for the outing on 27 and 28 May 2015 and his attendance
at electronic courses together with D3 and D5.  He further pointed out that D4 had no contact or involvement with the relevant defendants
in relation to the events on 14 June 2015.  He challenged the evidence of PW3 and PW4 and noted that Superintendent Roberts (PW34),
was unsure in his expert opinion about the observations of the police officers on 28 May 2015.  The various points and issues that
he has raised are matters for the jury to consider and determine.  42.  Mr Keith Fung, for D5, in oral submissions submitted that apart from the admissions made by D5 in the two VRIs and the video reconstruction,
there was no evidence of association between D5 and the others and nothing incriminating was found at his home when searched by the
police.  He sought to rely on the inconsistencies of D5’s answers in his caution statements but it would appear that there are
admissions contained in them that the prosecution can rely on in relation to Count 1.  43.  The matters raised by counsel for the defendants in their no case submissions do not justify taking the case away from the jury.
 There is in my view a case to answer against each of the defendants on the counts that they respectively face.  The matters that
they have raised are matters appropriately in the province of the jury and for them to consider together with all the other evidence
presented to them. ",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2017/2401.html,"Mr Randy Shek, instructed by Bond Ng Solicitors, assigned by Director of Legal Aid, for the 1st defendant",randy shek,douglas kwok,JCC Cheung & Co.,Bond Ng Solicitors,defendant,0.0

Based on all these conclusions, the counterclaim of the Trustees must be dismissed. 67.  Now I turn to the issue of costs. There is no reason why costs should not follow the event. Madam Leung and the Trustees should
pay the costs of Mr Chu of these proceedings including the Trustees’ counterclaim and all previously reserved costs. On the other
hand, I find the defence to be completely devoid of merits, particularly given the existence of the Consent Order. The affirmation
evidence of Madam Leung taken at its highest could not be sufficient to substantiate a plea of undue influence. In my view, Mr Chu
is entitled to indemnity costs against Madam Leung and the Trustees, to be taxed if not agreed. I make an order nisi in these terms. 68.  It crossed my mind that an order made under O.62 r.6(2), Rules of the High Court, against the Trustees might be appropriate but
I eventually decided against it, though I have to say it was not a straightforward question. I do expect that the Trustees, being
legal practitioners themselves, should exercise their expertise in the administration of the affairs of Madam Leung and should not
have taken Madam Leung’s words at face value. They really should have thought twice before taking any step in these proceedings.

not filed until 30 October 2017.  6.  Although the language of rule 32(1) of the Winding Up Rules does not directly apply to the situation where before evidence in opposition
is filed an amended petition and further verifying affidavit is filed, it seems to me that although not entirely clear, for the purposes
of rule 32(1), the relevant time is the filing of the most recent verifying affidavit. That means that although it is entirely fortuitous
the Company has filed evidence in opposition within the time period specified in the Winding Up Rules and, therefore, does not require

which there is no reason to think are insolvent, should only be made in straightforward cases where it is clear to the petitioner’s
lawyers that there is little ground for the debtor company to dispute liability.  If there is doubt about this, then the prudent
course is to proceed to obtain judgment to recover the sums believed to be payable.  12.  So far as I can see from the papers which I have before me, this is a case, which in my view, it should have been appreciated was

evidence and her conduct is very suspicious.   31.  To maintain the proper administration of justice in Hong Kong, a clear message must be sent to the public that court orders must
be strictly complied with. Absent any mitigating factors, this court should mark the disapproval at Madam Lau’s knowing and serious
breach of the Injunction by an immediate custodial sentence. 32.  Having looked at the matter in the round, I commit Madam Lau to prison for 28 days.

It also seems to me arguable that an independent non‑executive director of Mr Best’s experience should have raised concerns
about proceeding with the transaction without obtaining both thorough written legal advice on 8 December 2010 and some more information
about the attitude of other shareholders in Liu’s Holdings about the proposed transaction.  It seems to me also arguable that the
Deacons’ letter of 17 January 2011 should have brought home to him that the restrictions on transfer of the Sale Shares were not
mere technicalities, but suggested a more serious problem might exist which went to the commercial viability of the transaction.
 It seems to me that it is in this regard, rather more than by approving the announcement in the Circular, that it is arguable that
Mr Best was in breach of duty.  Or to put it in language more relevant, given the relevant criteria: it does not seem to me that
it is plain and obvious that Mr Best had not, at least in some regards, failed in his duties as a director of the Company. 50.  Can it be said at this stage that it is plain and obvious that even if the court found Mr Best had breached his duties in the manner
I have referred to, the breaches are plainly and obviously not capable of justifying the serious sanction of disqualification?  In
my view, it cannot.  I, of course, express no view on the strength of the case against Mr Best, but I am not satisfied at this stage
that it is plain and obvious that after a trial of the Petition, it will not be possible, when Mr Best’s conduct comes to be considered

documents which will assist the court to determine the merits of Tang’s case. 14.  This application must be properly justified. The court looks at the substance of the assertions that the deponents are untruthful.
 The exercise is not one of combing through the evidence with a microscope and say, eg, that X had failed to mention in his evidence
the presence of Y[1]. There can be a number of explanations for the omission.  Unless there is adequate reason to believe that the omission was something

THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF DAYS IMPEX LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. PITTY KWOK KWAI WAH [2017] HKCFI 2206; HCCW 298/2011 (15 November 2017),The respondent appeared in person,"11.  Till this date, I have not seen Ms Kwok make attempts to obtain the relevant transcripts, whether from her former solicitors in
the criminal trial or the court.  She estimated that out of the 60 days of criminal trial, about 10 to 15 days’ transcripts would
be required.  However, she has done nothing to identify those 10 to 15 days.  She is well advised to proceed to obtain a CD of the
proceedings in the criminal trial and pick the relevant days of transcript evidence to be transcribed by the court as soon as possible. 12.  As for the 600 boxes of liquidators’ documents, it is not for Ms Kwok to fish for evidence without even stating her affirmation
in opposition.  The necessary documents in support of the liquidators’ case have already been given to her as exhibits to the liquidators’
affirmations.  I will not exclude the possibility that with a proper affirmation in opposition and with sufficient identification
of relevant documents, the court will permit Ms Kwok to file a further affirmation or a further summons for production of documents
should circumstances require.  But as of the present, I require Ms Kwok to file an affirmation in opposition to the liquidators’
summons as soon as possible. 13.  Appreciating the difficulties to her as a litigant in person and the volume of documents now relied on by the liquidators, I will

THE JOINT AND SEVERAL LIQUIDATORS OF DAYS IMPEX LTD (IN LIQUIDATION) v. PITTY KWOK KWAI WAH [2017] HKCFI 2207; HCCW 299/2011 (15 November 2017),The respondent appeared in person,"11.  Till this date, I have not seen Ms Kwok make attempts to obtain the relevant transcripts, whether from her former solicitors in
the criminal trial or the court.  She estimated that out of the 60 days of criminal trial, about 10 to 15 days’ transcripts would
be required.  However, she has done nothing to identify those 10 to 15 days.  She is well advised to proceed to obtain a CD of the
proceedings in the criminal trial and pick the relevant days of transcript evidence to be transcribed by the court as soon as possible. 12.  As for the 600 boxes of liquidators’ documents, it is not for Ms Kwok to fish for evidence without even stating her affirmation
in opposition.  The necessary documents in support of the liquidators’ case have already been given to her as exhibits to the liquidators’
affirmations.  I will not exclude the possibility that with a proper affirmation in opposition and with sufficient identification
of relevant documents, the court will permit Ms Kwok to file a further affirmation or a further summons for production of documents
should circumstances require.  But as of the present, I require Ms Kwok to file an affirmation in opposition to the liquidators’
summons as soon as possible. 13.  Appreciating the difficulties to her as a litigant in person and the volume of documents now relied on by the liquidators, I will
give her 4 months’ extension but on an unless order basis.  In other words, unless, by 4 pm on 15 March 2018, Ms Kwok files and

Therefore, although neither of them was seen packaging or dealing with the drugs at the time of the police entry, the only conclusion
on the facts of this case must be that it was they who had so packaged the drugs in the premises and they were, at the time of the
arrest, having joint control of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 33.  In other words, I reject D1’s claim that he had only been given HK$2,000 for storing the drugs. I also reject D2’s claim that
he had not been promised, nor had received, any reward for the part he took in the offence.  Having considered all the relevant circumstances,
including that both defendants were foreigners in HK who were subject to working restrictions, the fact that the bulk of the money
found was in HK currency, and that both were having financial difficulties at the time, I find that the cash sought by the prosecution
to be forfeited was the reward each of them received or money possessed by each of them as a result or product of the drug offence. 34.  I order that exhibits P28 to P38, P45, and P54 to P56, that is, the cash found inside the paper box on the TV cabinet in the living

before the court could set out established principles in this area. I identified in my decision some of those factors which would
need to be debated at an appropriate time in a future case. 6.  Once I permitted the plaintiff to rely on Professor Nutting, it followed that I ought to permit him to instruct an overseas radiologist

enjoy ease of communication with the defendant’s expert radiologist in Hong Kong.  I do not see any merit in the grounds of appeal

was that even in relation to this summons I should make a cost order nisi, and that if I were to find for the defendant the question of the costs of the adjourned summons should be reserved for a separate

myself that the defendant has established good grounds that the action be stayed and referred to arbitration, it follows in my judgement
that the plaintiff should pay the defendant’s costs with a certificate for two counsel. I also consider that those costs should
be payable immediately. 32.  As to the costs of the adjourned summons, this was not of course formally heard but, given my decision and in light of the submissions

finding that it cannot place weight on the company records as showing the truth of the contents was a finding based on evidence existing

At some stage during these seven years, their personality has mutated.  They have forgotten their position as liquidators and officers
of the court performing a public function and have switched to serve their new master in persecuting the Father and in actively pursuing
their new master’s and their personal interest.  They did not respect their position as officers of the court and did not respect
the court’s findings.  They tried to avoid or nullify the court’s findings in order to advance Ken’s interest.  They did not
act in the interest of those entitled to the asset of the Company.  They abused the power the court bestowed on them.  They tried
to create work and profits for themselves.  In particular, their conduct in relation to the “recent hidden” tax liability issue
was ugly.  The way they conducted this liquidation was shameful.  They have completely forfeited the confidence of the court.  I
am mindful that these are harsh comments may have a serious impact on their professional practice.  But the way they conducted the
liquidation asked for these harsh comments.  The only course now open to this court is to remove them from their appointmentwith
an advice to the Official Receiver to review their suitability as liquidators. 132.   For the above reasons, I grant the Petitioner’s application to stay the Winding-up Order permanently and to remove the Liquidators.
 To reflect the court’s feeling of indignation and condemnation of their conduct, the Liquidators should pay the Petitioner’s
costs of the application on indemnity basis.  Though Ken’s position is somewhat different from that of the Liquidators, his conduct,
which was what gave rise to the Liquidators’ conduct, and the way he contested the application also justify indemnity costs against
him.  Accordingly, I make a costs order that the 1st Respondent and the Liquidators shall pay the Petitioner’s costs of the application on indemnity basis with certificate for four
counsel.  133.   I apologise to the parties for the time taken in my deliberation.  I thank the legal teams of the parties for their contribution.

As I have already explained, it is well established that a petition seeking a winding-up order against a solvent company by a shareholder
should state why a winding-up order rather than a share buy‑out order may be necessary.  To present a petition which does not do
so is prima facie an abuse of process.  Of course there will be occasions in which the failure to include a precise reason for seeking a winding-up
order will be an oversight or result from infelicities in the drafting of the petition.  It does not, however, seems to me that this
is such a case.  19.  The problems with the 1st petition should have focused minds on the criteria which apply to petitions of this sort.  The fact that the present petition makes
no reference to, for example, a concern about the 1st respondent’s ability to buy the shares of the petitioner suggests that there was no motivation in presenting the 2nd petition other than putting pressure on the 1st respondent to improve his offer.  The subsequent conduct of the proceedings which I have referred to earlier by the petitioner also
points to the conclusion that this, at each stage of the proceedings, is what has motivated the petitioner.  Even the fact that it
was not until immediately before the present hearing, and I understand from Mr Ho that he was only instructed yesterday, that the
petitioner agreed to the present petition being dismissed suggests that the petitioner’s approach is driven purely by commercial
considerations rather than the sort of considerations relevant to the inclusion of a prayer for a winding-up order.  20.  It does, therefore, seem to me that this is an appropriate case to make not only a costs order against the petitioner with a certificate
for two counsel, but also to order that the petitioner pays the costs of the petition on an indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 28 November 2017(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2017/2343.html,"Mr Martin Ho, instructed by Tanner De Witt, for the petitioner",martin ho,sharon yuen,K B Chau & Co,Tanner De Witt,defendant,0.0

the interim stay sought by the applicant) and that they were to make submissions on grounds other than those that could be made by
the TPB (see Yiu Lian’s original substantive skeleton submissions opposing).  These amount to additional justifications to also
order costs against the applicant in favour of them. 21.  Finally, the applicant has submitted that she should not bear the putative parties’ costs incurred in preparing the opposing affirmations
as they were initially filed without leave of the court.  I am unable to accept this submission. First, before the applicant withdrew
her application, the parties had in correspondence contested on whether leave should be granted for the filing of those affirmations.
 She therefore was aware of the potentiality that leave might be granted eventually.  Second and in any event, leave was indeed subsequently
granted to the filing of those affirmations before she decided to withdraw the leave application.  In the premises, there are no reasons why the costs of affirmation should not be
treated as part and parcel of the putative parties’ costs of the leave application. 22.  For the above reasons, I order that costs of the leave application (including the costs of the opposing affirmations) be to the

and that must have been obvious to the 1st and/or 2nd defendants.  In the absence of any explanation, one could only conclude that the 1st and 2nd defendants were driven purely by a profit-making motive to sell so many policies to Angela within a period of some 5 years regardless
of her proper interest.  This is not a matter which the court can take any further, but may properly be investigated by the Insurance
Authority. 65.  I refuse Angela’s application to re‑amend the Statement of Claim in so far as the 1st and 2nd defendants are concerned, and dismiss her action against them. I also make an order nisi that Angela shall pay the 1st and 2nd defendants’ costs of this action, including the costs of (i) the 1st and 2nd defendants’ summons dated 8 April 2015, and (ii) her summons dated 16 December 2015, as well as all costs previously reserved,

on where the Fund has gone because the Receipt was dated after the prescribed period for payment to Shanghai Yu Hang.  I do not need
to decide on this point.  On the evidence of the defendant, the Fund was in the defendant’s control for a short period of time.
It is in respect of this short period of time that the plaintiff requires an account from the defendant. 29.  I am satisfied that the information sought (which is limited to movement from the time when the Fund was deposited into the defendant’s
account to the time when the same was transferred to the defendant’s personal friend) is not oppressive, and should be within the

Her position has been compromised by the fact that she has beenrepresented by the solicitors for the 1st defendant. There was obviously a conflict of interest and she should have been separately represented.  She has been used, as a consequence,
to support the case of the 1st defendant by giving evidence for him.  She was used by him to facilitate his actions to assert belatedly his claim to possession
and to take steps to interfere with that part of Lot 965 to which the plaintiff has successfully established adverse possession. 96.  Whilst she was unwise, to say the least, to involve herself in any part of the 1st defendant’s activities in 2013/2014, there is no basis for any judgment against her.  Therefore she is entitled to have the claim
against her dismissed and I do so.  However there will be no costs order in her favour as she was used as part of his co-defendant’s

many reasons why the plaintiff in view of its position as a charity in the United States, Hong Kong and elsewhere decided to hold
its hand for a while to see how matters might resolve themselves but it is pointless to seek to identify them.  Its prime objective
was, and is, humanitarian medical treatment based heavily on volunteer professional expertise and generous benefactors — the heavy

Section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance sets out the requirements and power for a hospital order in respect of mentally disordered offenders.  The purpose of this power
is to appropriately deal with and treat a mentally disordered offender by addressing the issue and also ensuring the future protection
of the public.  It is therefore important that an hospital order specifies whether the offender should be committed to a psychiatric
centre or a mental hospital and whether that should be for a determinate or indeterminate period.  It is for this reason that such
an order must be supported by medical evidence from two medical practitioners, one of which under section 46 is required to be a medical officer. 12.  From the information at hand, I am of the view, that the defendant has a serious mental disorder and poses as a grave threat to
members of the public.  He has engaged in acts of violence in the past that has led the relevant medical authorities to classify
him as a target person, that is, a potentially violent case.  Unfortunately, the defendant’s proneness to violence has resulted
in the death of his mother.  His long history of aggressive and violent behaviour warrants that the hospital order be for an indeterminate
period.  This is supported by the psychiatric evidence. 13.  In accordance with section 45, having been satisfied that the requirements have been met or fulfilled, I order that the defendant be committed to a Correctional
Services Department Psychiatric Centre for an indeterminate period, pursuant to section 45 of the Mental Health Ordinance.  The recommendation of the two government psychiatrists is that the defendant be committed to the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre.

It is not necessary for me to decide whether paragraph 2 of the Supplementary Originating Summons relating to the liability issue
should be heard today, because one of the matters to be considered in respect of that issue is whether the plaintiff has waived certain
contractual requirement to be met for the defendant to be paid their fees, and Mr Chain accepts that the question of waiver entails
a consideration of the plaintiff’s state of knowledge which requires evidence to be adduced but no evidence has yet been filed
by the parties for the purpose of the Supplementary Originating Summons. 7.  In so far as paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Originating Summons relating to the interpretation issue is concerned, I am not minded
to split the Supplementary Originating Summons into two parts and dispose of paragraph 1 thereof only at this stage.  The defendant
could have issued the Supplementary Originating Summons shortly after the plaintiff issued its Originating Summons, but did not do
so until 14 December 2017.  No good explanation for the delay in issuing the Supplementary Originating Summons has been given.  There

as to how much time was spent by the solicitors and how much time by the trainee solicitor.  11.  In my assessment, the counsel fee is reasonable and the same can be said of the manual work and the disbursement.  However, the
fees claimed (for communications and professional work) by the fee-earners of D6’s solicitors are on the high side, bearing in
mind that counsel was briefed.  By a very broad brush approach, a global amount of $65,000 for D6’s costs would in my view be reasonable

dated 7 November 2016 executed by the plaintiff, the defendants, Sarah Chin, Vivian Chin, and Chin Ngai Lan. 6.   The parties to the Deed of Settlement also agree that letters of administration of the estate of the Deceased should be granted
to the plaintiff solely. 7.   On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that letters of administration of the estate of the Deceased ought to be granted to the
plaintiff, and I so order.  I do not propose to grant the declaration sought by the plaintiff because I do not consider that it serves
any practical purpose.  I should also record that, as confirmed by Mr Alan Kwong at the hearing today, the plaintiff no longer insists

As I have already mentioned, the two defence psychiatrists have submitted further reports in which they submit that the defendant
is unfit to be tried.  The government psychiatrist has now submitted his further report in which he submits the defendant is fit
to be tried.  The three psychiatrists in their previous reports provided medical opinions addressing the issue of diminished responsibility.
 They were divided on this issue on similar lines as they are now, and if it is determined that the defendant is fit to be tried,
the trial jury will be required to consider the differences in the medical opinions when addressing the ingredients of diminished
responsibility.  On what I have been provided, the section 75 application will require the jury to consider the different medical opinions between the defence doctors and the prosecution doctor
which will arise again if the case proceeds to trial when dealing with the issue of diminished responsibility.  14.  It has now been urged upon me by Mr Arthur, to which Mr Richmond is in agreement, that the question of fitness to be tried be dealt
with by the empanelled jury and that if they decide that the defendant is fit to be tried, then the trial should proceed before a
new jury.  If the empanelled jury decide that he is unfit to be tried, then they can deal with the determination whether he did the
acts as charged which appear not to be in dispute. 15.  On the basis of the position now taken by the parties and for the reasons mentioned above, the issue to be determined pursuant to
section 75 will be dealt with by the empanelled jury.  They will accordingly be required to take an oath or affirmation to determine whether
the defendant is fit to be tried and the charge to them will be that upon hearing the evidence, including the evidence that they
have heard so far, whether the defendant is under a disability so that he is not fit to be tried or not under a disability so that
he is fit to be tried.  Section 75(4)(b) gives the court the discretion to have the issue determined by the empanelled jury.  But in my view, the consequences of doing so
will mean in the circumstances of this case, if the jury decides the defendant is fit to be tried, then the trial on the general
issue will be before a new jury empanelled for that purpose. ",Date of Ruling: 4 January 2018(Kevin Zervos),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/602.html,"Mr Martyn Richmond and Mr Kelvin Man, counsel on fiat, for HKSAR",kelvin man,david cheng,"Ip, Kwan & Co.",,defendant,0.0

to be listed to be heard so early.  The idea of proceeding with the quantum exercise before the Court of Appeal heard the appeal
was sensible because if an appeal was also going to be lodged against my assessment on quantum, the Court of Appeal could deal with
it at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal.  However, given the further steps that needed to be taken, as set out
in §15(a) above, and given the state of the court’s diary, it was not possible, between 6 December 2017 and 8 May 2018, to complete
the quantum exercise in sufficient time to enable an appeal to be lodged against my assessment of quantum and to be dealt with by
the Court of Appeal at the same time as the hearing of the original appeal. 19.  For these reasons, I exercised my discretion to make the directions set out in §15 above.  Given the current state of affairs,
the road map provided by these directions is a pragmatic solution which enables the 3rd and 4th plaintiffs to refix the assessment of quantum expeditiously in the event that the 2nd and 4th defendants’ appeal is dismissed. 20.

It seems to me that disclosure of the documents, the use of which will be protected by the normal implied undertaking limiting their

greater benefit is likely to be achieved in terms of protecting those interests by introducing into this application an additional

it involves, and giving them the opportunity to address the court. 17.  As I understand it, subject to the qualification to which I have already referred, none of the parties object to the language of

how the Bank applied the sale proceeds of the Heng Fa Chuen Property in partial repayment of the indebtedness of Pada Far East, Colour

repaid. 9.  In these circumstances, this court is not satisfied on the evidence that the Debt has been repaid, as alleged by the Debtor.  There
being no other grounds put forward by the Debtor in opposition to the Petition, a bankruptcy order should be made. 10.

the Defendant","37.  The further and better particulars sought by the Plaintiff are as follows:- 38.  I consider that the Plaintiff is entitled to the particulars sought.  I am unable to accept Mr Fung’s submissions that those particulars
relate to “matters of evidence”, or are “wholly unnecessary for the fair disposal of this action or for saving costs”.  It
seems to me that the requests ask for particulars of fact which go directly to the Defendant’s allegation that “GE,Mr.Lo,variousoftheChildren,andthePlaintiff”
were “important” customers of the HSBC Group, and would explain why the Original Trustee and the Defendant would be prepared
to accept a fixed percentage fee for acting as trustee of the Trust which, according to the Plaintiff, is “relatively insubstantial
compared with the value of the Trust Fund”. 39.  For the foregoing reasons, I order the Defendant to give the particular sought by the Plaintiff referred to in paragraph 37 above
within 14 days of the date of the order herein.  On the issue of costs, most of the time at the hearing on 21 December 2017 was spent
on the first set of requests, which the Defendant has successfully resisted.  Overall, I consider that a fair order to make would
be that the Defendant shall have 80% of the costs of the application, to be taxed if not agreed, and I so order.  In view of the
fact that the application relates only to a matter of particulars which seems to me to be relatively straight forward, I am not inclined
to grant certificate for two counsel.  This having been said, I should acknowledge that I have substantially benefitted from the
careful and cogent submissions of counsel from both sides, to whom I am greatly indebted.",(Anderson Chow)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/33.html,"Mr Benjamin Yu, SC and Ms Sara Tong, instructed by Vivien Chan & Co,

Director of Legal Aid, for the defendant","9.  Count 1 concerns a quantity of Ice of 12g. Count 2 is simple possession of a small quantity of Ice which the prosecution has accepted
was for the defendant’s own consumption.  The starting point tariff as provided by HKSAR v Tam Yi Chun [2014] HKCA 279; [2014] 3 HKLRD 691 for the quantity of Ice in Count 1 is 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment.  The range of sentence for simple possession in the circumstances
of this case is 6 to 9 months’ imprisonment.  See HKSAR v Mok Cho Tik [2001] HKCA 61; [2001] 1 HKC 261.  The defendant has had a serious drug addiction and on his own admission, he had been consuming Ice since 2008.  10.  As the defendant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, he is entitled to a one-third discount to his sentences.  See HKSAR v Ngo Van Nam [2015] HKCFI 1752; [2016] 1 HKLRD 1.  Accordingly, the starting points will be reduced on Count 1 from 7 years and 1 month’s imprisonment to 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment, and on Count 2 from 9 months’ imprisonment to 6 months’ imprisonment.  11.  I bear in mind that if the quantity of drugs in the possession count had been added to the quantity of drugs in the trafficking
count, the starting point would have made very little difference to the resultant sentence.  To illustrate this point, on an arithmetic
calculation, the quantity of 12 g would result in a starting point of 85.6 months’ imprisonment, and 12.14 g would result in a
starting point of 85.72 months’ imprisonment.  For this reason, as well as bearing in mind the totality principle, I will order
that the sentences on the two counts be served concurrently.  Accordingly, the defendant will serve a sentence of 4 years and 8 months’
imprisonment.",(Kevin Zervos)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/61.html,"Mr Gary Leung, SPP (Ag) of Department of Justice, for HKSAR",gary leung,chan pak kong,C.K. Charles Ho & Co,,defendant,0.0

CHEN MEI HUAN v. SILVER FAITH HOLDINGS LTD AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 41; HCCW 111/2014 (15 January 2018),"Mr Alexander Tang, instructed by Ribeiro Hui, for the 2nd and 3rd respondents","30.  Sixthly, Ng/Daughter claimed brief fees (HK$150,000 for Mr Chua SC and HK$45,000 for Mr A Tang), conference fees (HK$8,460 for Mr
Chua SC and HK$6,250 for Mr A Tang) and fees for settling summons and affirmation/affidavit (HK$14,000 for Mr Chua SC and HK$34,300
for Mr A Tang). I am not persuaded a conference with counsel would be necessary at all. All that was required prior to the Hearing
as being necessary or proper was for junior counsel to settle Ng’s affirmations, and with proper instructions it would not have
required any conference whether with solicitors alone or with clients as well. It was the nuanced presentation of factual information
in solicitors’ drafts that required counsel’s skilled input, and it was not the function of counsel to gather primary instructions
during conference when costs were claimed for 2 fee-earners for attendance on client and preparation of documents. In particular,
I do not see any need for counsel to settle the summons and GR’s affirmation which was brief and well within the scope of work
and ability of DC/GR. In any event, I do not see any need, on party and party basis, to involve leading counsel for settling affirmation/affidavit. 31.  Taking into account all of the above matters, and upon considering the items of costs claimed to see whether or not they were “necessary
and its costs reasonable” on the sensible standard of necessity as explained by the Court of Appeal, Ng’s/Daughter’s total
costs on their Statement of Costs are assessed at HK$270,000.  Although I have explained in paragraph 7 above why written submissions
on summary assessment of costs should not be considered, having cast a quick eye over the contents of such submissions, I find that
even if I were to take them into account, they would not have swayed me from the above analysis and outcome. 32.  I therefore order that Chen shall pay Ng/Daughter costs in the sum of HK$270,000.",Date of Handing Down Decision (paper disposal): 15 January 2018(Marlene Ng),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/41.html,"Mr Danny Tang, instructed by Robertsons, for the petitioner",danny tang,alexander tang,Ribeiro Hui,Robertsons,unknown,

In respect of the Inaccuracy Defence, the defendants refer to the repayments made before the Loan Agreement made on 13 October 2016
and contend that the plaintiff has made mistakes in the calculation of the outstanding amounts under the previous loan agreements.
 To succeed in this defence, the defendants have to adduce sufficient evidence to show that there is a triable issue over whether
the previous loans were part and parcel of the Loan Agreement to defeat the MLO.  However, there is none. 13.  It remains for me to say that Mr Chau confirmed to me, sensibly, that he did not run any defence of misrepresentation.  There being
no evidence suggesting any concealment of the correct figures from the defendants at the time of the Loan Agreement, there is no
reason why the 1st defendant would not have known how much he had borrowed and repaid.  Any attempt to run the defence of misrepresentation would be
bound to fail. 14.  In conclusion, the defendants having raised no triable defence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought

LAM WAI LING MAYME v. HUTCHISON TELECOMMUNICATIONS (HONG KONG) LTD [2018] HKCFI 92; [2018] 1 HKC 394; HCPI 461/2015 (17 January 2018),"Mr Patrick D. Lim, instructed by Fairbairn Catley Low & Kong, for the defendant","24.  Order 22, r.10(2) provides that if there is subsisting an application to withdraw a sanctioned payment, the sanctioned payment may
not be accepted unless the Court grants leave to accept it.  Order 22, r.10(3) provides that if the Court dismisses an application
to withdraw, it may by order specify the period within which the sanctioned payment may be accepted.  The latter rule caters for
the situation where the plaintiff has not filed a notice of acceptance after an application has been made to withdraw the sanctioned
payment. The latter rule does not cover the present situation where the application to withdraw the sanctioned payment is followed
by a notice of acceptance, filed within the prescribed time, of the sanctioned payment.  After I had allowed the appeal and made
the orders set out in §4 above, I requested the parties to file further written submissions on the orders that I should make in
this case to enable the plaintiff to accept the sanctioned payment and the orders that I should make in relation to the interest
that has accrued on the sanctioned payment. 25.  I have considered the written submissions filed by the plaintiff. Although it was based on the UK rules, I have found the decision
of the UK Court of Appeal in John Joseph Flynn v. Tracey Scougall [2004]EWCA Civ 873,that was referred to by the plaintiff, to be of some assistance. In that case, the defendant had made a payment into court and subsequently received an expert’s report that was favourable to the
defence case. They then applied to diminish the amount they had paid into court. After receiving notice of the defendant’s application,
the plaintiff gave notice on 25 March 2003, within the prescribed time, accepting the payment in.  The Court of Appeal upheld the
judge’s decision to dismiss the defendant’s application to diminish the amount of the payment in and made orders that enabled
the plaintiff to receive the total amount of the original payment that had been made into court, together with interest accruing
on that amount from 25 March 2003.  In doing so, the Court of Appeal validated the notice of acceptance of payment in that had been
served within the prescribed time. 26.  The defendant elected not to file written submissions and the parties, very sensibly, filed a consent summons agreeing terms, including
the term that interest accrued on the sum of $63,000 after 25 November 2016 be paid to the plaintiff.  I make an order in terms of
the consent summons, as amended by me, as follows:",Date of Reasons for Decision: 17 January 2018(Mohan Bharwaney),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/92.html,"Mr Tim T. S. Kwok, instructed by Li & Lai, for the plaintiff",tim t. s. kwok,patrick d. lim,,Li & Lai,plaintiff,1.0
PAN SHI LIANG v. HARSEN INDUSTRIES LTD [2018] HKCFI 211; HCMP 1917/2017 (17 January 2018),"Harsen Industries Limited, the respondent, in person, absent","4.  The application came before me in November last years.  Although both the Company and Mr Wong had been given notice, no one appeared
at that hearing in opposition.  As a result of the questions I raised, however, the hearing was adjourned to today.  Those questions
have since been addressed, to my satisfaction, in the 3rd affirmation of Mr Pan and in the supplemental skeleton of Mr Leung who has appeared for Mr Pan.  Neither the Company nor Mr Wong
has appeared today to oppose the application.  5.  Since the matter is going forward and no opposing argument has been advanced, I will not go into the substantive claims in detail,
except to say that I accept Mr Leung’s submission, for the reasons he has given, that there are serious issues to be tried, which
is not a very high threshold, and that it appears prima facie to be in the interests of the Company that leave be granted given the remedies claimed are primarily damages and account for profits
which, if granted, would enure to the benefit of the Company.  I therefore grant leave for a statutory derivative action to be brought
and make an order in terms of paragraph 1 of the originating summons. 6.  As for costs, I think the applicant should have the costs of the application, but I am minded to order that he be indemnified as
to 75% of the costs of the application by the Company because of certain duplication and wastage of costs having regard to the need
for two hearings, which cannot all be laid at the door of the Company.  So far as the costs of the derivative action are concerned,
I will order that they be paid by the Company out of its assets up to the exchange of lists of documents by way of discovery.  So

The purpose of the two High Court actions is neither here nor there.  So long as Mr Poon remains the administrator pending suit,
he is under the duty to provide an account if so directed under the Order, and of course, pursuant to section 56 of the PAO.  Costs of preparation and furnishing of the account should no doubt come from the estate, and whether Mr Poon should
be ordered to pay the costs of this application is another matter.  Lastly, Mr Lau submits that there are practical difficulties
with the preparation of true, perfect and final accounts at this stage because of some complications.  9.  I am not in a position to assess the difficulties and the complexity of the preparation of the accounts, but it should not provide
a reason for an administrator not to provide an account, and the account, as fairly accepted by Mr Boey, counsel for Ms Tang, needs
not to be final.  All that Ms Tang wishes is the compliance of the duty of Mr Poon under section 56, and I see no reason why Mr Poon can escape such a duty.  10.  In the premises, I allow Ms Tang’s application and I would make an order that Mr Poon should make an affirmation exhibiting a
true and perfect inventory and account of the moveable and immoveable property of the estate of the Deceased pursuant to section 56 of the PAO and file the same to court within 35 days from today.  I will make no order as to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the originating

$10,000.  The assessed costs are to be paid by Chan Lai Lai within 21 days from the date hereof.  For the argument on costs, I do
not consider counsel’s service should be required.  I disallow counsel certificates for this hearing. 18.  I shall make an order on costs in terms as follows:","LOH SAI ( 陸熙), THE ADMINISTRATRIX OF

Further, having considered the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of L not to vary the
present access/residential arrangements during the period whenever one parent is away.  I therefore dismiss the Father’s summons. 15.  I have indicated at the hearing, the parents remain joint custodians of L, and will remind them that one parent should give the
other parent advance notice of his/her absence from Hong Kong. 16.  As for costs, the Father said he was seeking a clarification of the Court’s order, and in the end did not file any further affirmation

Before hearing counsel on how this petition should proceed and the issue of costs, I would like to deal with one procedural issue.
 The Companies Court has developed a standard order for the filing of submissions and hearing bundles.  The order, which is now well
known to solicitors and counsel regularly practising in the Companies Court, goes into some detail about the way in which hearing
bundles should be prepared.  It does this, first, because in my experience, far too many solicitors adopt a casual approach to the
preparation of hearing bundles, and secondly, because the directions are specifically intended to ensure not only that the hearing
bundles are put together in a sensible way, but more particularly that they include cross referencing which allows the court to locate
items such as exhibits referred to in affirmations quickly.  This enables the court to familiarise itself with the papers promptly
and in advance of the hearing.  As far too often happens, the solicitors in this case did not prepare the hearing bundles in accordance
with those directions.  19.  As I frequently make clear when making those directions, but unfortunately my exhortations seem too frequently to fall upon deaf
ears, it is important for solicitors and counsel to read the order and to ensure that the directions have been complied with. 20.

that payment.  In any event, given his liability to the plaintiff on the guarantee, it would be circuitous to set aside the credit
of HK$2.02m only for the Account’s debit balance to be increased by the same amount. 75.  For the above reasons, the defences raised all fail.  The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.  Judgment will be entered for the plaintiff
against both defendants jointly and severally in the sum of HK$24,466,180.31 together with interest from the date of the Writ of

operation.  The ground of appeal was that the sentence was excessive by reference to comparable cases in the magistrates’ courts.
In dismissing the appeal, M Poon J refused to have regards to such results in other magistrates’ courts supplied to her ladyship
by the appellants’ counsel, though such were case results of other Gambians arrested in the same police operation.  M Poon J said
she would only have authorities,not case results from magistracies.  Her Ladyship also brought to counsel’s attention to the case
of HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai HCMA 410/2008 (unreported, 26 June 2008).  It is noted that in that case, at para 11, for very small amount of heroin (less than
1 gramme), Saw J adopted the starting point of 2 years.  In the end, M Poon J dismissed the appeal (HCMA 153/2017) as the starting
point adopted by the sentencing magistrate was in line with R v Lau Tak Ming & anor [1990] 2 HKLR 370 and HKSAR v Au Kwok Chai (supra). 40.  In the present appeal, based on the above authorities, there is no doubt that the starting point of 24 months as enhanced by the
Magistrate was in line with the sentencing guidelines and was entirely proper in the circumstances.  As in the case of D1, there
were two separate offences and a partly consecutive sentence with an extra of 6 months’ sentence was therefore just and proper,
taking into account the principle of totality.  I entirely agree with the respondent that there is no merit in the appeal against
the sentences and they were neither wrong in principle or manifestly excessive. 41.  Accordingly, the appeal against sentence by D1 and D3 is also dismissed.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 26 January 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/144.html,"Mr Eddie Sean, SADPP of the Department of Justice, for the respondent",eddie sean,in person,,,defendant,0.0

Bearing in mind that the Magistrate in the present appeal is also an experienced professional judicial officer, it cannot be shown
that he made any error in law in his assessment of the credibility of the witness. 31.   Ground 2 also fails. 32.   The grounds of appeal are without merit and the appeal against conviction is dismissed accordingly.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 26 January 2018(Anthony Kwok),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/145.html,"Mr. Eddie Sean, SADPP of the Department of Justice, for the Respondent",eddie sean,philip ross,Mohnani & Associates,,defendant,0.0
"HKSAR v. PILINOVICS, MARTIN ANTHONY [2018] HKCFI 147; HCMA 510/2018 (21 December 2018)",The appellant appeared in person,"11.  The appellant has pleaded in this court that he suffers from a delusional disorder as he had been diagnosed in the UK and he said
that he had cut his wrist before coming to Hong Kong on his way to Taiwan to see his fiancée.  However, I do not see how that would
serve as proper mitigation in this case.  The fact is it was an opportunistic theft at the time he took the property from the lift.
 It was an opportunistic burglary when he climbed over the glass wall partition to steal the ticket and not only did he do it once,
he did it twice by climbing over that glass partition again and stealing the printer rolls. 12.  His second ground of appeal is that he asked for leniency to reduce the sentence so that he can go back to the UK to deal with matters
needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence. 13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There
is no merit to this appeal and so the appeal is dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

delay of the plaintiff’s current complaint, to show that the plaintiff’s case simply is unbelievable.  Again, I cannot determine
this question finally at this stage without a trial.  Thus, similarly, it is not appropriate for me to strike out the plaintiff’s
claim on this ground. 35.  In the circumstances, I make the following order:- 36.

    for the 2nd and 3rd respondents","20.  In these circumstances, I conclude that the just order that should be made in this case is that Mr Cao should have half of his costs
against Mr Lau who will be in a position to seek a contribution in respect of those from the other director and shareholder.  I make
no judicial determination that such a request for a contribution would be well-founded in law.  Nonetheless, it would clearly be
open to Mr Lau to seek a contribution from his co-minority shareholder since it seems highly likely that those twoshareholders were
acting jointly with respect to the filing of the Form ND2A.   21.  The outcome would be that, in effect, the costs of the Originating Summons are shared as between the all three of the disputant
parties; the applicant on the one side and the other two shareholders on the other.  Accordingly, for the reasons that I have given,
I will make an order that Mr Lau must pay half of Mr Cao’s costs of the Originating Summons, to be taxed if not agreed. 22.  This was a case where both sides were justified in seeking representation through counsel.  It involved some issues of law and analysis

the Tenancy Agreement was entered into in October 2015, and yet no audited accounts were provided by Ds apart from a “balance sheet”.
 No supporting evidence was provided by D2 and D3 as to their own financial position. 15.  P being the successful party should not be deprived of the fruits of its success.  Having considered the above and the submissions

Finally, I have also not overlooked the 2nd defendant’s allegation that she has difficulty in obtaining an expert opinion given that upon her report, the police is still investigating
the matter.  However, I do not see why the police investigation has caused any difficulty.  On the contrary, an expert opinion may
even assist the police investigation. 14.  It remains for me to say that I also agree with the plaintiff’s submissions that even if the 2nd defendant did not sign the 1st Facility Letter, she was still bound as a partner of the Firm or as someone held out as such: see sections 7 and 16 of the Partnership Ordinance (Cap 38).  The 2nd defendant complained that this is not the plaintiff’s pleaded case.  In my judgment, this is not pleaded because this partnership
point is raised only in relation to the defence raised by the 2nd defendant.  It is raised to say that even on the 2nd defendant’s own evidence, she could not succeed. 15.

MORN CREATIONS LTD v. SWIRE RESOURCES LTD [2018] HKCFI 179; HCA 1578/2017 (30 January 2018),"Mr Sebastian Hughes, instructed by Squire Patton Boggs, for the 2nd 
defendant","14.  The third ground concerns the defendant’s knowledge.  The defendant stressed that in the pre-action correspondence, the plaintiff
never told the defendant what copyright work the plaintiff was relying on, and thus there could not be any knowledge.  On the plaintiff’s
case, the Plaintiff’s Product had been issued earlier than the Defendant’s Product, and the plaintiff and the defendants were
competitors.  At this stage, I am not satisfied, with the defendant’s mere allegation of absence of knowledge, that it is plain
and obvious that the defendant had no knowledge of the requisite degree.  Thus, I also reject this ground. 15.  The last ground concerns the relief for an injunction.  The defendant argues that because the defendant has removed the Defendant’s
Products from sale in Hong Kong and undertook not to restock the Defendant’s Products, there is no practical need for an injunction.
 The plaintiff disagrees, pointing out that the defendant has made it clear that it would contest the plaintiff’s claim.  Further,
in any event, the undertaking was too vague and not enough to get in place of the injunctive relief being sought for.  In my judgment,
it is not so plain and obvious that there is no risk of the defendant’s selling the Defendant’s Product in the future.  On the
contrary, absent any undertaking, an order may still be necessary. 16.  In the circumstances, I dismiss the defendant’s summons.  I shall hear submissions on costs and directions.",Date of Handing Down of Written Decision : 30 January 2018(Gary C C Lam),Master of the High Court,/2018/179.html,"Mr Douglas Clark, instructed by Benny Kong & Tsai, for the plaintiff",douglas clark,sebastian hughes,Squire Patton Boggs,Benny Kong & Tsai,defendant,0.0

Other than the availability of the witnesses who will be in the position to give evidence on the communications between the Plaintiffs
and the Partners on the issue of the Plaintiffs’ alleged knowledge of the defects in the Right, the parties have not identified
other factors which are relevant to the consideration of the appropriate forum for the trial.  There are no issues raised concerning
the Transaction or the listing of DS in Hong Kong which require determination at trial.  No question of juridical advantage has been
raised. 33.  Having regard to all the matters identified in paragraphs 25 to 32 above, I have come to the inevitable conclusion that Hong Kong
is not the appropriate forum for the trial of this action, and that the judges in the Mainland courts, with their in-depth understanding
and knowledge of the relevant PRC laws, the policy considerations and the practices of the Mainland authorities, would be more familiar
with and be better able to decide the issues in dispute in this case.  The Partners have identified the Shanghai No 1 Intermediate
People’s Court, the Shanghai Xuhui District People’s Court or the Jiangxi High People’s Court as the relevant Mainland court
which is the more appropriate forum, depending on the nature and size of the Plaintiffs’ claim against the Partners. 34.  I accordingly grant the orders sought in the Partners’ summons, to set aside the Order and to stay these proceedings, on the basis
that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum for the trial of claims made in this action.  An order nisi will be made that the costs

in closure of account and legal action by the service provider.  Whilst it would not be a desirable situation, it cannot be equated
with diminution of assets.  The proper course was for Ma to negotiate a sensible solution with Hyundai Marine, failing which he might
apply to the court.  He was not entitled to take the matter into his own hands in the face of the Order.  70.  In the premises, there is no doubt that Ma had breached the Restriction on Disposal of Assets in respect of the payment of HK$916,950,

the girls, there were more girls, there was an element of illegal working and the scale of operation.  Further the applicable maximum
is now 10 years’ imprisonment.  For these reasons the sentence passed by the magistrate in this case may be said to be on the low
side.   30.  What discount is available to the appellant for the unreasonable delay in charging the appellant is however in my view offset by
the moderate sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment.  31.  For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal against sentence was dismissed.  The sentence was not manifestly excessive or wrong in principle.

 If I had not considered tracing to be a significant factor, would the balance have tilted in favour of Hong Kong as the appropriate
forum?  The answeris “yes”.  I remain of the view that the other factors set out in paragraph 41are more significant factors
in the context of this case than those relied upon by the 2nd defendant.  I remain of the view that the 2nd defendant failed to establish that Hong Kong is not the appropriate forum and that Singapore is clearly or distinctly more appropriate
than Hong Kong and I refer to paragraphs 40 to 44 of my Decision.  For this reason, I consider that the fourth ground of appeal does
not have a reasonable prospect of success. 31.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the defendants’ application for leave to appeal. 32.

merit for the defendants to question the approach then adopted by the Master with regard to costs.  As such, I decline an order of

and he said that the evidence was insufficient for him to be convicted of the charge and that the learned magistrate therefore should
not have found him guilty. 9.  In relation to the sentence, he said that the sentence was too long and asked for a reduction in sentence.  I have read the learned
magistrate’s Statement of Findings in relation to the conviction, she is the best person to find the facts as she had observed
all the witnesses giving evidence in court.  She had given the reasons for convicting the appellant of the charge and she had also
given reasons as to why she did not believe either the appellant or his witnesses.  I cannot find any error in her reasons for conviction
in law or in procedure and so there is no reason whatsoever to disturb her conviction in this case. 10.  In the relation to the sentence, the learned magistrate was only following the guideline in the case of HKSAR v Li Chang Li and 18 months’ imprisonment is appropriate, so both the appeal against conviction and sentence are dismissed.",Date of Judgment: 7 February 2018(E Toh),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/368.html,"Ms Elisa Cheng PP, of the Department of Justice, for the respondent",elisa cheng pp,in person,,,defendant,0.0

between early July 2016 to 31 May 2017.  The second appellant had been granted recognizance on 5 February 2016 and was told that
he cannot take up employment.  In considering sentence in relation to the second appellant, the learned magistrate had listened to
the mitigation put forward by his counsel and the fact that the second appellant had a clear record.  Again the learned magistrate
considered the case of HKSAR v Li Chang Li, HCMA 935/2004 and considered that the usual starting point for charge three is 22 and a‑half months.  As for charge four, the
learned magistrate considered the case of HKSAR v Usman Butt and another, HCMA 70/2010 that a starting point of 22 and a‑half months is appropriate, because the appellant had pleaded guilty, he reduced
the sentence to 15 months’ imprisonment.  Again, having considered the totality principle, the learned magistrate made both sentences
concurrent. 11.  The second appellant also complained that the sentences were too long and urged this court to reduce the sentences.  As I had indicated
above, the learned magistrate had already considered the salient points in the case and appropriately considered the sentencing guideline
and therefore at the end of the day had correctly sentenced in both charges which the second appellant faced. 12.  I cannot see there are any reasons to disturb the sentences and I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence of the second

an undervalue.  Indeed, the consideration provided by the Respondents exceeded the value of the Bankrupt’s interest in the Property,
which was assessed at HK$400,000 by the Trustees.  37.  Further, in light of the evidence of the Respondents, I cannot agree that the Transaction constituted an unfair preference by the
Bankrupt of his brothers.  The Transaction was not influenced by the Bankrupt’s desire to favour his brothers in the event of his
bankruptcy, but by the Bankrupt’s desire to get out of the financial hole in which he found himself.  I find the presumption under
s.50(5) of the Ordinance, which is relied upon by the Trustees, rebutted.  38.  For these reasons, the Summons is dismissed, and I make an order nisi that the costs of and occasioned by the Summons, including

Having regard to all the matters considered above and to the factors mentioned in §16 above, I am of the view that the risk of
dissipation in the present case is real.  Assessed objectively, the paper company utterance, made in the circumstances set out above,
is undeniably a threat that any pursuit for repayment of the funds would be futile.  The fact that the only known assets consists
of monies in a bank account, the risk of dissipation looms large.    41.  When that is coupled with the manner in which the defendant has seen fit to conduct itself following the August agreement, including
the threat to lock the devices supplied, it is appropriate to order that the 2nd Mareva injunction be continued until after trial of the action or further order. 42.  There is to be an order nisi that the costs of the 2nd inter partes summons (including the costs of the hearing on 22 August and 24 August 2016 hearing) and the costs referred to in §14(vi)(3) above

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. CHEONG KAI TJIEH AUGUSTINE AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 437; HCA 2269/2012 (22 February 2018),The 1st defendant appeared in person,"5.  Mr Cheong did raise a technical issue before me, namely, whether or not section 49 of the High Court Ordinance, Cap 4, applies at all to the order made on 13 March 2017, although he accepted that the consent summons necessarily provided that
the judgment rate of interest would be paid for at least the period specified in the summons.  It seems to me quite clear that section 49 does apply to the order.  This is dealt with in the commentary to the Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2018: see paras 42/1/6 and 42/1/11.  It seems to me clear that the statutory rate of interest on a judgment applies to a registered order
of the Tribunal from the date on which the order contained in the report handed down by the Tribunal is made. 6.  It is clearly desirable that applications of this sort are dealt with promptly as they will not normally be controversial.  As I
have already indicated, it seems to me that it is not appropriate or necessarily efficient for the applications to be dealt with
in writing, although it is desirable that the parties agree the terms of the order that is sought from the court and that an application
for a short expedited hearing is made in order that the mechanism for implementing the orders of the Tribunal can be made promptly
and, if they involve the payment of money, that interest does not continue to run for an unnecessarily extended period.  7.  I will therefore make an order in the terms of the revised draft handed up by Mr Dawes which updates the interest calculation until
22 February 2018. Interest will, however, continue to accrue until the actual date of transfer, although I anticipate that the Commission
will be able to have the order perfected and the payment out of court made very promptly.",Date of Decision: 22 February 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/437.html,"Mr Victor Dawes SC and Mr Roger Phang, instructed by the Securities and Futures Commission, the plaintiff",roger phang,in person,,,unknown,

The defendant complained that but for Chan’s misconduct, he would have been able to check the accuracy of the amount of the Bank’s
claim and settled the matter at the hearing before Master Leong such that allcosts which he was ordered to pay in this action would
not have been incurred and wasted.  This argument is disingenuous.  His challenge about the accuracy was only raised after Master
Leong had entered the Order 88 Judgment.  As Deputy Judge Poon held, his request for statements and records was just a delaying tactic
and that the calculations were correct.  These findings were all upheld on appeal.  His conduct throughout these proceedings indicated
that his sole intention behind his request for bank statements and records was to delay the legal process with his repeated unmeritorious
appeals and applications to stay.  He had no intention to pay.  His argument that had he been given the statements and records he
would have settled the action is artificial and disingenuous.  The legal costs he sought to recover under the wasted costs order
were costs he was ordered to pay for his losing the action. He only had himself to blame for taking such an obstinate course.  Those
costs fall outside the scope of the wasted costs.  25.  The defendant claims the difference between interest on the outstanding amount calculated at judgment rate and the contractual rate.
 He has not advanced any ground for this claim.  In any event, it is outside thescope of the wasted costs order provisions.  There
is no issue about Chan’s conduct which justifies the court’s exercise of its wasted costs jurisdiction. 26.  For the above reasons, there is no evidence that Chan acted improperly or was guilty of misconduct in the prosecution of the proceedings.
 The defendant has failed even to satisfy the court that he has passed first stage required for the court to consider exercising
the wasted costs order jurisdiction.  His wasted costs order application is bound to fail.  Suffice it is to say that to insist to
pursue a cause of action which is bound to fail is a clear abuse of proceedings.  The defendant’s summons should therefore be struck
out as an abuse of the process of the court and with costs to Chan Ning Chun Charles on indemnity basis.",Date of Decision: 23 February 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/396.html,The defendant appeared in person,in person,justin lam,,,defendant,0.0

The test of dissipation of assets is objective. The Court is concerned with the effect of the defendant’s conduct as opposed to
the motives underlying the conduct.  So it is not necessary to show that a defendant would remove his assets out of reach of the
plaintiff for the purpose of defeating any judgment that the plaintiff might obtain against him.  However, the mere fact that the conduct of a defendant is likely
to deplete his assets available for judgment is not sufficient.  A defendant is entitled to incur expenses in going about his ordinary
life or business, repay his genuine debts as they fall due, and to spend money in defending himself against the plaintiff’s claim.
 It has never been the purpose of a Mareva injunction to give to a plaintiff security over a defendant’s assets in priority to
other creditors.  Something more than a real risk that the judgment will go unsatisfied is required.  (See TTMI Ltd of England v ASM Shipping Ltd of India [2006] 1 Llyod’s Rep 401.) Despite the tendency to refer to a defendant’s alleged “unacceptably low standard of commercial
morality” as the basis for seeking a Mareva injunction, the courts have warned against too readily drawing inferences of a real
risk of dissipation from the conduct of a defendant. 6.  In this case, even if the 1st Defendant’s sale of his property may have the effect that the property or its proceeds would be out of the Plaintiff’s reach
in the eventual execution of any judgment in his favour, it cannot be established that such sale would have the effect of depleting
the 1st Defendant’s assets which would otherwise be available for execution of the judgment: since the sale and the use of the proceeds of sale are shown to be for legitimate purposes: of discharging
the 1st Defendant’s obligations under the various court orders made against him, including his liability to the Plaintiff, and for legitimate
expenses in and consequential to the sale.  There is no sound basis to draw the inferences which the Plaintiff has asked the court
to draw against the 1st Defendant’s series of conduct outlined, including his petition for divorce. 7.  The injunction is discharged and the Summons for its continuation is dismissed, with costs to be paid by the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant.

A debt which is subject to a contingency which cannot arise if the company is insolvent in my view cannot be admitted to proof.
 The reasons for this are apparent from paras 68 to 71 of Lord Neuberger’s decision in Re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (No 4) [2017] UKSC 38; [2017] 2 WLR 1497, the facts of which are to the extent relevant apparent from these paragraphs:  7.  If the contingency cannot arise in the event of the winding up and, therefore, cannot be admitted to proof, it is artificial to
characterise the creditor as a contingent creditor.  The correct analysis in my view is that for the purposes of section 179(1) he
is not a creditor at all.  A creditor must be somebody whose debts can properly be admitted to proof even if the debt is valued at
a nominal amount pending a final determination of its value, which may depend on the occurrence of a contingency.  If the claim cannot
properly be admitted to proof at all, the claim cannot sensibly be characterised as a contingent debt.  In order for the debt to
be contingent, there must be some possibility of the contingency occurring.  If necessarily it cannot if a winding-up order is made,
there is no longer a contingency and, therefore, no longer a contingent debt.  8.  For this reason, I conclude that the petitioner is not a contingent creditor or a creditor at all and, therefore, did not have locus to present the petition, which I will therefore dismiss and make a costs order nisi that the petitioner pays the Opposing Contributory’s costs of the petition, and that the Official Receiver’s costs are paid out
of the petitioner’s deposit, the balance of which shall be returned to the petitioner.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/641.html,"Mr Tom Ng, instructed by Li & Partners, for the petitioner",tom ng,edward chan,Brandon Luk & Co,Li & Partners,defendant,0.0
ERWIANA SULISTYANINGSIH v. TSUI YUN BUN BARRY AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 463; HCA 2256/2015 (2 March 2018),"Written submissions in reply by Mr Tony Ko, instructed by Boase Cohen & Collins, for the plaintiff	  ","25.  The 1stdefendant then says that my finding that he also had the intention of defrauding creditors was part and parcel of the finding against
the 2nd defendant, with no additional costs incurred for the finding against him.  This is not correct because a judgment against him is
as I said indispensable given that he was the transferee under the Transfer and until the Judgment the sole owner of the Property.
 The 1st defendant must be liable for the costs incurred to obtain the Judgment against him (jointly and severally with the 2nd defendant in so far as any costs were incurred against them in common).  The fact that no additional costs were incurred is irrelevant. 26.  In so far as Mak Ngun Tai is concerned, in my judgment it is distinguishable.  In a case like the present, the 1st defendant, found to have shared the relevant intention for the Transfer to be set aside, was responsible for the plaintiff’s need
to commence, and to proceed with, the action and, after the withdrawal, whatever was done by the plaintiff to obtain judgment against
him.  In Mak Ngun Tai, however, which was an application for the appointment of an administrator pendate lite, there was no suggestion that the 2nd defendant was responsible for the fact that the application was being made by the plaintiffs, or the need for the application to
proceed to a hearing.  I do not read that judgment as laying down any general rule that a party, having taken a neutral stance, would
not be liable for any costs.  Each case must depend on its own facts and the court must exercise its discretion on costs accordingly. 27.  For the above reasons, I make the following order in place of the costs order made in §63 of the Judgment, namely that the 1st and the 2nd defendants are jointly and severally liable for and do pay the costs of this action to the plaintiff, to be taxed if not agreed.
 I also make an order nisi that the 1st defendant is also to pay the costs of the plaintiff in this application for variation of the costs order.  The plaintiff’s own

LAW LAI LAN v. TAMANG PREM CHANDR [2018] HKCFI 536; HCMP 2402/2017 (5 March 2018),The Respondent acted in person,"47.  The only truly mitigating factor is his admission of non-compliance with the order at the hearing on 30 November 2017.  Of course,
the facts were such that he could not but to admit.  48.  Mr How asks for an unspecified term of imprisonment.  Recalcitrant as the Respondent is, this is not the worst type of case that
calls for such a draconian measure.  The applicant’s claim in the main action from which this contempt arose is about $3.5 million.
 It is not a proprietary claim and the applicant is not entitled to tracing.  There is nothing to suggest that the applicant would
suffer additional damage if the contempt is not purged.  Some disclosure has, somehow, been made and bank accounts identified, from
which some recourse could be made.  A fixed term imprisonment with liberty to apply for a review upon the contemnor’s purging the
contempt is appropriate. 49.  The contempt, as I have found, was willful and contumelious.  The Respondent’s conduct was recalcitrant.  I consider a starting
point of twelve months’ imprisonment appropriate.  The Respondent’s admission deserves some mitigation, but that is more than
wiped off by the aggravating factor I mentioned above.  Accordingly, I pass a sentence of twelve months’ imprisonment which shall
take into account the time he was remanded in custody pending sentence.  This sentence is to be served consecutively to the sentence
of 28 days’ imprisonment for common assault which he is currently serving.  I also order costs against the Respondent on indemnity
basis.","Date of Judgment:

RE RAD SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES ASIA LTD [2018] HKCFI 610; HCCW 253/2017 (7 March 2018),"Mr Alexsander Wong, instructed by Chong & Partners LLP, for the company","5.  There is nothing from the Company, either in the form of contemporaneous emails or letters, or affirmation evidence, which indicates,
and indeed I do not understand it to be the Company’s case, that it has rejected the irradiator.  It seems to me to be quite clear
that the Company has had ample opportunity and time to decide whether or not such problems as may have been identified on 13 April
2017 were sufficiently serious to justify rejecting the irradiator, and having not done so, the Company must be treated as having
accepted the irradiator and therefore is, on the face of the matter, liable to pay the contract price. 6.  The second ground for arguing that the debt is not payable is that the alleged oral agreement to which I have referred.  Mr Hartman
in his affidavits denies that any such agreement was ever reached. There is no reference to it in anything written during the material
periods by either the petitioner or the Company.  It seems to me to be inherently unlikely that the petitioner would have agreed
simply to leave such an expensive device in the Mainland without requiring at least partial payment.  There is an additional matter
which, it seems to me, calls into question both the likelihood of such an agreement ever having been reached and the bona fides of Mr Zhao’s evidence in this regard, namely, that it is the undisputed evidence of the petitioner that it has been told that CEIEC
has paid 90% of the contract price.  Although the petitioner does not know when payment took place, it seems to me that this being
the case is inconsistent with the suggested agreement advanced by the Company as a ground for deferring payment.  7.  In conclusion, it seems to me that a bona fide defence on substantial grounds, which is the criteria that needs to be satisfied by the Company in order to successfully oppose the
petition, has not been demonstrated.  As a consequence, there is clearly more than the statutory minimum required to support the
petition, and I will therefore make the normal winding-up order which will include an order that the Company pays the petitioner’s
costs.  I understand that on 23 February 2018 the petitioner paid HK$250,000 into court by way of security for costs.  I order that
that sum be paid to the petitioner.",Date of Decision: 7 March 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/610.html,"Ms Connie Lee, instructed by Deacons, for the petitioner",connie lee,alexsander wong,Chong & Partners LLP,Deacons,unknown,

After reading the whole Statement of Findings, I must say the criticism by the appellants on this ground is misconceived.  I totally
agree with the submission by the respondent that the complaint was unfounded and in my view, it was just a matter of expression and
interpretation by the Magistrate.  There is no doubt that all the Magistrate was trying to say was that the only possible inference
he can draw was employment as there was not even an iota of evidence which indicated any other alternative relationship.  The Magistrate
has not reversed the burden of proof as contended by the appellants.  Accordingly, this ground also fails. 40.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that the there is no substance nor any merit in any ground of appeal advance on behalf of the
two appellants.  The inference that the two appellants were taking employments at the material times was one the Magistrate was fully
entitled to draw in light of the circumstantial evidence in this case.  Despite the able submissions made on the appellants’ behalf,
I find no basis to interfere with the Magistrate’s finding of facts and the conclusion that he has reached.  41.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

The Prosecution had not made clear at the beginning on what basis the GMP guidelines were relied upon.  Instead, the statement of
Mr William Chui (provided shortly before the trial) was intended to be used by the Prosecution.  That being the case, it cannot be
said that the challenge was improperly mounted.  The defence was in fact successful in obtaining a ruling that Mr William Chui was
not permitted to give opinion on the law.  With the concession made by the Prosecution during the hearing of the submissions, it
then became clear on what basis the Prosecution intended to rely on the GMP guidelines.  As a result of this Court’s ruling on
the limited use of these guidelines, D1 and D2 produced documents relating to GMP guidelines in their defence. 66.  In these circumstances, I do not agree that D1 and D2 had unjustifiably challenged the relevance of the GMP.  D1 and D2 will not

that Mr Chun was the ultimate beneficial owner of the Chung Shing HK and the 2 Mainland subsidiaries.  Although the Fung Report was
deficient and Ds did not provide confirmation of any matters as required under the 17.08.15 Order, Ps should have been aware that
committal should be a last resort.  They should have considered other alternatives rather than proceeding with the contempt proceedings
against Ds which turned out to be fruitless.  In fact, in the 18.11.16 Judgment, this Court found that in light of the Receivership
Order, there was an alternative way or a viable alternative for Ps to procure the necessary information through the Receivers appointed

my conclusion on the Third Disclosure Application, because the question that I have to decide is not whether the 5th Defendant is acting within the powers conferred by the BVI Court Order, or its directors have actual or ostensible authority, to
oppose the application, but whether I should exercise my discretion to order RSRB to disclose the information and documents sought

I would only add that, as stated by the Court of Appeal, the 5th Defendant is not bound, at least as a matter of Hong Kong law, to adopt a neutral stance in respect of interlocutory applications

Throughout the years, HL’s very substantial debt of about $8 million was gradually reduced to $1,227,013 by accounting manipulations.
 In 2004, a very profitable logistic business was created forto serve HIECL which HIECL could have operated on its own.  By consciousdecision,
HIECL passed a resolution to pay HL exorbitant handling charges of $280,000 per year for the use of its banking facilities which
it could also have obtained by mortgaging the two car parking spaces and use of trust receipts facilities.  A very substantial debt
of $4,704,868.64 was treated as having been repaid by accounting manoeuvre without HL or any of its four directors contributing funds
to make the payment.  These accounting manoeuvres only brought about internal reallocation of assets within two companies.  They
served no commercial purpose except to reduce HL’s debtowed to HIECL.  141.  Despite the substantial debt, HL with its banking facilitieswas used as the treasury of the family business. The assets of HL were
used freely for the purpose of HIECL, including funds and trading-in of HL’s Toyota Alphard.  The logistic business was then transferred
to HIECL in 2007 for no consideration, shortly before the split, to insulate that asset from possible execution in a pending litigation.
 This shows that the assets of the two companies are treated as common or mutual assets.  Though the two companies were separate
legal entities, all these indicate that they formed an integral part of the same family business.  If they were truly separate entities,
HIECL could have allowed HL to be wound up in 1998 on failing to pay compensation to the property developer.  From the accounting
treatment of the accounts of these two companies and Chui’s own evidence, I find that until the split, these two companies were
operated as integral parts of one family business.  The debt incurred in 1998 was also the debt of the family business.  142.  When HL’s debt owing to HIECL is viewed against the above background, I have no difficulties to draw the inference that from the
time it was created in 1998, there was no intention that it shall be repaid as if it were a debt contracted at arms’ length.  All
repayments since the creation ofthe debt were just accounting manipulations or internal asset redistribution for business purposes,
such as bookkeeping or tax avoidance.  In the course of discussion about the split, Joe readily agreed to HIECL waiving the debt.
 His agreement is another confirmation of this common intention.  As for HL’s acknowledgment of the debt in its audited report
for the year ended 31 March 2009, Chung Yee explained that he was bound to make the acknowledgement because the debt could not be
removed save by synchronized act of both companies.  Obviously, HIECL was not prepared to take synchronized action.  Indeed, it even
sought to enforce the debt.  I accept his explanation.  Accordingly, I find that the common intention of HL and HIECL was and has
always been that the debt need not be repaid.  For the above reason, HIECL’s claim is dismissed with costs.","Total:

I am prepared to abridge CLA’s time for serving its inter partes summons, because there is no reason to suppose that it was not just overlooked.  I assume that CLA’s legal team thought that the
issue of the originating summons returnable on 16 March was sufficient.  In any event, no prejudice was suffered by Leighton.  Mr
Zimmern was able to marshal all his arguments despite having insufficient notice of the filing of the summons.  The same applies
to the amendment of the summons.  I give leave for the summons to be amended.  I imagine that the desirability of claiming the alternative
relief was only appreciated when Mr Kat joined CLA’s legal team, and again Mr Zimmern was able to deal with the amendment. 31.  However, for the reasons I have endeavoured to give, I discharge the order made by Deputy Judge To, and I dismiss CLA’s applications
for (a) a new order in the terms of the previous one or (b) an order in the terms of the alternative relief sought by CLA.  At the
conclusion of the hearing, I continued the order of Deputy Judge To until judgment on the summonses before me was handed down in
order to maintain the status quo for the time being.  It goes without saying that the continuation of the order for these few days does not affect the dismissal of
CLA’s applications. 32.  I turn to costs.  At present I see no reason why CLA should not pay to Leighton its costs of and occasioned by both summonses, to
be taxed if not agreed, and I make an order nisi to that effect. However, I am not inclined to order that those costs be taxed on the indemnity basis.  There is no reason to think
that this was a deliberate attempt to steal an unfair march on Leighton.  On the contrary: there is every reason to suppose that
there was here a genuinely, albeit misguided, belief that there was nothing more to disclose than what was being disclosed.

I am of the view that the circumstances of the present case do not justify the Court exercising its discretion to proceed to have

him with an indictable offence.  He was granted bail which allowed him to return and reside in Australia but on condition and on
his undertaking to return to Hong Kong for trial.  Strict adherence to the legal obligations on an accused by statute or court order
is fundamental to the administration of justice.  There are no exceptional or extenuating circumstances in the present case that
do not require the physical presence of the accused at his arraignment.  72.  In light of the foregoing, the application is therefore refused.

and hence acted in self-defence.  63.  The magistrate’s omission to analyse and consider the compelling video evidence sufficiently, renders the conviction unsafe and
unsatisfactory.  The appeal against conviction for both charges are allowed and the convictions for charges 4 and 5 are accordingly

in an appropriate case, and that (on the basis that I was assured that all three counsel previously engaged would continue to be

1.  By an amended creditor’s bankruptcy petition, the petitioner seeks an adjudication of the debtor as a bankrupt.
2.  The debtor, Mr Yip, opposes the petition by a document entitled “[t]he grounds to show cause”, produced as Exhibit 1 to an affidavit
filed on 14 February 2018. 
3.  He filed another affidavit on 27 March 2018, exhibiting another document called “[r]evised cause against bankruptcy petition”.
 He confirmed to me this morning that he only relied on the grounds in the second document as the grounds in the first documents
are also contained in the second. 
4.  The ground of the amended petition is set out in its paragraph 2.  It is based on the judgment I made on 30 June 2015 in HCA 356/2006
requiring Mr Yip to pay the petitioner US$350,000 or its Hong Kong dollar’s equivalent at the time of payment with interest at
2.5 per cent above the best lending rate of the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, from 9 April 2009 until judgment,
and thereafter at judgment rate until payment, and costs of the petitioner in that action to be taxed. 
5.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the amended petition further say that the debt abovementioned is a liquidated sum payable immediately and
the debtor appeared to be unable to pay it.  The petitioner had served a statutory demand dated 25 October 2017 on the debtor, which
demand has not been complied with, or set aside, and no application for its setting-aside is outstanding.
6.  I held in paragraphs 343 to 350 of the judgment in HCA 356/2009 that the debtor had practised various misrepresentations on the
petitioner, which caused the petitioner to pay the debtor US$350,000 for the purchase of the controlling shares of a US corporation
called Tabatha V Inc.  I further held that the petitioner had rescinded the contract for his purchase of the Tabatha V shares.  He
sought repayment of the US$350,000 by the debtor.  He also undertook to the court to take all steps necessary to revert the Tabatha
V shares registered in his name back to the transferor of the shares upon receiving the sum of US$350,000 and interest thereon. 
7.  I gave judgment to the petitioner upon the undertaking of the petitioner that upon the petitioner receiving the US$350,000 and interest
thereon as adjudged, the petitioner do take all necessary steps to revert the shares in Tabatha V Inc that are registered in the
petitioner’s name to the transferor. 
8.  I then adjudged that judgment be for the petitioner and his company, the 2nd defendant therein, on the claim and the counterclaim,
and that the debtor and his company (named as the 2nd plaintiff in that action) do pay the petitioner the sum of US$350,000 or its
Hong Kong dollar’s equivalent at the time of payment with interest, at 2.5 per cent above the best lending rate of the said bank
from 9 April 2009 until judgment, and at judgment rate thereafter until payment. 
The debtor’s grounds
9.  The debtor in his “[r]evised cause against bankruptcy petition” said that:

“the judgment essentially requires of the following steps:
1. Upon this “undertaking”, YIP Chi Him Roger (“YIP”) is to pay the money US$350,000 plus interest to Lee, and
2. Upon receiving this money, Lee is to return the shares of Tabatha V Inc to YIP.
This is an order for a two-way exchange of shares and money between the two parties, not a one-way payment of money from one party to the other. The money amount
mentioned in the petition is not a “debt” but a payment upon an undertaking to transfer shares back to the payor”.

10.  He further submitted that:

“The ultimate objective of this order is to achieve refund for property returned (i.e. the shares). There is no detail in the order
for the question of how long the time lag should be for the return of property after payment, but it cannot be forever, nor never.
It is not about the time and sequence, but the ultimate objective of the order that matters; and it is all about achieving refund
and returning property.
Any one-way enforcement of the order must be wrong.
1. The property can be sold for money. The price of this property has also appreciated in value - and the rate of appreciation is
huge due to excessive demand from Chinese companies wishing to go public in the US and the current economic boom (vs. the bust years
at the time of litigation, i.e. the sub-prime mortgage crisis during December 2007 - June 2009);
2. If payment without return of property was allowed, this would imply that the property could be kept and sold by the petitioner
for extra money. This would also imply that the property could even be sold later, or now, or before judgment issuance, or before
trial, by the petitioner, who then still ask for refund. All such scenarios result in double compensation to the petitioner.
Therefore, payment without return of property is unjust.
No matter what the status of registration of Tabatha’s shares at the US Securities Exchange Commission (“the SEC”) is, the property
(i.e. the shares) has to be in existence - this is the absolute minimum requirement. Hence, there has to be evidential proof for
ownership. In the present case, this would mean:
1. a brokerage company issuing the latest shareholders’ list that includes the name and number of shares owned;
2. indication by the official transfer agent (Madison Stock Transfer Inc.), that the shares can be transferred via a proper process
of share transfer.
However, the petitioner has never tried to mention about any proof of ownership and transferability. Recall that his representative
lawyer told the Master in court on 14 February 2018 that the petitioner could clear some procedures of paying back some due fees
and fines for getting the shares back, he should have shown proof for such procedures’ validity in a next meeting or by now; however,
he has not mentioned about such matters again since then.
…
In conclusion, the petitioner has not properly followed the judgment order; hence it should be rejected.”

11.  The effect of the petitioner’s undertaking and my judgment is that after the debtor has paid the judgment debt of US$350,000 plus
interest, the petitioner should perform his undertaking of reverting the shares to the transferor.  However, Mr Yip, in his grounds
that I have recited above, tried to turn my judgment and the plaintiff’s undertaking into simultaneous steps of exchange, to be
undertaken by the parties.  That is a wrong interpretation of my judgment and the plaintiff’s undertaking. 
12.  In fact, the debtor had made a similar submission to the Court of Appeal in CACV 174/2015, when he appealed against my judgment.
 The Court of Appeal said in paragraphs 54 and 56 of the judgment that:

“54. Also, the terms of the undertaking of the 1st Defendant only oblige him to take all steps necessary to revert the Tabatha shares registered in his name to the company of the 1st Plaintiff, BVI Capital upon receiving the US$350,000. Two points emerge from this. First, the Plaintiffs have not yet paid the US$350,000
and the 1st Plaintiff told us that he had no means to pay. Second, the fact that Tabatha was not registered at SEC does not mean that the shares
could not be reverted to BVI Capital if such payment is made.
…
56. Hence we do not accept the 1st Defendant could not perform his obligations under the undertaking.  We do not see any unfairness in the judgment in this respect.”

13.  In the premises, the debtor’s grounds of opposition have no merit.  I therefore make an order in terms of the amended petition,
with costs of the amended petition be paid by the debtor.

the evidence I have referred to above addresses.  The amendments proposed to be made to [15] flesh out the averment in sub-para (3)
and describe the advice the Board received and, which it appears largely determined the offer price.  It is hardly a surprise that
the Board took advice from investment bankers on an appropriate offer price and that the Board was largely guided by what it was
told.  Excluding evidence about this would leave the court with an incomplete picture of what took place.  What seems to have happened
is that neither party has properly understood the other sides’s case and that the sooner it is clear from the pleadings what each
party contend and evidence is prepared to address the arguments and counter-arguments the better.  If, as may be the case, the real
issues are (a) whether the method of pricing the shares was wrong and resulted in an underpricing and (b) the Board was negligent
in not recognising this; the sooner this becomes clear and relevant evidence adduced the better. 10.  I will, therefore, allow the amendments and dismiss the summons to strike out the contentious evidence.  The costs of and occasioned
by the amendments be to the Plaintiff in any event.  So far as the costs of the two summonses are concerned I will make an order
nisi that the costs of both be in the cause with a certificate for two counsel.  I consider that this is an appropriate order given that
the applications have been contentious because in my view of a degree of confusion to which both parties have to some degree contributed. 11.  If further directions are required for the conduct of the Action or the current directions require amendment the parties should
approach my Clerk to fix an early case management conference.","CNT GROUP LIMITED

SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION v. ANDREW LIU AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 1105; HCMP 2653/2016 (13 April 2018),"Mr Ambrose Ho SC and Mr Jeff Chan, instructed by the Securities and Futures Commission, for the petitioner","5.  I do not accept that that is the correct approach.  An assessment of whether or not it was reasonable for the application to be
made would seem to me to necessitate of itself an independent assessment of the strength of an application or opposition to an application,
and would simply be an invitation for parties to embark on peripheral applications which would only add time and expense to legal
proceedings.  It seems to me that generally where an interlocutory application has been clearly determined in one party’s favour,
then almost invariably the successful party will be entitled to its costs, and that it will only be in unusual circumstances that
there will be reason for the court to order differently and for there to be any justification in a party inviting the court to undertake
a review of the application and the circumstances in which it came to be made.  Parties should be advised that this is the basis
on which costs will be ordered and assess whether or not to instruct an application to be made or opposed on this basis. 6.  I therefore will not vary my original costs order. 7.  Mr Ambrose Ho SC, who appeared with Mr Jeff Chan for the SFC, has asked for the costs of this application to be ordered on an indemnity
basis.  I will not make that order.  I will simply order that Mr Best pays the SFC’s costs with a certificate for one counsel forthwith.
 I would however note, that it does not seem to me that there is much, if any, substance in this application, and that if a further
application is to be made in these or other proceedings on the same, in my view, misconceived basis, I might be more inclined to
order indemnity costs.",Date of Decision: 13 April 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1105.html,"Mr Steven Kwan, instructed by Norton Rose Fulbright Hong Kong, for the 8th respondent",steven kwan,jeff chan,,,defendant,0.0

However, even if my analysis of the date of knowledge was wrong and the application was time barred, I would still exercise the

 Even if Mr. Chan found it difficult to locate the 3 co‑workers, as his main defence must be that he and the plaintiff were some
sort of “business partners” (and not employer/employee), I would think that the co-workers would unlikely be witnesses to such
a business agreement. In any case, the prejudice against the plaintiff of not being able to claim against a potential employer far
outweighs any prejudice against Chan. 31.  Accordingly, I would grant order in terms of paragraphs 1 to 10 of the Summons. 32.

I am satisfied that the police at that stage had not gathered evidence which would afford reasonable grounds for suspecting that

read to her and explained.  17.  After careful consideration of all the evidence relating to the manner and circumstances in which the statement was taken, including
the allegations made by the 1st defendant, that having due regard for the 1992 Rules and Directions for the Questioning of Suspects, I was satisfied as to its voluntary
nature, and further satisfied that there is no other ground upon which I should exercise my discretion to exclude it.  I found that
the allegations made against the police officers involved in or connected to the taking of the statement were making general inquiries

 by Benjamin Au & Billy Chan for the 1st and 2nd defendants","157.  Mr Li SC made a final complaint that the terms of the 19/12/17 Order looked quite different from the Proposed Directions. I note
PRC Yunnan Tin was the only party who proactively made proposals for disposal of the joinder applications, and it invited alternative
proposals by P and/or Ds (see paragraphs 23 and 28 above). In my view, there was nothing in Mr Li SC’s contention. The 19/12/17
Order took into account the state of progress of and other outstanding matters in the present litigation, and weaved a case management
timetable to fit in those matters (including the Expert Summons). But this did not detract from the fact that PRC Yunnan Tin achieved
substantial success in respect of the PRCYT Summons. 158.  Having considered all the circumstances and for all the above reasons, I consider that costs should follow the event save that a
discount is made to reflect the matters in paragraphs 155-156 above. I therefore order that P shall pay PRC Yunnan Tin 80% of the
costs of and occasioned by the PRCYT Summons (including costs of the 3rd Hearing on 19 December 2017 and all costs reserved if any) to be taxed forthwith if not agreed with certificate for two counsel. 159.  Although Mr Li SC suggested it might not be appropriate to have certificate for two counsel, the complexity of the matter as explained
in this decision spoke to the propriety of having two counsel. I also note P also engaged two counsel to resist Ds’ and PRC Yunnan
Tin’s applications for costs.","(b)            
the PRCYT Summons overlapped with Ds’ Joinder and Amended Joinder Summonses which were disclosed to PRC Yunnan Tin on 7 March 2017
(see paragraph 13 above) well before PRC Yunnan Tin issued the PRCYT Summons on 10 April 2017, so PRC Yunnan Tin as “putative party”
could have simply filed evidence in support of Ds’ joinder application and asked to be heard at the 3rd Hearing without making any separate application.(Marlene Ng)",Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/766.html,"Mr C Y Li SC and Mr Adrian But, instructed by Vincent T K Cheung Yap &

Lastly, I note that there is a suggestion that the Plaintiffs’ claims are or may be barred by acquiescence or unconscionable conduct
(see paragraph 82 of Mr Wong’s skeleton skeletons).  The factual matters relied upon in support of this defence, namely, those
set out in paragraphs 74 to 78 of Mr Sze’s Affirmation, are not referred to in the Defence filed on 20 February 2016.  I do not
consider that the Defendants should be permitted to rely on such defence which has not been pleaded or adequately pleaded.  In any
event, the matters relied upon by Mr Sze have been adequately explained by Ms Kang Lili in paragraphs 15 to 19 of her Second Affirmation,
and I do not consider that the defence of acquiescence or unconscionable conduct has substance. 43.  For the foregoing reasons, I find in favour of the Plaintiffs on the passing off claim, and make an order in terms of paragraphs
6 to 15 and 17 of the revised draft order annexed to Au-Yeung, Cheng, Ho & Tin’s letter to the court dated 4 January 2018 (save
that all references to the trade mark infringement claim shall be removed).  44.  In relation to the question of costs, I make an order nisi that the Defendants shall pay 70% of the Plaintiffs’ costs of and occasion by the Plaintiffs’ summons dated 15 March 2017, including
all reserved costs, to be taxed if not agreed with certificate for one counsel.  The reduction is made on account of the fact that

The defendant spent quite some time trying to establish that the plaintiff had not done their job properly. The plaintiff gave her
wrong advice, including agreeing to the offset of a total of $5 million provided by her husband by way of litigation funding. The
plaintiff strongly denied any of them. As I discussed these matters with both counsel at the hearing, all these disputes could not
be decided at the hearing before me and by way of affidavit evidence. They were not to be determined at the taxation herein, even
if taxation would be ordered by the court. Parties would have to resolve them by other appropriate procedures elsewhere. 32.  I have not had the benefit of arguments from parties as to the question of costs. It of course follows event unless there are circumstances
to the contrary. In our present case, the plaintiff wins in the argument on common law jurisdiction of the court and successfully
defends for taxation of 4 bills. On the other hand, the defendant has persuaded me to refer 6 bills for taxation. She only dropped
her argument that all bills were interim at the hearings before me. The time and costs spent by both parties are more or less the

magistrate’s finding that the appellant was acquitted as she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s
judgment was not affected by her eye-diseases as exactly disclosed and supported by those three medical reports which were already
within the knowledge of the prosecution even before the trial.  During the trial, neither was the medical evidence of DW2 challenged
by the prosecution nor did the prosecution call upon their own expert to testify in reply.  Based on the reason of the acquittal,
despite the adverse findings against the appellant by the magistrate, the prosecution case was inherently weak and the prosecution
has not discharged the burden and failed to prove whether the appellant knew or believed she was making a false claim and thereby
misleading the police. Based on the reasons of the acquittal, it would also seem that the whole trial was unnecessary and the costs
occasioned by the defence could have be avoided if the prosecution took the same view of the magistrate on the medical reports submitted
and accepted the offer by the defence to dispose the matter without a trial. 24.  For the above reasons, I disagree with the respondent who submitted that there was clear evidence before the magistrate for her
to conclude that the appellant had in fact brought suspicion upon herself.   25.  Accordingly, I will allow this appeal to award costs of the trial to the appellant to be taxed, and I also award the appellant her

Further, the disciplinary orders under s 30 of the SWRO would be nugatory unless made against a registered social worker.  Hence,
even if the Board has disciplinary jurisdiction over the 1st Interested Party, it does not have any power to make disciplinary order against her. 51.  Finally, as the complaints are trivial in nature, there is minimal public interest in re-investigating the complaints or imposing
any disciplinary orders on the 1st Interested Party.  Hence, even if there is any merit in the grounds of challenge, which I do not accept it to be the case, the court
should not grant the relief as sought by the Applicants. 52.  For the above reasons, I dismiss the Applicant’s application for judicial review.  I also make a costs order nisi that the costs of this application be paid by the Applicant to the Respondent and the 1st Interested Party, which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Judgment.",(David Lok)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/839.html,"Ms Denise Souza, instructed by Chan & Cheng, for the Respondent",denise souza,monica chow,Ellen Au & Co,Chan & Cheng,defendant,0.0

directions. 27.  I rule, in this regard, I am in favour of Mr D’Souza[‘s submission on costs].  Albeit [I was] persuaded that this amendment
should be allowed to enable just resolution of the dispute in the parties, it is clear in the case laws that an explanation by the
amending party is called for.  And in this present application, that was clearly lacking.  And it was really in a delicate balancing
exercise that I ultimately concluded leave should be given. I agree with Mr D’Souza that this is a case that the court would not
fault a litigant in the position of the plaintiff to say that they should have consented [to the application]. The plaintiff’s
contest against it, in my view, therefore, is reasonable.  So I would make the costs of and occasioned by both defendants’ summonses
dated October 2017, with certificate for counsel, be to the plaintiff, save that the costs of today’s hearing be costs in the cause,

A similar decision was given in Secretary for Security v Sakthevel Prabakar [2003] HKCFA 37;  (2003) 6 HKCFAR 397.  The Appeal Committee of the Court of Final Appeal held that even in the field of public law, the fact that an appeal would be academic
as between the parties was a strong factor against granting leave to appeal, but it was not an absolute bar.  The Committee stated
that granting of appeal could be appropriate if there was a sufficiently great public interest to be served by having a question
of public law decided by the Court of Final Appeal.[3] 7.  The final case on which Mr McCoy relies is a decision of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in R v Gordon – Smith [2008] NZSC 56;  [2009] 1 NZLR 721, where it was held that mootness was not a matter that deprived accorded jurisdiction to hear an appeal, but like the other cases
to which I have referred, emphasising that there were important reasons for caution in exercising discretion to hear an appeal when
there were no live issues between the parties.  These included the importance of the adversary system, the need for economy and the
use of court resources and the proper role of the courts.[4]  The Court analysed these reasons, emphasising that a cautious approach should be taken to leave applications where there are no

pay the Parents’ costs of and occasioned by the Time Summons (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if not agreed on
High Court scale and party-and-party basis, and the Parents’ own costs be taxed in accordance with Legal Aid Regulations. 125.

I should mention there was a question, which I confess was first raised by me, as to whether s 42 of the High Court Ordinance (Cap 4), which empowers the court to make orders for discovery by third parties, applies in relation to the removal application at
all because under the section the power is conferred on the court “[o]n the application … of a party to any proceedings in which
a claim is made”.  It was not clear to me what kind of “claim” was envisaged and whether the removal application qualifies
as proceedings “in which a claim is made”. 27.  Prior to the Civil Justice Reform in 2009, s 42 was confined to “proceedings in which a claim in respect of personal injuries to a person or in respect of a person’s death is made” (italics added).  As a result of the recommendation in the reform to make non‑party discovery applicable to “all types
of cases (and not merely to personal injury and death claims)”[7], the words italicised in the quotation above were removed.  The section was therefore not enacted with a view to distinguishing between
proceedings in which a claim is made and proceedings in which no claim is made.  Rather, it was amended with the object of extending
its scope from proceedings in which claims for damages for personal injury and death are made to all types of proceedings.  With
this object in mind I think there is no reason not to attach a wide meaning to the word “claim” which ought to encompass any
case in which relief is sought from the court. 28.  For these reasons both summonses for discovery are dismissed, with costs on a nisi basis.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/939.html,"Mr Bernard Man SC and Mr. Justin Ho, instructed by Anthony Siu & Co,

WRIGHT SALLY JANE v. SUSAN COOK [2018] HKCFI 953; HCAP 26/2012 (30 April 2018),"Mr Enzo W H Chow, instructed by Jackson Ho & Co, for the defendant","19.  Where the proceedings in question should never have been brought or defended but the party nevertheless unreasonably and unjustifiably
persisted, he may well be visited with indemnity costs.  See Huge Dragon Corp Ltd v Lung Mun Oasis (IO) [2014] HKCA 216; [2014] 3 HKLRD 286, per Jeremy Poon J (as he then was) at [13] and the cases cited therein.  This is such a case.  It would be apparent from the Judgment
that I consider Sally’s denial of Susan’s claim to the Estate (which should be understood to be a claim to share in the administration
and distribution of the Estate after Susan’s indication of acceptance of Sally’s joint claim in the Offer) to be utterly devoid
of merits and should not have been persisted in. 20.  For the sake of completeness, my attention has also been drawn to Sally’s repeated refusals to attempt mediation in 2013 and 2016
on the apparent ground that the parties resided in different jurisdictions (Sally in United Kingdom and Susan in Australia).  Given
the steadfastly hostile attitude displayed by Sally towards Susan and her counterclaim, I seriously doubt whether mediation, even
if attempted, would have been fruitful.  More importantly, I do not see this as a point separate from Sally’s denial of Susan’s
counterclaim on unmeritorious grounds. 21.

Ms Law’s basis for suggesting that further financial information should be required demonstrating the current financial state
of the Company was that the onus was upon it to demonstrate its solvency and justify the application.  I accept that as a very general
statement, that would appear to be correct.  However, as I have sought to emphasise in Emagist [6]and on other occasions, applications for validation of expenses incurred in the normal course of business by a company, which the
petitioner itself says is solvent and acknowledges has an ongoing business, need to be considered in a practical manner.  If the
petitioner itself has in its petition acknowledged that a company is solvent and carrying on a business, one would not expect the
evidence that the company files to support a validation order to be particularly extensive as its financial state, or its general
financial state, should not be contentious.  It is only if the petitioner has particular concerns that it can substantiate about
the possible adverse impact on its economic interest in the company that the court should, in practice, be concerned to look in any
detail at its financial position.  The application is not an opportunity for the petitioner to obtain financial information not otherwise
available to it, or an opportunity to criticise or query the current management’s business decisions.  I would expect it only to
be in unusual cases for validation order applications arising from just and equitable winding‑up petitions issued by shareholders
to be contentious.  If both parties are being sensible, it should be possible for them to agree the terms of the validation order
which, it is now common practice, will contain a term requiring a schedule of payments to be provided on a monthly basis to the petitioner. 6.  I will make a validation order in the terms discussed with counsel which I will append to these reasons.  7.  I will make an order that the 1st respondent’s costs of the application are paid out of the assets of the Company.  Mr Maurellet SC sought no other costs order.
 Ms Law sought an order that the petitioners’ costs of the application be paid by the 1st respondent.  Although the application came on at short notice, it still seems to me that the petitioners should have been able to
have agreed an order with the 1st respondent as it is the petitioners’ principal position that no order should be made today.  I will, therefore, deal with costs
as Mr Maurellet SC proposes and make no costs order as between the 1st respondent and the petitioners.",Date of Decision: 30 April 2018(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1041.html,"Ms Jacqueline Law, instructed by Stephenson Harwood, for the 1st and 2nd petitioners",jacqueline law,jose maurellet sc,"Rowland Chow, Chan & Co",Stephenson Harwood,unknown,

 defendant","78.  For the reasons given, I am satisfied that Haitong has a good arguable case that its claim falls within the two gateways and discretion
should be exercised in favour of service out. There was no material non-disclosure as alleged and ADS fails to prove that the service
in Abu Dhabi is contrary to UAE law. Thus, I find no merit in the application of ADS and the Summons falls to be dismissed. 79.  There is no reason why costs should not follow the event. The complicity of this matter and the quantum at stake amply justify engagement
of two counsel. I make an order nisi that costs of and occasioned by the Summons be borne by ADS with certificate for two counsel, to be taxed if not agreed. 80.

HKSAR v. BUTT MUHAMMAD ATEEQ [2018] HKCFI 1258; HCMA 13/2018 (14 May 2018),The Appellant appeared in person,"6.  The final paragraph of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings consists of a single sentence which reads “Court finds the prosecution
has proved their case beyond all reasonable doubts and the defendant is convicted.”  Why the Magistrate so found appears in the
last two sentences of the penultimate paragraph of the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings.  Those two sentences read: “Although
I have doubt regarding the missing tools and have excluded the verbal admission, I accept [PC 5018’s] evidence that he actually
found P1 in a wallet (P4) defendant was carrying.  I find the defendant has no lawful authority or reasonable excuse to have P1 in
his possession.” 7.  Albeit on the papers, appeals of this kind from the Magistrates’Court to the High Court are by way of rehearing.  While due weight
is to be attached to a magistrate’s advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses,the appellate judge will not affirm a conviction
if not satisfied that it is safe.  The Magistrate tried the case conscientiously of course, but has offered noexplanation why PC
5018’s evidence that he found P1 on the Appellant can be safely relied upon even though his evidence that the Appellant made a
verbal admission to him cannot be safely relied upon.  Neither of those twopieces of evidence is materially more susceptible to honest
mistake than the other.  In fairness to PC 5018, it should be stressed that neither anything said by the Magistrate nor anything
said by me involves finding that he had not been honest.  But the Magistrate not having felt it safe to rely upon PC 5018’s evidence
that the Appellant had made an oral admission to him, I am not satisfied that the reliance which the Magistrate placed on PC 5018’sevidence
of finding P1 on the Appellant is safe.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the conviction is safe. 8.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed.",Date of Judgment: 14 May 2018(V Bokhary),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1258.html,"Mr Charles Lee, SPP (Ag) of the Department of Justice, for the Respondent",charles lee,in person,,,plaintiff,1.0

I wish to make an observation on the procedure for leave application in a matter of the present type. 84.  There was in this case an inter parte leave application which was heard in January 2017.  Following the judgment where DHCJ Lee
gave leave to appeal, there was an application by Bauer for leave to appeal against that judgment.  That resulted in another hearing
on 16 May 2017 and a Ruling by the learned Deputy Judge dated 26 May 2017.  Dissatisfied with the Ruling, Bauer then sought leave
from the Court of Appeal.  That application was heard and dismissed on 24 August 2017 with Reasons for Judgment and Decision on Costs
given on 4 September 2017.  85.  Speaking for myself, I would have found it quite difficult to determine the application for leave to appeal against Award (1) without
getting into much details and a great deal of assistance by counsel on both sides.  I believe that there is scope for a roll-up hearing
for the leave application, which is sometimes adopted in judicial review proceedings, in an usually difficult case.  The decision
whether to adopt such a procedure is of course that of the judge seized of the matter.  This procedure has the attractions of speed
and saving of costs.  It will be in line with the underlying objectives embodied in O1A, r 1.",(Anthony Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1057.html,"Mr Peter Clayton SC, instructed by Pinsent Masons, for the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs

I have doubts in the existence of the First Oral Agreement with which the Second Oral Agreement was related.  Furthermore, another
reason which prevented me from drawing the inference that the Second Oral Agreement is inherently probable is my reservation about
Suen’s credibility.  I have mentioned about his dishonesty in: 136.  Kong Cheong, Ko Kan or Kuang, but not the Plaintiff, may havea good claim against Suen or Wui San for the balance of compensation
in the sum of $90 million payable upon execution of the certificate of transfer of the Land.  However, that is not what this action
is about.  This action is not about the rights or wrongs of those parties in the background transactions, but about the rights and
obligations of the Plaintiff and Suen or of Suen and Ko Kan under their alleged agreements made to settle the disputes relating to
those background transactions.  The core issue in the original action is whether the Plaintiff and Suen had entered into the Verbal
Agreement to procureKong Cheong to execute the certificate of transfer for an intermediary fee of $95 million; or in the counterclaim
whether Suen and Ko Kan had entered into the First and Second Oral Agreements to procure Kong Cheong to delivervacant possession
of the Land and to clear all its encumbrances for a fee of $105 million.  The Plaintiff bears the burden of proof in the original
action; while Suen and Wui San bear the burden of proof in the counterclaim.  137.  In the ultimate analysis, I find that all the witnesses of the parties were incredible and not telling the whole truth.  I reluctantly
come to the conclusion that the parties have failed to discharge their respective burden of proof.  Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s
claim in the original action and the defendants’ claim in the counterclaim are dismissed.

in Hebei, come close to justifying the setting aside of the Enforcement Order on the public policy ground. 30.  For completeness sake, I should also mention the question of leave to extend time.  In the Setting Aside Summons, Capxon seeks “leave
to extend the time within which the application for the order under this Summons should be made until the date hereof should this Honourable Court consider that such application is made out of time” (emphasis added).  Capxon’s primary contention is that as the service of the Enforcement Order was ineffective, the time for
it to apply to have it set aside has not started to run.  I do not intend to go into the issue of service unnecessarilyand on such
contingency basis.  I will only say this.  If extension of timeis required, I will refuse to grant any.  I have considered the overall
justice of the case.  I avoid the application of any rigid mechanistic approach.  On the basis of my conclusion expressed above on
the lack of any basis to challenge the Enforcement Order, it would have been futile for me to grant any extension. 31.  At the end of the hearing on 2 May 2018, I dismissed the Setting Aside Summons with costs to Paloma on an indemnity basis.  I promised

                   Without prejudice to subsection (2), this Part applies in respect of births after (but not before)
the commencement of this Part [ie. 14 April 1978], and in respect of any such birth it replaces any law in force before such commencement whereby a person could be liable to a child
in respect of disabilities with which it might be born; but in section 22B(3) the expression liable in tort( 承擔侵權責任 ) does not include any reference to liability by virtue of this Part, or to liability by virtue of any such law.
                
            



Section 4(5):



                This Act applies in respect of births after (but not before) its passing, and in respect of any such birth it replaces
any law in force before its passing, whereby a person could be liable to a child in respect of disabilities with which it might be
born; but in section 1(3) of this Act the expression “liable in tort” does not include any reference to liability by virtue of
this Act, or to liability by virtue of any such law.Section 22B:



                
                    (1)       If a child is born disabled as the result of such an occurrence before its birth
as is mentioned in subsection (2) and a person (other than the child’s own mother) is under this section answerable to the child
in respect of the occurrence, the child’s disabilities are to be regarded as damage resulting from the wrongful act of that person
and actionable accordingly at the suit of the child.

                   (2)       An occurrence to which this section applies is
one which – (a) affected either parent of the child in his or her ability to have a normal, healthy child; or (b) affected the
mother during her pregnancy, or affected her or the child in the course of its birth, so that the child is born with disabilities
which would not otherwise have been present.

                    (3)       Subject to subsections (4) and (7), a person (hereafter
referred to as the defendant) is answerable to the child if he was liable in tort to the parent or would, if sued in due time, have been so; and it is no answer
that there could not have been such liability because the parent suffered no actionable injury, if there was a breach of legal duty
which, accompanied by injury, would have given rise to liability.

                    (4)       In the case of an occurrence preceding
the time of conception, the defendant is not answerable to the child if at that time either or both of the parents knew the risk
of their child being born disabled (that is to say, the particular risk created by the occurrence); but should it be the child’s
father who is the defendant, this subsection does not apply if he knew of the risk and the mother did not.

                    (5)
      The defendant is not answerable to the child, for anything he did or omitted to do when responsible in a professional capacity
for treating or advising the parent, if he took reasonable care having due regard to then received professional opinion applicable
to the particular class of case; but this does not mean that he is answerable only because he departed from received opinion.

 
                  (6)       Liability to the child under this section may be treated as having been excluded or limited by contract
made with the parent affected, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions as liability in the parent’s own case; and
a contract term which could have been set up by the defendant in an action by the parent, so as to exclude or limit his liability
to him or her, operates in the defendant’s favour to the same, but no greater, extent in an action under this section by the child.

                    (7)       If in the child’s action under this section it is shown that the parent affected share the responsibility
for the child being born disabled, the damages are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard
to the extent of the parent’s responsibility.
               
            



Section 1:



                
                    (1)       If a child is born disabled as the result of such an occurrence before its birth
as is mentioned in subsection (2) below, and a person (other than the child’s own mother) is under this section answerable to the
child in respect of the occurrence, the child’s disabilities are to be regarded as damage resulting from the wrongful act of that
person and actionable accordingly at the suit of the child.

                    (2)       An occurrence to which this section applies
is one which – (a) affected either parent of the child in his or her ability to have a normal, healthy child; or (b) affected the
 mother during her pregnancy, or affected her or the child in the course of its birth, so that the child is born with disabilities
which would not otherwise have been present.

                    (3)       Subject to the following subsections, a person (hereafter
referred to as “the defendant”) is answerable to the child if he was liable in tort to the parent or would, if sued in due time,
have been so; and it is no answer that there could not have been such liability because the parent suffered no actionable injury,
if there was a breach of legal duty which, accompanies by injury, would have given rise to the liability.

                   (4)
      In the case of an occurrence preceding the time of conception, the defendant is not answerable to the child if at that time
either or both of the parents knew the risk of their child being born disabled (that is to say, the particular risk created by the
occurrence); but should it be the child’s father who is the defendant, this subsection does not apply if he knew of the risk and
the mother did not.

                    (5)       The defendant is not answerable to the child, for anything he did or omitted to
do when responsible in a professional capacity for treating or advising the parent, if he took reasonable care having due regard
to then received professional opinion applicable to the particular class of case; but this does not mean that he is answerable only
because he departed from received opinion.

                   (6)       Liability to the child under this section may be treated
as having been excluded or limited by contract made with the parent affected, to the same extent and subject to the same restrictions
as liability in the parent’s own case; and a contract term which could have been set up by the defendant in an action by the parent,
so as to exclude or limit his liability to him or her, operates in the defendant’s favour to the same, but no greater, extent in
an action under this section by the child.

                   (7)       If in the child’s action under this section it is shown
that the parent affected shared the responsibility for the child being born disabled, the damages are to be reduced to such extent
as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the extent of the parent’s responsibility.","Section 22C:



                Liability to a child under section 22B is to be regarded – (a) as respects all its incidents and any matters
arising or to arise out of it; and (b) subject to any contrary context or intention, for the purpose of construing references in
enactments and documents to personal or bodily injuries and cognate matters, as liability for personal injuries sustained by the
child immediately after its birth.
            



Section 4(3):


                Liability to a child under section 1 or 2 of this Act is to be regarded – (a) as respects all its incidents and
any matters arising or to arise out of it; and (b) subject to any contrary context or intention, for the purpose of construing references

It follows that Tasty is liable to pay to Top Catering a net sum of: 61.  I therefore order that Tasty shall pay the sum of $480,862.20 to Top Catering with interest at 1% over the prevailing prime lending
rate of HSBC from the date of writ until the date of this judgment, and therefore at the judgment rate until payment. 62.  As to costs, Top Catering is, overall speaking, the successful party because Tasty is liable to pay a net sum to it.  Top Catering
succeeds on most of its claims whereas Tasty fails on most of its counterclaims (save those which Top Catering has already admitted).
 In the circumstances, Tasty should pay the costs of this action (including both Top Catering’s claims and Tasty’s counterclaims)
to Top Catering.  However, the amount that Top Catering can recover from Tasty is substantially less than the amount of its primary
claim; and it has failed on some items.  Adopting a broad-brush approach, I shall only allow Top Catering to recover 90% of the costs
that it has incurred in this action.  I shall make a costs order nisi that Tasty shall pay 90% of Top Catering’s costs in this action to be taxed if not agreed. If any party intends to apply to vary

Mr Mok submitted that given the arbitral tribunal had indicated that the award would be handed down on 24 June 2018, there was no
urgency for the receivership to be discharged pending the publication of the award and no prejudice for the BDO Receivers to remain
in place.  I was not persuaded by this argument.  First, the date of publication of the award had been extended before, and one did
not know that it would not be extended again.  Secondly, as Mr Chan SC submitted for ACC, the true question is whether there was
any further present need for the receivership to continue.  If not, the fact that it would in any event come to an end in due course
was not a reason against immediate discharge.  To say that there would be no harm for the BDO Receivers to continue was to put the
cart before the horse.  Thirdly, the arbitration was not for enforcement of the security such as the sale of pledged shares and the
application of the proceeds for repayment of the loans.  In the arbitration request as finally varied on 21 September 2017, Chen
HQ asked the arbitral tribunal: 31.  Mr Mok also submitted there had been delay on the part of the defendants in taking out the present application.  While it is true
that some of the developments relied upon had emerged some time ago, judgment in the Trust Actions was only given on 31 January 2018,
as a result of which the purchase of shares by Chen HQ could no longer be said to be “conditional” even on his original case.
 Further, Chen HQ’s case that he had irrevocably purchased the employee-plaintiffs’ interests in CSI did not emerge publicly
until the joinder application in the Trust Actions which was heard only on 10 November 2017.  Even if there was delay, there was
no suggestion of any prejudice caused to Chen HQ and I do not consider it should be a bar to relief. 32.

As set out by DHCJ Yee in Toyota Tsucho(HK) Corporation Limited and Chimei Innolus Corporation and anor HCA 1173/2011, (unreported) 25.02.15 Decision, the court has to embark on a balancing exercise having particular regard to the reason
for lateness (if any), the relevance and necessity of the new evidence to be adduced and any prejudice that the other side would
suffer if such new evidence is to be allowed to be included, and all the matters have to be considered in light of the specific circumstances
of the case. 36.  In my view, as the trial was set down for 10 days, there should be sufficient time for D to take instructions on the emails. I accept
that there would be prejudice to D due to the lateness but there was no sufficient evidence that there needed to be an adjournment
of the trial or there would be any serious disruption to the trial.  As I have said, the emails were contemporaneous documents and

The Company was given a 14-day extension of time to serve an affirmation in opposition on 16 May 2018.  The affirmation that has
been filed on behalf of the Company by Mr Zhang Lei, in my view, clearly does not explain why at least a sum of US$12,905,000 is
not payable.  It does not seem to me that the payment of at least that sum is an issue in dispute in the arbitration.  5.  That being the case, there is no evidence before the court which demonstrate a bona fide defence on substantial grounds to the claim for that sum and I can see no justification for requiring the arbitration to be completed
before allowing the petitioners to petition to wind up the Company for the significant debt which, on the basis of the evidence before
me, is indisputably payable to them. 6.  I will therefore make the

of the concerns raised, Liu fairly agreed to step down, and Yeo had agreed to step in as a Liquidator with his colleague Chan as
the other Liquidator. 61.  As explained above, the court may on cause shown make an order for removal of a liquidator and appoint another one as consequential
relief. But there must be proper cause shown and not “if the court shall think fit”.[22] Here, both the Registrar and OR adopted a neutral stance, and papers had been filed to show Yeo’s and Chan’s fitness and experience

I am not inclined to compartmentalise things into the two stageswhich Mr Ah-weng has contended for.  That approach is too refined
for my taste.  The cogency or otherwise of the reasons for a party wanting to rely on another expert is simply one of the factors—‌admittedly
a very important one‌—‌to be taken into account in the balancing exercise.  But that is not something which I need to decide
because, for the reasons I have already given, the reasons for questioning the basis on which Mr Leung excluded the possibility that
the difference between Madam Chan’s known signatures and the signature on the document in question was attributable to different
authorship rather than the state of her health are far from fanciful.  And when it comes to the balancing exercise, I have no doubt
that the court will beassisted by knowing the extent to which Mr Leung and Mr Radley continue todisagree about whether it is possible
to attribute those differences to different authorship—not least because by then the court should be satisfied that Mr Leung has
indeed considered the documents which relate to Madam Chan’s medical condition. 32.  For these reasons, I adjourn Mr Ho’s application for leave to rely on Mr Radley’s report at the trial of the action.  In case
Mr Leung has not been provided with the documents relating to Madam Chan’s medical condition, I order that he be provided with
them within 14 days of this judgment, to the extent that he has not been provided with them before.  I order that Mr Leung and Mr
Radley discuss their respective opinions within 28 days thereafter, whether in person or by video link or conference call.  I order
that within 21 days thereafter they jointly prepare a report setting out the issues on which they agree and the issues on which they
disagree.  I give the parties liberty to restore the summons to which Mr Ho’s application relates following the receipt of that
joint report. 33.  My current thinking is that it would be premature to make any order for costs.  Accordingly, the order nisi 
	I make as to costs is that the costs of this application be reserved to the 
	judge on the restoration of the summons, with liberty
to either party to 
	apply for an appropriate order for costs in the event of the summons not 
	being restored.",Date of Judgment: 7 June 2018(Sir Brian Keith),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1265.html,"Ms Juliana Chow and Mr Michael Kung, instructed by Lam & Co, for the plaintiff",michael kung,jonathan ah-weng,Tso Au Yim & Yeung,Lam & Co,unknown,

Though the quantification of damages does not arise, I might state for the sake of completeness that, had I found against the defendant,
I would have awarded the sum of $4,000,000.  I would have done so on Mr Man’s acceptance that the defendant would have been permitted
to have traded in some of the trades he made without breach of any duty owed, that the defendant would likely have also engaged in
other permitted trades (in place of those which, for this purpose, are assumed to have been in breach of duty) and that they would
have been affected by the significant market downturn which was shown in evidence by a chart covering the period June to December
2011.  I think it would also be necessary to give credit for the profit taken on trades which were (on this hypothesis) a breach
of duty, and the ex gratia payment.  Doing the best I can with all this material, I think the sum of $4 million would have been appropriate as the damages figure. 175.  As to costs, I make a costs order nisi that the costs follow the event, meaning the defendant will be entitled to his costs of the action (save such time as was spent in
the failed amendment application at trial).  The costs order will become absolute if neither party applies to vary it within 14 days.
 176.  Any application to vary can be made by letter and will be dealt with on paper.  If any application to vary is made, it shall include
the argument for the specified variation, and the other party shall have 14 days to respond, followed by 7 days for any reply.","Date of Judgment:

In my view, what transpired between Lau and D2 at the January meeting, whether an agreement was reached and its terms as well as
what transpired between D2 and Cecilia Leung in July 2016 would be critical in determining the outcome of the dispute between the

scepticism, the circumstances of the present case are unusual. 39.  Given the available evidence which is far from complete and satisfactory, I am not persuaded that there is no serious issue to be
tried.  In my view, this is hardly a clear case that would warrant summary judgment given the differing versions of what transpired
at the January meeting. It is to be noted that when this summons was taken out on 25 April 2017, the plaintiff had full notice of

In the present case, the Plaintiff is not making any claim to the personal estate of a deceased person (ie Mr Au) or to any share
or interest in such estate.  His claims, as earlier mentioned, are for (i) a revocation of the Grant, (ii) an order appointing him
as administrator of the estate of Mr Au, and (iii) an order requiring the Defendant to render a just and true account in respect
of his administration of the estate of Mr Au.  These claims are not, in my view, subject to Section 20(1) (see Re Loftus, Deceased [2006] EWCA Civ 1124;  [2007] 1 WLR 591, at paragraphs 30 and 32 per Chadwick LJ). 18.  It is true that if the Plaintiff’s claim as the adopted son of Mr Au is established, he would be a beneficiary of the estate of
Mr Au and thus entitled to a share or interest in the estate under the Intestates’ Estates Ordinance, Cap 73.  However, as mentioned above, the Plaintiff is not making a claim for any share or interest in the estate of Mr Au in this
action.  In any event, even if the Plaintiff should make such claim, it would be a claim to recover from the Defendant (as administrator)
trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the Defendant falling under Section 20(1)(b) and therefore not caught
by the limitation period prescribed by Section 21. 19.  For the above reasons, I consider that the proposed limitation defence is misconceived.  It follows that the application to amend
is refused.

 Maintenance of his father ought to be a shared burden amongst himself and his two sisters.  This is not unreasonable, quite irrespective
of whether any inference may be drawn from the trustees’ suggestion that the sisters have claimed parents’ dependency allowance
for taxation purpose (which the bankrupt indeed disputed).  The trustees mentioned the possibility of application for old age living
allowance, but that would really be subject to test of eligibility.  So I would say no more about its possible relevance in the balancing
exercise. 8.  The bankrupt has failed to show, either by evidence or his representation to the court, that the trustees have erred or failed to

under Section 66 of the Legislative Council Ordinance, Cap 542, be dispensed with. 34.  On the question of costs, Mr Marwah fairly accepts that the Returning Officer should have the costs of these applications.  I order
the Petitioner to pay the Returning Officer’s costs of and occasioned by the three summonses, including the costs of the hearing
on 6 June 2018, to be taxed if not agreed. 35.  In so far as the Petitioner’s own costs are concerned, I am not minded to allow legal aid taxation, because those costs have been
incurred as a result of what I regard to be elementary mistakes on the part of the Petitioner’s legal adviser(s) who have acted
well below the standard that could reasonably be expected of reasonably competent lawyers.  In this regard, in addition to the mistake
in using the incorrect form of application originally, there was a failure to apply for directions promptly on 17 May 2018 even though
they had been alerted by the court of the mistake, and also a failure to apply for an extension of time to issue the Inter Partes
Directions Summons until the hearing on 6 June 2018 notwithstanding the Department of Justice’s letters dated 24 and 29 May 2018

 However, in case there should be some other relevant matters which I am not aware of or which I ought to have taken into account

it is difficult to think that she had gone back on that statement so as consciously to reverse the burden of proof.  But to say (as
the Magistrate said in paragraph 85 of her Statement of Findings) that she “[did] not accept as the truth that the Defendant had
been framed up” is cause for real concern that she might have lost sight of the question which the burden and standard of proof
operated to pose in regard to whether the Appellant had been framed.  That question was not merely whether the Magistrate accepted
that the Appellant had been framed.  It extended to whether she thought that he might have been framed.  I do not think that the
Magistrate’s statement that she “[did] not accept as the truth that the Defendant had been framed up” can be safely dismissed
as a linguistic slip.  All things considered, I do not regard these convictions as safe. 12.  The appeal is therefore allowed so as to quash these convictions.  Before deciding whether to order that the Appellant be acquitted

at the party threw a glassat another person at the party.  The glass shattered causing three lacerations to the victim’s face,
requiring nine stitches.  The relevant passage in Deputy Judge To’s judgment is one in which he said this: 12.  Despite the arguments ably advanced on the Appellant’s behalf, I find no proper basis on which to say that the Magistrate was
not justified in passing an immediate custodial sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment.  I do not consider the sentence manifestly

paid up ie HK$9,999. I do not think such an estimate can be faulted even though it has been said that the practice of the bankruptcy
court not to inquire into the correctness of the petitioning creditor’s estimate of the value of a security should not be applied
inflexibly: see Re Choi Chi Kwun [2000] 3 HKC503; Re Choi Wing Cheong (unrep, HCB 16148/2003, 22 December 2004).  7.  The Debtor had no defence to the Petition and all he could say at the hearing was that because the accounts had only been made up
to 2014, he had to ask the accountants to provide updated figures on the financial condition of the company.  That is obviously not
a defence to the Petition; nor does it provide any reason why a bankruptcy order should not be made given that the petitioner has
complied with the requirements of section 6B(1)(b) in stating an estimated value of the security and making clear that the Petition
is not made in respect of the secured part of the debt. 8.  For these reasons, I made the usual bankruptcy order with costs.","EX-PARTE:

The parties have in addition drawn attention to certain separate matters but I think they are not sufficiently relevant to affect
the outcome on costs.  For example, Ms Chow submitted that the 2nd Respondent brought contempt proceedings against Mr Kennedy for disclosing the transcripts of her private examination without leave
of the court.  These are separate proceedings the costs of which have been separately dealt with.  They were simply part of the highly
acrimonious battles between the parties. I do not see that the 2nd Respondent’s ultimate failure (having won in the Court of Appeal) in the contempt proceedings should affect the costs position in
the present proceedings. 25.  For the 2nd Respondent’s part, Mr Barlow referred to certain evidence and alleged that the Applicant had tried to use the criminal proceedings
against the 2nd Respondent to force or induce her to settle the misfeasance claim.  As I stated in my reasons for ruling handed down on 27 October
2016, the Applicant had not had an opportunity of responding to or refuting this allegation.  No finding has been made against him
in this respect.  It would not be right for present purposes to proceed on the basis that there was such wrongdoing on his part. 26.  It is not easy to put the above considerations individually into numerical terms and I do not think it is necessary to put a “value”
on each factor.  In exercising its discretion the court has to take a broad brush rather than an accountant’s pen.  Having regard
to all the circumstances, the order of costs I make is as follows:","KAM SHING

would then have been an objective consideration of whether the only reasonable inference to draw from that description was that all
the elements of indecent assault were duly proved.  But the Magistrate did not confine himself to such an approach.  Complaint is
made on the Appellant’s behalf against the passage in the Magistrate’s Statement of Findings in which he said as follows: 9.  Even an able and experienced Magistrate might occasionally fall into error.  It is submitted on the Appellant’s behalf that the
Magistrate had relied on, and had erred in law in relying on, Alice’s subjective belief that the contact between the Appellant
and her was intentional rather than accidental and was indecent rather than harmless.  From what the Magistrate said, the inescapable
conclusion is that he did indeed, to at least a material extent even if not exclusively, rely on that subjective belief in finding
that such contact was intentional rather accidental and was indecent rather than harmless. For that reason, and even without reference
to the other grounds of appeal, I am of the view that the conviction should be quashed on the basis of an error of law made in arriving
at it and also on the basis that it is neither safe nor satisfactory. 10.

there any proposals made by the Father until this Court’s enquiry during the hearing.  The Father disclosed that he had surrendered
the lease on the house in Esher and had rented a 2 bedroom fully furnished home in Maidstone in Kent, near his mother which he proposed
to vacate to allow the Mother and EMB to reside therein.  The Father had also put forward other proposals.  There was apparently
a return date in the English Court on 10 August 2018. 83.  As the Father’s proposals were put forward at a late stage, I am not sure what the Mother’s position would be.  Thus, I would

such order is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs under Order 20 rule 8 (1A) of

reserved by Master M. Wong, I take it that the adjournment was caused by the late issuance of the striking out application by the
5th defendant.  He should therefore be responsible for the wasted costs of the plaintiffs.  Regarding other defendants who were also

The entitlement to recover any profit made by P from the investment made by CPCB-CF under the Xinrui investment agreement of 24
August 2007 conferred by the Court’s judgment is an entitlement conferred on D1 alone. That said, D2 will be well aware of the
contents of P’s affirmation and it is inevitable that D2 will become privy to further information and documents provided by P pursuant
to the order that I make herein. I have therefore concluded that both Defendants should be required to provide an express written
undertaking that any further information provided by P pursuant to the said order will be kept confidential save for its use in these
proceedings, which use shall be the sole use to which the information will be put. 9.  In my judgment, given P’s untruthful account of when he began to discuss a possible investment in Xinrui and the relative scarcity
of the discovery he provided for the trial, D1 is entitled to an order that goes wider than might have been conventionally appropriate
in setting the modalities for an account of secret profits to be given by a fiduciary. It is also the case that, since P did not
himself provide the alleged US$ 8million invested in Xinrui, the absence of any profit for CPCB-CF on the US$ 8 million investment
does not necessarily mean that P personally did not benefit financially in one way or another from the investment. 10.

 Putative Respondent","23.  Fourth, there is no useful purpose to be served by granting the Applicant leave to apply for judicial review of the Decision, because
the District Court Action has come to an end.  There is no question of the Director now granting legal aid to the Applicant to pursue
an action which has already been struck out.  The fact that the Applicant has a pending application for leave to appeal against the
decision of H H Judge Andrew Li dated 24 April 2018 is irrelevant, because neither an appeal nor an application for leave to appeal
operates as a stay of the relevant decision. 24.  For the foregoing reasons, the application for leave to apply for judicial review, and the application for an extension of time
to apply for leave, are dismissed. 25.  On the question of costs, the two applications are, in my view, completely unmeritorious.  Further, the Applicant failed to set
out all the relevant background facts in his affirmation filed in support of the leave application, which led to the court directing
the Director to file evidence and to attend the hearing to resist the application.  Also, the Director’s participation at the oral
hearing has been of substantial assistance to the court in reaching its decision on whether to grant leave to apply for judicial
review in the instant case.  In all the circumstances, I consider that the Applicant should bear the Director’s costs in this matter,

AFFLUENT CONSTRUCTION CO LTD T/A PO LAM CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CO v. YU CHEUNG YIN [2018] HKCFI 1452; HCA 329/2016 (27 June 2018),"Mr Leo Wong, instructed by Y S Lau & Partners, for the defendant","113.  A finding that the contractor was 46 days ahead in a 120 working days’ contract may appear impossible.  This result was reached
primarily because of the plaintiff’s foresight and efforts in mitigating the defendant’s mistake.  The plaintiff used extra strong
Type II sheet piles atextra costs in anticipation that approval for the use of this sheet piles would be given and carried on work
at its own risk before the suspension was ordered.  If approval were not given, the plaintiff would suffer double loss.  The use
of Type II sheet piles was approved.  The plaintiff’s foresight turned out to be correct and the extra costs well spent.  By assuming
the risk, the plaintiff gained time before suspension was ordered.  It deserves the credit for its foresight and assumption of risk.
 Even if I were to count the delay from 15 November 2012 instead of from 18 October 2012 (which will result in a reduction of 19
working days)[14], the plaintiff would still be comfortably within time by being 27 days ahead. Another reason was because the defendant took 26 days
to come up with a decision on the installation of the starter bars.  Accordingly, the defendant’s counterclaim must be dismissed. 114.  For the above reasons, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff on its claim for outstanding contract sum in the amount of $241,400
and costs of additional works in the amount of $110,250, totaling $351,650 with interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the rate
of one percent over prime rate from the date of issue of the writ in the District Courtuntil the date of judgment and thereafter

status in this action.  I am however not convinced by Clara’s general and vague reference to anticipated difficulties arising from
the long lapse of time, the volume of the materials to go through and the possible needs for the Defendants to obtain documents and
information from third parties such as banks and go to professionals such as accountants for assistance.  Despite the passage of
time, the accounts ordered are of a relatively straightforward nature.  The accounts were ordered back in September 2016.  Despite
their application for leave to appeal out of time and stay of execution, the Defendants should have been prepared to be called upon
to produce the accounts since the last quarter of 2016.  24.  I further make an order nisi that the Defendants should pay Father’s costs of and occasioned by Father’s summons dated 27 April 2018, to be taxed if not agreed

contract itself. Termination and discharge of the underlying agreement does not affect the validity and operation of the arbitration
agreement. There is accordingly no basis to argue that the arbitration agreement between the parties in this case has been terminated,

no longer possible.  In my view, quite apart from the lateness of the application, and the distinct possibility of the trial dates

defendants, and in particular to the estate of the Deceased and D2, which cannot be put right by costs. 12.  In all the circumstances, and having balanced them, I refuse the application. 13.

I would add that it does not seem clear to me that if a petitioner genuinely wants the relief he seeks, but his reasons for doing
so form part of a broader strategy, which the relief if granted will advance, presentation of a petition under section 740 is an impermissible use of the jurisdiction.  The guileless admission of the purpose for presenting the petition in Re Astec[7] perhaps made the issue of principle seem rather simpler to Jonathan Parker J than, with respect, it seems to me to be.  For example,
I ask rhetorically, does it make a difference if Elliott as sophisticated investors anticipate that a desirable consequence of obtaining
the order they seek would probably be the Bank becoming a takeover target, as opposed to Elliott being motivated to some degree in
deciding to issue the Petition by a desire that the Bank becomes a takeover target?  Again asked rhetorically, what if the members
of the board of the relevant members of the Elliott Group, whilst all agreeing to a resolution that the Petition should be presented,
had varying views on why this should be done? 11.  Mr Yu submitted that if I were to find against him I should not deal with the factual and legal arguments advanced before me other
than in general terms as it might unhelpfully influence the way in which the parties prepared their cases if the matter proceeds
to trial.  I agree.  It does not seem to me appropriate to purport to determine any of the issues on a strike-out application, as
in the case of the collateral purpose issue Mr Sussex invited me to do, and I agree with Mr Yu that to produce a detailed reasoned
decision would risk influencing the way in which the parties shaped their cases going forward. 12.

because it is made of fibre cannot hold water. 55.  Accordingly, I find all the grounds of appeal fail. 56.  The Magistrate’s interpretation that the fibre slings used in this case fall within the ambit of regulation 18A(a) is plainly

It also seems to me that at the outset, both the Company and the investor had their own specific interests which they were entitled
to want to ensure were properly represented at the hearing, even if in practice it might well be that a substantial amount of the
argument dealing with the legal issues discussed in my decision would in the first instance be advanced by counsel for the provisional
liquidators.  As Mr Scott SC correctly reminded me the joint and provisional liquidators’ principal interest was to represent the
economic interests of the creditors in the proposed restructuring that Ankang were trying to derail, the board of the Company’s
interest obviously extended further and to the contributories of the Company generally; the investor had an independent commercial
interest in ensuring that the application was properly contested and its interests adequately protected.  6.  The only matter which it seems to me requires much consideration is Ankang’s suggestion that it was not necessary for the Company
to be represented by two counsel, given the representation that the joint and provisional liquidators appointed.  This, of course,
is a matter of judgment, and a judgment that had to be made at the time it was necessary for the Company to determine what representation
was appropriate for the hearing.  It is not a matter that can be assessed with the benefit of hindsight.  It does seem to me that
the issues that were raised by the summons were sufficiently important and sufficiently complicated that it was not unreasonable

The most straightforward way for the Company to deal with this technical issue is to find a friendly creditor to present a winding-up
petition, the board could then resolve to apply to appoint provisional liquidators.  I do not think that that application would run
into the Emmadart problem.  8.  I am satisfied that, subject to the issue that I have discussed, this is a proper case to appoint provisional liquidators.  It also
seems to me that as the board of the Company is presently involved in a restructuring exercise it is probable that any order appointing
provisional liquidators could at its inception legitimately include restructuring powers. Generally, the present practice of the
Company’s Court is that orders appointing provisional liquidators do not initially contain restructuring powers; those are only
introduced after the provisional liquidators have familiarised themselves with the affairs of the Company and if they make an application
to extend their powers. 9.  I will, therefore, adjourn the application.

I would end with making some observations about the listing of proceedings such as the present.  Practice Direction 3.1, Part II,
[5.5] provides that an originating summons to convene a meeting to consider a scheme pursuant to section 673 of the Companies Ordinance, Cap 622, shall be listed on Tuesdays at 10am and the bundles and skeleton shall be filed the preceding Tuesday.  The conventional
practice has been for a solicitor, who has been instructed to proceed with a scheme promptly to contact the Companies Judge’s clerk
to fix dates.  The court will normally try and accommodate a proposed timetable if given sufficient notice and it is common for hearings
to be heard on days other than a Tuesday.  The solicitors should then work to the dates that have been allocated.  48.  I have noticed in recent years an increasing tendency for solicitors not to proceed as I have described, but to leave fixing dates
to well after formulation and drafting of a scheme has commenced and then expect the court to accommodate what is described as an
“urgent’ application.  In the more extreme cases not only are dates sought within a few weeks of the court being approached,
but solicitors request that the dates are fixed in accordance with their counsel’s diary and in apparent ignorance of PD3.1.  The
present case was an example.  When the court informed Dentons that their preferred dates were simply not available, the court received
complaints that if the hearing to convene the meeting did not take place promptly this would be inconsistent with the Australian
practice and expectation; a complaint that looked increasingly lame as the matter proceeded and the Company required substantial
time to address various questions the court had about the structure of the scheme that it became apparent neither Dentons nor the
Company’s legal advisers in Australia had identified nor readily answer. 49.  I would emphasise that the Companies Court expects solicitors to proceed as follows when acting for parties introducing schemes
or capital reductions.  As soon as they are instructed to proceed with a scheme or capital reduction they should approach the Companies
Judge’s clerk to obtain dates, which it is reasonable to expect the company to meet.  Counsel should be instructed who are available
on the allocated dates and the Company should work towards those dates.  The Companies Court should not be expected to fit in with
the convenience of companies and solicitors should make this clear to those instructing them.",IN THE MATTER of the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622)(Jonathan Harris),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1736.html,"Mr William Wong SC and Mr Michael Lok, instructed by

costs of the appeal from the Master to be taxed if not agreed. 11.  It seems to me there is no usual rule in the present kind of case that the receiver should be indemnified as to all costs. Nor is
there a general rule that a fiduciary can litigate unsuccessfully against the beneficiary at the latter’s expense.  Contrary to
my initial impression, the point of principle is not entirely novel, having regard to the authorities referred to in my decision.
 In all the circumstances of this case I fail to see why costs should not follow the event.  Taking into account, however, that none
of the authorities relied upon in paras 28 to 33 and 35 to 38 of my decision nor Order 30 r 5 was cited by counsel or drawn to the
attention of the Receiver earlier by the Association, and the lateness of the Association’s application due to its own internal
problems, I consider that the Association should only have half of its costs.  12.  There will accordingly be an order that the Receiver do pay half of the Association’s costs of the application including the costs
of the argument on costs (without indemnity from the Association’s assets), with a certificate for junior counsel, to be taxed
if not agreed.",Date of Decision on Costs: 3 August 2018(Godfrey Lam),Judge of the Court of First InstanceHigh Court,/2018/1812.html,"Written submissions by Mr Douglas Lam SC and Mr David Chen, instructed by Messrs T.H.

only because of the unique circumstances of the applicant who only enjoyed right of abode in Hong Kong prior to 1997, but had not
been able to acquire right of abode in the HKSAR after 1997 due to his personal circumstances, namely his voluntary departure from
Hong Kong and imprisonment while present in Hong Kong as a result of his criminal convictions.  17.  Fourthly, there has been undue delay in the part of the applicant in circumstances where the relevant parties have been fully vindicated

CHINA REAL ESTATES INVESTMENT HOLDINGS LTD v. GOLD BLESS INTERNATIONAL INVEST LTD [2018] HKCFI 1868; HCCT 46/2017 (8 August 2018),"Mr Patrick Chong, instructed by Howse Williams Bowers, for the third


 
       party (Mr Yang Wang Jian)","9.  Essentially, what Mr Yu is saying is: I want to find out if there was any possible wrongdoing by the director of the Respondent
which can be raised to constitute an arguable defence to the claims made by the Applicant under the agreement which is the subject
matter of the arbitration leading to the Award, which is now being enforced.  That is clearly impermissible fishing, and cannot be
the basis of a discovery order.  To borrow the phrase used in Lady Anne Tennant v Associated Newspapers Group Ltd which was in the context of O 14 proceedings, Mr Yu is only seeking to investigate alleged obscurities in the hope that something
will turn up on the investigation, and his case at this stage remains in the realm of mere surmise. 10.  Further, Mr Yu already obtained from the BVI court, the forum where the Respondent is incorporated, an order for documents to be
provided by Mr Yang, which covers the same scope of the documents sought in these proceedings.  Mr Yang has made disclosure of some
of the documents and has filed an affirmation to state that he is not in possession of any other documents.  As Mr Yang rightly pointed
out, if Mr Yu contends (and can establish) that there are further documents in existence and in Mr Yang’s possession, he can take
further action in the BVI court to compel discovery or for contempt. Bearing in mind the underlying objectives of the CJR, I am not
satisfied that an order for discovery of the type now sought is either necessary in these proceedings for disposing fairly of the
cause or matter, or for saving costs, or is in any way proportionate, or procedurally economical. 11.  I agree that the wide and unwarranted scope of the discovery sought, on suspicion and speculation, lacking in particulars of the
fraud, collusion and breach of fiduciary duties alleged, shows that the application made is an unwarranted fishing expedition and
an abuse of process, which is dismissed with costs, to be paid by Mr Yu.",(Mimmie Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/1868.html,"Mr John Litton QC and Mr Michael Lok, instructed by CL Chow &

In any event, bearing in mind that (as held in Kamy Town) the burden is on Jin and the Applicant (acting through Jin) in this case to establish that these proceedings were commenced with
the authority of the Applicant, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Jin, simply as being the registered Legal Representative,
was authorized by the Applicant to commence these proceedings and to make the Subject Application.  I am not persuaded that the distinction
sought to be made by Mr Wong, as to the validity of Jin’s registered status vis-à-vis the public including LS, serves any real
purpose on the facts of this case.  As the Mainland court decided in Case No 20 of 2014, the resolutions of the shareholders and
directors of the Applicant will bind Jin as shareholder, and Q’s status as the newly appointed Legal Representative is valid vis-à-vis
the former director and shareholders of the Applicant including Jin.  It is precisely Q, W and H who are disputing Jin’s authority
as the Applicant’s Legal Representative in this case, as evidenced by (inter alia) W’s affirmation reflecting the stated position
of the board of directors of the Applicant.  I also fail to see how the act and decision of the registered legal representative of
a company can override the decision of the board of directors of the company as to whether legal proceedings should be continued. 31.  For all the above reasons, I set aside the Leave Order, the Judgment and the garnishee order to show cause.  Once the Leave Order
is to set aside for material non-disclosure, the consequence is that the Judgment and the garnishee order cannot stand and should
be set aside.  Setting aside these orders are the appropriate and inevitable remedy, upon deciding that the action was not authorized
and should be brought to an end.  32.  The costs of and incidental to the 2/18 Summons are to be paid to the Respondent by Jin, who purported to act on behalf of the Applicant.
 LS were informed by the 2/2 Letter as to Jin’s lack of authority and the resolutions of 23 August 2017 and 4 September 2017.

There is one other problem in Mr Leung’s application in HCAL 1160/2018 for interim relief that I should mention. The Legco President
is named as the respondent to the application, and the relief sought is an order for a “stay of execution” of the Bill.  I am
given to understand that, by seeking a “stay of execution” (暫緩執行) of the Bill, Mr Leung is asking the court to grant
an order to restrain the coming into force of the Ordinance.  That being the application, it seems obvious that the proper respondent
to the application should be the Secretary for Transport and Housing, who is empowered by Section 1(2) of the Ordinance to appoint
a day for the coming into operation of that Ordinance by notice, or the Government of the HKSAR.  In this regard, it should be recognised
that the Secretary for Transport and Housing is not a subordinate of the Legco President, and does not act under his order or direction.
 Once the Bill has been passed by the Legco, the Legco President has no further role to play in relation to the coming into force
of the Ordinance.  In my view, it is clear the application for interim relief should not have been made against the Legco President.
 I should mention, to be fair to Mr Leung, that he made it clear, at the hearing as well as in a previous letter dated 2 August 2018,
that he was not seeking any order against the Legco President personally by the present application, although he maintained that
the Legco President was responsible for the passing of the Bill in the Legco. 23.  In all, I have reached the clear conclusion that the applications for interim relief should be refused. 24.

that the Company was required to convene an annual general meeting and lay before the Company audited financial statements for the

It, therefore, follows that even if my construction of the charge is incorrect, as a matter of common law, the proceeds of the sale
would be treated as subject to the charge created over the underlying asset.  This being the case, it follows that the payment on

RE LEUNG LAI CHING MARGARET [2018] HKCFI 1910; HCB 771/2018 (23 August 2018),"Ms Tara Liao, instructed by Ho & Associates, for the petitioner","15.  This cannot be what the statutory framework permits as a valid ground for not making the bankruptcy order in relation to a debt
which is payable immediately. 16.  Whilst a bankruptcy order, by operation of law, has its consequence on the transactions of the debtor, and thus the agreements she
has entered into with the Mainland third party, it is not apparent from the terms of those agreements that this per se must frustrate
the deal from the point of view of the debtor’s Mainland counterpart.  If the transaction is proved to be genuine and has the potential
as projected by the debtor, I am sure the trustee in bankruptcy will engage in the necessary investigation and take the necessary
step to ensure that this could benefit the creditors and the estate of the debtor in her bankruptcy. 17.  I therefore found it right to make the usual bankruptcy order with costs, including costs reserved, to be taxed if not agreed. 
For the avoidance of doubt, I put on record the undertaking of the petitioner to give up such security that he still holds in the
form of shares in a number of the debtor’s companies subject to the charging order obtained by the petitioner in 2016 and not covered
by the subsequent order for sale.  They were set out in the schedule to the amended petition.",Date of Reasons for Judgment: 23 August 2018(Simon Leung),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/1910.html,The debtor appeared in person,in person,tara liao,Ho & Associates,,unknown,

wastage of implementation costs which may be incurred by the Authority and other market participants referred to in paragraph 17(3)

for the failure to adduce the new documentary evidence earlier since the grant of probate in May 2017.  However, the fact was that
the application was rendered unnecessary.  The costs occasioned by such an application to YH would not be rendered futile, as the
same documents would presumably be covered by discovery in the writ action.  I therefore also make no order as to costs of this summons. 37.

at large.  A genuine identity card is a key prerequisite for many commercial or financial transactions in Hong Kong.  Many serious
crimes can be committed using someone’s identity card or just a copy of it. The magistrate had all the reasons to enhance the sentence

There is no reason why costs should not follow event. Mr Chan SC submits (and I agree) that in view of Regal Shining (CFI) handed down in October 2014 and Regal Shining (CA) handed down in November 2015, there is no reason for P to persist in its construction of GC 15. This is particularly so when the
plaintiff in Splendid Resources Inc v Secretary for Justice (which was handed down on 10 March 2017)[24] wisely conceded that the placing or storing of human ashes in jars or containers on the land in question (sold by public auction
in 1932 which was earlier than the sale of the Subject Lots by public auction in 1941 and 1949) contravened GC 15.[25] 73.  Mr Chan SC argues there is simply no basis for P to persist on its interpretation and construction of GC15 in face of Regal Shining (CFI), Regal Shining (CA) and Splendid Resources Inc, and to only make concession that Regal Shining (CA) is binding on this court at trial, especially when P has been legally represented all along. It is said that such stance in face
of binding legal authority is contrary to the underlying objectives of reasonable proportionality in the conduct of court proceedings.
In my view, there is force in such argument, and certainly the efforts by D and her legal team in preparing her defence on such issue
(including preparing written skeleton submissions for trial) have been wasted. 74.  I therefore grant a costs order nisi as follows:","SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE

The petitioner had indeed put a nil value on the shares in the petition pursuant to s 6B(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 6).  The respondent did not argue that such estimates were a sham or that the statutory demand (which also estimated a nil value)
failed to comply with rule 44(5) of the Bankruptcy Rules, despite the fact that Cheng Hung Kit v Tsoi Chik Sang Lawrence [2018] HKCA 396, a recent decision concerning that rule, had been mentioned by Mr Oh on behalf of the petitioner to be distinguished.
 In any event it is well established that the petitioner is bound by the estimated value of the security put in a petition, and cannot
take any benefit in the administration of the bankruptcy except on the basis of that estimate. 6.  Mr Yim asserted that if the shares had been realised earlier at the time of the default, the proceeds of sale would have been sufficient
to meet the outstanding indebtedness. There was no evidence to support this, or even any numbers obtained from publicly available
sources. But this was in any event quite immaterial, as there was no arguable case that the petitioner breached any duty in not selling
the shares at that time.  So far as the statutory demand was concerned, rule 44(5) required the demand to state the value of the security as at the date of the demand.  As at that date (namely, 15 March 2018), the
shares had of course long been suspended from trading.  7.  For these reasons, I did not see any point in having expert evidence as submitted by the respondent.  The usual bankruptcy order
was accordingly made.","Ex-Parte:

by the court.  I am afraid that it was not the case.  The quantum of the Plaintiff’s case was scrutinized by the court before Judgment
was given despite the absence of the Defendants. 9.  There is considerable force in Ms Lok’s submissions that if the Judgment is to be set side it would entail another 10-day trial
and obvious delay to the resolution of these matters.  Such a situation would simply be unjust to the Plaintiff. 10.  For these reasons, I would not accede to the application for a stay of execution.","(1)   EVERWIN SHIPPING (HONG KONG) COMPANY LIMITED;

the provisional liquidators’ costs of the hearing on 27 August 2018, and also the provisional liquidators’ costs of the affirmation
sent to the court on 29 August 2018.  If the Company’s solicitors wish to contest the order, they should file a notice to that
effect with the court within 20 clear days.  If they do not, I will make a final order. 8.  The difficulties that have arisen in this case show the importance of solicitors getting clear instructions from their clients in
relation to ex parte applications of this sort, and making sure that those instructions are passed on to counsel.  The way in which this matter has proceeded
has wasted a considerable amount of the court’s time as well as other parties’, and I would urge solicitors in similar cases

Master A Ho did not make the orders as stated on the sealed orders.  The comments or observations made by Master A Ho did not form
part of his orders and do not, in my view, have to be included in the sealed orders. 24.  In all, the 10th Plaintiff’s appeal has no merit and is rejected. 25.  For the foregoing reasons, the two Notices of Appeal dated 24 April 2018 and 4 July 2018 respectively are dismissed with costs to

The above is the sum total of Mr Kan’s evidence in support of the Summons.  He did not verify the receipt of the requests, the
existence of the customers concerned, or how those requests were generated.  Nor didhe attempt to explain the accounting system of
the defendant which recorded and generated the “history reports”.  I have reproduced above what PM&T said in their reply
dated 28 August 2018 concerning the “history reports”.  Not even those matters have been confirmed by affirmation. 18.  In paragraph 10 of Kan’s 7thAffirmation, Mr Kan talks about funds “which belong to the customers and held in the trust account”.  He has failed to explain
what “the trust account” is.  During a previous hearing, I enquired with Mr Chan, counsel for the defendant, as to whether all
clients’ monies were held in trust account or accounts.  If they were, the identification of those funds would have been straightforward.
 I was informed that they were unfortunately not.  If Mr Kan is now saying that they were, he ought to provide details. 19.  Given the state of the evidence, Mr Chan sensibly accepts that the Summons is not adequately supported by the evidence.  He seeks
leave to withdraw the same.  In the circumstances, and for the reasons set out above, I grant the defendant leave to withdraw the

In all, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiff’s proposed appeal has a reasonable prospect of success, or there is any other reason
in the interest of justice why the appeal shall be heard. 28.  For the foregoing reasons, the Leave Summons is dismissed, with costs to the Defendant. 29.  The parties are agreed that costs should be assessed summarily.  I have considered the Defendant’s Statement of Costs handed up
by Mr Chan at the conclusion of the hearing.  I do not propose to examine the items of costs individually.  I agree with Mr Lai’s
observation that counsel’s fee is plainly excessive.  The hearing was set down for 1 hour only, although it eventually lasted a
bit longer than that.  The application is a simple and standard one.  The Defendant’s counsel appeared before both Master S Kwang
and Deputy High Court Judge Saunders on essentially the same matter, and should be thoroughly familiar with the issues.  It would
take, in my view, no more than a few hours for a hypothetical, reasonably competent, junior barrister to properly prepare for the
hearing, including drafting the short written submissions of the Defendant.  Mr Lai, a very experienced barrister, asked the court
to allow only the fee that he himself charged.  While I cannot help but take note of Mr Lai’s fee, as a matter of principle the
fee paid by the other party should not be used as a yardstick when assessing counsel’s fee (see Ngan Wun Yeung v Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society, Kowloon and Others [1999] HKCFI 1237; [2000] 2 HKC 404, at 417). I therefore do not accept Mr Lai’s submission and will assess Mr Chan’s fee independently.  Solicitors’ costs are
also excessive.  In particular, the time spent on communications with clients and counsel seems to be disproportional, and there
should not be any need for the solicitors to do any “research” in the present case.  Overall, I would assess counsel’s fee
at $60,000 and solicitors’ costs at $30,000, making a total of HK$90,000, which is already a very substantial amount of costs for
resisting a simple application for leave to appeal.","CHUNG CHEUK HUNG, HERO

of the statute. 34.  The Liquidators submitted that just as ad valorem fees under the CFPO are not payable in respect of realisations made after a compulsory winding up has been converted into a creditors
voluntary winding up under s 209A, so also realisations made during a voluntary winding up should not attract ad valorem fees notwithstanding a subsequent compulsory winding up.  But there is no real symmetry.  Once a company is put into compulsory winding
up, the winding up becomes subject to all facets of the compulsory regime.  On the correct interpretation of the statutory scheme,
the ad valorem fees are not being charged on realisations by the voluntary liquidators during the voluntary winding up; they are charged on the
amounts realised and brought to credit within the compulsory winding up. 35.  For all these reasons, the Liquidators’ summons will be dismissed.  There is no dispute that the costs of the Liquidators and

The Court has power to grant an injunction against a defendant described not by name, but by reference to his conduct provided that
the description is sufficiently certain to identify those who are necessarily included and excludes those who are not: see Billion Star Development Ltd v Wong Tak Chuen [2012] HKCFI 142; [2012] 2 HKLRD 85, at paragraph 54 per Au J, and Bloomsbury Publishing plc v News Group Ltd [2003] EWHC 1205;  [2003] 1 WLR 1633 at paragraphs 15 – 22 per Sir Andrew Morritt VC. 5.  I have considered the description of the 2nd defendants.  On the Writ they are described as “Persons unlawfully occupying or remaining at the Open Piazza of Times Square, 1 Matheson Street, Causeway Bay by busking or any other form of street performance, or persons who cause,place or leave obstruction(s)
at the Open Piazza in connection with the carrying out of such performances”.  I am satisfied that the description is sufficiently
certain.  Given the fact that the 2nddefendants is a class of persons not described by names, it is obvious that it is impracticable to serve any process or court document
on them in the manner prescribed by the Rules of the High Court.  I am also satisfied that the proposed means ofsubstituted service
(namely (1) in so far as the Writ and the Order permitting substituted service are concerned, by (a) fixing the same securely at
a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza, (b) by advertisement in one local Chinese newspaper and one local English newspaper; and
(c) by posting the same advertisements on the Website of Times Square; (2) in so far as this Summons and all subsequent orders are
concerned (including those which the 1stdefendant is required to serve upon the 2nddefendants), by (a) fixing those court documents securely at a conspicuous place at the Open Piazza; and (b) posting notices of the
same on the website of Times Square) are appropriate and adequate.  I grant the Order sought as amended. 6.  I however make clear that this Order only permits substituted service of the Writ, the Summons and all subsequent documents which
require service.  No injunction against the 2nd defendants has been granted.  That remains to be considered as and when any application for one is made (if one is made).","Date of Decision:

In respect of the second matter relied upon by the Defendant, I accept that the offers are matters relevant to be taken into account
in deciding whether to make an order for indemnity costs.  However, it is also a relevant fact that the Defendant did not succeed
on all issues at the trial.  In particular, the Defendant failed on an issue of fact, ie whether there was a binding contract between
the parties.  In my view, the Defendant’s denial of a binding contract was plainly unmeritorious, and unreasonable on the facts
of the present case.  Without that defence, the whole case would boil down to a simple question of construction, and I do not believe
that the trial would take 3 days to complete. 14.  In all the circumstances, I am not minded to vary the costs order nisi made by the Judge. 15.

Ms Cheung raised a further argument that even if a Quistclose trust did arise in the first place, once the funds were paid into court, the designated purpose of the payment was carried out and
any remedy RGL and Casey Au had would be the ordinary one in debt: Twinsectra, §69.  Ms Au responded that where money is borrowed specifically and exclusively for the purpose of giving security for costs in
legal proceedings, giving rise to a Quistclose trust, such a trust does not necessarily vanish when the money is paid into court.  In Common Professional Examination Board ex parte Mealing‑McCleod [2000] All ER (D) 588, money was borrowed by the applicant from a bank for the exclusive purpose of giving security for costs in her litigation against
the Board.  After the applicant had won the litigation and obtained a favourable costs order, the Board applied for the money to
be paid out to satisfy costs orders made in other proceedings against the applicant.  The English Court of Appeal held that it was impermissible, because on the facts the money was subject to
a Quistclose trust when borrowed and, by necessary implication or as a matter of construction, it was a condition that if the applicant was successful
in the litigation, the money would go back to the bank, and the applicant was therefore bound as trustee to return the money to the
bank.  As it is unnecessary for my decision, however, I do not express any view on this argument. 28.  No submission has been made as to why the court should not make absolute the charging order if the two points raised are rejected.
 For the above reasons, I am satisfied that a charging order can be imposed on the funds in court standing to the credit of the action
HCA 1285/2014, for the payment of the judgment debts owed by Chris Au to the plaintiff herein, subject to the deemed security interest
of Kim.  I am also satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to make absolute the charging order and there will therefore
be an order in terms of the draft placed before me. 29.  There will be an order that Chris Au do pay the plaintiff’s costs of the application, to be assessed in a gross sum.  The plaintiff
shall forthwith provide its statement of costs to Chris Au; a statement of objections, if any, shall be lodged by Chris Au within
14 days thereafter, and a reply by the plaintiff within 7 days thereafter.",(Godfrey Lam)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2297.html,"Ms Elizabeth Cheung, instructed by Herbert Smith Freehills, for the

starting point even if the magistrate had followed the practice suggested in GurungLaxman.  Had there been a separate “simple possession” charge in relation to Exhibit P4, it is almost certain that its sentence would
be imprisonment rather than other forms of punishment; and that its prison term would be served concurrently with the sentence of
the “trafficking” charge.  I see no injustice caused to the appellant.  In fact, the appellant received an additional 15% discount
for self-consumption in relation to Exhibit P4, despite its quantity not being a significant portion of the narcotics found in the
present case[5]. 22.  The appellant should consider himself fortunate that the magistrate did not enhance the sentence based on his immigration status
[6] . Drugs-related offences (especially “trafficking”) clearly have a serious detrimental effect on the community at large.  As
correctly pointed out by Mr Cheng, the magistrate had all the reasons to enhance the sentence and should have perhaps done so. 23.  The sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment imposed by the magistrate is not a day too long for the appellant.  I see absolutely no
reason to interfere with it.  The appeal against sentence is also dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

only be determined after a full trial. 20.  In light of the aforesaid, I dismiss the Summons. 21.  The parties agreed that costs should follow the event. Costs of the Summons (including costs of the hearing on 19 April 2018) are
to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs, to be taxed if not agreed.","Date of Decision:

It is also not necessary for me to consider the other supplemental arguments advanced by the parties, such as: (i) whether the ownership
of the IRC Shares had passed to Prosper Talent upon the making of the Share Charges; and (ii) whether Prosper Talent was in contempt
by disposing the IRC Shares which were actually held in the name of Benefit Ahead, whereas the Injunction order only referred to
IRC Shares held in the name of General Nice Development. 52.  Apart from granting an order for variation of the Injunction as sought by Prosper Talent, I also make a costs order nisi that: (i) Prosper Talent’s costs of this application be paid by the Plaintiff on an indemnity basis; and (ii) the Defendant shall
bear his own costs of the variation application.  The order nisi shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Decision. 53.  I am grateful to counsel for all the assistance they have provided to this court.","Date of Judgment:

applicationfor specific discovery in the present case) that their computer time recording system is not reliable, and was not relied on as an exhaustive record of time spent.  Where the reliability of the Further Bills is itself called
into serious question, the possibility of that consideration constituting “special circumstances” as would warrant the grant
of leave for taxation cannot be excluded. 53.  The prejudice point is not fanciful.  It reinforces the conclusion that the technical defences belatedly raised should not be allowed
to be advanced. 54.  Accordingly, for all the reasons stated above, the appeal must be allowed with costs (to be taxed if not agreed), and with certificate
for two counsel.","81144

I appreciate that, depending on the timing of the hearing of the appeal, the outcome of the appeal, and (assuming that the appeal
shall be successful) the information which may be derived from the full, unredacted, version of the Plum Report and possibly other

with the consequence that the hearing in February 2019 may be derailed.  This will be regrettable.  There are, however, a number
of different possible scenarios which it is not possible to predict at this stage with any degree of accuracy.  I do not consider
that I should refuse to grant leave to appeal on the mere possibility that the substantive application may not be able to be heard

by Director of Legal Aid, for the Defendant","40.  I do not accept Mr Ng’s evidence that Madam Lee ever represented to him that (i) if he would repay the loans, or continue to repay
the loans after Chi Chiu stopped making repayment, she would give him the Property after her death, or (ii) whoever (meaning or including
Mr Ng) repaid the loans would be entitled to the Property after her death.  I also find that Mr Ng has failed to prove the case against
Madam Lee as advanced by him in the Statement of Claim. 41.  Before I end this judgment, I would add the following observation.  This is a case where the Property has been transferred to Madam
Ng’s sole name for nearly 30 years.  If Mr Ng’s claim in respect of the Property is true, he has been sitting on his rights for
many years.  He fully repaid the loans to Liu Chong Hing Bank Limited no later than early 2006. He did not, however, commence this
action until June 2015 when, on his own account, Madam Lee has been disregarding his rights since about mid-2006.  In the meantime,
Madam Lee has become mentally incapacitated, thereby preventing her from giving oral testimony at the trial.  Mr Ng’s delay is
of course not fatal to his case, but it makes the court’s task more difficult in determining the true arrangement or agreement
between the parties which was not fully documented.  In my view, when the court is being asked to find that the registered owner’s
title to a property is subject to some oral trust or arrangement in such circumstances, the court must act cautiously, and should
look for clear and convincing evidence before upholding the alleged trust or arrangement. 42.  For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff’s action against the Defendant is dismissed, with costs to the Defendant (including all
reserved costs) to be taxed if not agreed.

If Neway Group has no defence to this action, then it is futile to stay the action pending the tribunal’s decision in the CT2
proceedings.  Furthermore, this action deals with Universal’s claim from 1 July 2015 whilst the CT2 proceedings only deal with
the grant of a licence under the HKKLA scheme that that ended on 30 June 2015.  They do not overlap.  The order to be made in the
CT2 proceedings will also not affect Universal as it is not a party to those proceedings and HKKLA was not its agent in operating
the expired scheme.  To allow the action to proceed will also not result in wastage in time and costs as there is no overlap between
this action and the CT2 proceedings.  It will also cause injustice to Universal if this action is stayed.  I therefore dismiss Neway
Group’s summons to stay proceedings. 39.  Since I have held that Neway Group has no defence to this action, Universal should be given judgment of this action.  Mr Yan has
objected to an order for Universal to inspect Neway Group’s karaoke servers.  I think that objection is valid and I omit that from
the orders I make.  I order: - 40.  I also make a costs order nisi that Neway Group do pay the costs of this action including the costs of the two summonses to Universal to be taxed on the indemnity
basis with certificate for two counsel.  I order indemnity costs because I regard this opposition by Neway Group as an abuse of process.
 The issues raised by Neway Group in its defence in this action have all been decided in the discharge decision.  Neway Group should
know where it stands.  Furthermore, it is also unreasonable in challenging Universal’s copyright ownership.  There is also the
dispute of delay made by each side against the other.  I do not think there is enough material for me to decide this dispute against
either or both of them. ",(Louis Chan)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2403.html,"Mr Wong Yan Lung SC and Ms Jacqueline Law, instructed by Wilkinson & Grist, for the plaintiff",jacqueline law,philips b f wong,Tony Au & Partners,Wilkinson & Grist,plaintiff,1.0

The crucial point is that these genuine disputes of fact should be resolved at trial, rather than on affidavit evidence. 30.  In light of the aforesaid, I am of the view that granting unconditional leave to defend to the defendant is the appropriate order
to make. 31.  There is no dispute that the plaintiff is a “foreign plaintiff” as he ordinarily resides in the PRC.  Although the plaintiff
referred to the fact that he has a bank account in Hong Kong, there is also no evidence suggesting that he has any meaningful assets
in this jurisdiction.  The only point taken by the plaintiff in respect of this application is on the merits of his claim but given
the conclusion I have reached in the summary judgment application, an order giving the defendant security is inevitable.  Mr Lau

Mr Hariman submitted the factual background set out in the affirmation evidence was by no means complete, and the court had yet
to make findings as to the factual matrix in relation to the MA/SD that would affect the proper construction/interpretation of the
“Outstanding Consideration”, which would inform the correct/applicable method of calculating Interest and Default Interest, so
the interpretation/consideration point should not be resolved at the summary judgment stage.[46] But in light of the above analysis, interpretation/construction of the term “Outstanding Consideration” was clear and unambiguous
from the perspectives of textualism, contextualism and business purpose, and they all point irrevocably towards P’s meaning as
the plain and ordinary meaning that made commercial sense. 113.  In the circumstances, Ds failed to raise any triable issue or arguable defence, and I discern no other reason for trial. The Master
Order was correct, and the Appeal is dismissed. 114.  The Leave Summons and Appeal are dismissed. There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order
nisi that Ds shall pay P costs of and occasioned by the Leave Summons and Appeal (including all costs reserved, if any) to be taxed if
not agreed. Mr Chang asked for certificate for 2 counsel. Whilst I have no doubt Ms Wong rendered helpful assistance to Mr Chang
in presenting P’s case to this court, on the basis of party and party taxation, I am not persuaded the Leave Summons and Appeal
justified two counsel, especially when P had the benefit of helpful submissions and other groundwork done by his legal team (including

be calculated assuming HIBO + 2.5% or based on current market value such as bank reference (HIBO + 2%)”. I cannot see how this

I find no flaws in the magistrate’s reasoning or findings.  In relation to PW3’s evidence,I do not find any of his behaviour
as shown in the CCTV footage remotely indicative of the “planting” allegation made by the appellant.  It is my finding that PW3
did not unwrap anything when he bent down at the metalrailings and that his waving gesture had no significance.  Most importantly,
what he picked up at the metal railing was the cell phone dropped by the appellant and nothing else.  As a juror, the magistrate
is entitled to accept PW2’s evidence that he found Exhibits A and B in the appellant’s right trouser pocket. 19.  Based on the reasons stated above, I see no reason to interferewith the magistrate’s decision.  The appellant’s conviction is

The Third Question is a question of law and/or construction and is, on the face of the it, suitable for determination by the Order
14A procedure.  However, my ability to resolve the Third Question is linked to the conclusion I reached on the First Question.  The
plaintiff seeks an order that it is entitled to exercise the option under clause 2.05 to accelerate the sale and purchase of the
remaining 39 Sale Shares and the remaining SH Loan.  As the option to accelerate is premised upon the enforceability of the Agreement,
the matter cannot be resolved summarily given the conclusion I reached on the First Question. 39.  The main battle between the parties is on the First Question.  The resolution of the Second Question (involving limitation/laches)
is unnecessary if the defendant is successful on the First Question at trial.  The question is one that is not determinative of the
action and which may at the end of the day be an academic.  In the circumstances, despite the strong arguments advanced by the plaintiff,
I decline to determine the Second Question. 40.  In light of my conclusions on the three questions, I will allowthe defendant’s appeal.  The Order of the learned Master dated

of minds.  He, and I, reject the evidence of D1 and D2 and accept the evidence of PW1.  D1 knew exactly what she was doing and went
to the lengths of providing a town gas bill for a property she did not live in.  D2 also knew the ruse, because he lied to PW1 and
he did so, at the outset, during the interview in the restaurant and maintained the illusion thereafter.  There were a number of
proven facts which overwhelmingly suggest that D1 and D2 both intended to defraud the Department and that they did so in a joint
scheme for which D2 was paid and D3 gained an employee. 41.  As to the suggestion that the magistrate acquitted D3 and therefore this court should infer that there could not have been a meeting
of minds as between D1 and D3, this court’s understanding of his reasoning differs from that of the appellant.  The court’s understanding
of his reasoning is that, although she was substantially implicated, the magistrate was not sure beyond reasonable doubt that she
really understood the system.  In order to find a conspiracy to carry out a substantive offence, the magistrate had to be sure that,
at the moment of the agreement, D3 knew what the substantive offence was and intended to commit that substantive offence.  It was
not a conspiracy to employ a FDH but a conspiracy to submit false documentation to the ID.  Whilst the magistrate did not find that
part was made out beyond reasonable doubt because of her background, he nevertheless believed her to be complicit in an agreement
to employ a FDH.  By contrast, D1 was a business woman and would have known the process and D2 was in the business of seeking employment
visas for FDHs.  Neither were ignorant of the system and on D1’s own admission, she purported to be the employer knowing full well
she was not. 42.  Accordingly, this appeal against conviction is dismissed with costs to the Respondent.","Date of Judgment:

Alternatively, I further agree with Mr Chan for the Director’s submission that, in light of Wong Ho Tong, the present judicial review application has become academic, and hence the court should not entertain it.  This is because, given
the Director’s indisputable judgment that the Registered Hut in the present case had been replaced by a new building,[25] the applicant’s squatter registration is liable to be cancelled irrespective of the outcome of this case, and in that event, the
applicant would not have any public law recourse.  In this respect, it is noted that it is the applicant’s own case that the real
purpose of seeking to set aside the Decisions is to seek to have an opportunity to reinstate the Registered Hut.[26] 65.  For the above reasons, the court dismisses this judicial review. 66.  Given that I dismiss the judicial review on the basis of Wong Ho Tong, which was handed down after the substantive hearing of this application, I think a fair and just costs order in the present case
would be no order as to costs.  I therefore further order on a nisi basis that there is no order as to costs of this application (including the costs of the leave application).  The applicant’s own

IN THE MATTER OF NANIK DAYARAM(also known as NANIK DAYARAM HATHIRAMANI)

Before: Master Lui in Court



Date of Hearing: 26 June 2018 
Date of Decision: 20 November 2018

___________________
THE APPLICATION AND BACKGROUND
1.  This is an application (by summons dated 17 May 2017) for suspension of automatic discharge from bankruptcy for a period up to 4
years by the Joint and Several Trustees in bankruptcy (“Trustees”) of Nanik Dayaram (“Dayaram”), pursuant to section 30A of the Bankruptcy Ordinance, Cap 6 (“the Ordinance”).
2.  Dayaram was adjudged bankrupt on 13 June 2013 as a result of a petition dated 7 December 2011 presented by a creditor, namely the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (“HSBC”). But for this application and the interim suspension orders, Dayaram
would have been discharged from bankruptcy on 13 June 2017. Mr Osman Mohammed Arab and Mr Wong Kwok Keung of RSM Nelson Wheeler Corporate
Advisory Limited were appointed the Trustees on 23 July 2013by a resolution passed at the first meeting of creditors.
3.  Dayaram submitted his Statement of Affairs to the Official Receiver’s Office on 15 July 2013 and his Preliminary Examination of
Bankrupt to the Trustees on 8 November 2013. He said that he did not own any stocks, shares, bonds, unit trust and other financial
securities in his Preliminary Examination of Bankrupt. He, however, disclosed the following assets in his Statement of Affairs:-

(a) HK$71,907.72 (cash in banks);
(b) Investment in stocks and shares in Days International Limited (incorporated in Hong Kong) (in compulsory liquidation) (“Days
International HK”); and
(c) Membership of Hilltop Country Club.

4.  Following the appointment of the Trustees, they started the usual investigation and raised many round of enquiries with Dayaram
by sending him written requests for information and documents.
5.  As at the date of the present application (17 May 2017), according to the Trustees, the total value of the proofs of debt submitted
were over HK$ 221 million and USD$ 39 million.
6.  On 11 August 2015, Dayaram was convicted by a jury of nine counts of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment,
which consisted of making and submitting false invoices and false bills of lading to banks, including HSBC, in order to obtain loans
which have remained overdue and outstanding: HKSAR v. Nanik Dayaram HCCC 2/2014 (unreported) 11 August 2015.
7.  Because of the criminal trial, Dayaram had been remanded in custody on 6 August 2015. Although he was later granted bail pending
appeal against conviction and sentence on 24 August 2016, he returned to prison on 19 January 2017 to serve the remainder of his
sentence.
8.  The Trustees make the present application to object the automatic discharge and they rely on the following 2 grounds as provided
for in sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance respectively, that:-

(a) Dayaram has failed to co-operate in the administration of his estate; and
(b) the conduct of Dayaram in respect of the period before and after the commencement of the bankruptcy has been unsatisfactory.

LEGAL PRINCIPLES
9.  Parties are represented by counsel at the hearing and they do not have great dispute as to the legal principles applicable in the
present case. I therefore take the liberty to repeat some of their submissions below for reference.
10.  The applicable legal principles for suspension of time to discharge from bankruptcy under section 30A(3) of the Ordinance are helpfully summarised in following authorities.
11.  In Re Hui Hing Kwok [1999] HKCFI 1878; [1999] 3 HKC 683, Le Pichon J (as she then was), having considered the purpose of sections 30A(1) and 30A(2) of the Ordinance as set out in the Law Reform Commission’s Report on Bankruptcy that led to their enactment, observed that:-

“Rehabilitation in the sense of enabling the bankrupt to resume a normal life in society is a key, if not the key, consideration.
It should only be delayed by a bankrupt’s own failings.”

12.  In Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang CACV 112 & 113 of 2014 (unreported) 30 July 2014, Yuen JA held that:-

“It is well-established that an application for suspension of discharge from bankruptcy should be considered in two stages:
(1) the court should first determine whether one or more of the grounds mentioned in s.30A(4) has been established; and if established,
(2) the court would then move on to consider whether or not, in the exercise of its discretion, a suspension of discharge should be
ordered,

- having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the acts complained of and the post-bankruptcy order
conduct of the bankrupt, and
- bearing in mind the two main objectives of this part of the [the Ordinance]:

(a) the rehabilitation of the bankrupt by allowing him to resume a normal commercial life, as well as
(b)  the public interest in ensuring that the return of the bankrupt to the commercial world would not carry with it an unacceptable
risk to persons who may be engaged in commercial relations with him, and in preserving commercial morality.”

13.  I am also told that it is useful to look at Yuen JA’s comments in Re Leung Yat Tung (the Bankrupt) (No 2) [2007] HKCA 230; [2007] 4 HKC 192 in relation to the failure in co-operation ground that:-

“As the courts have said, a bankrupt is not permitted to adopt a ‘catch me if you can’ approach. He cannot wait and see if the
trustee in bankruptcy manages to piece together the jigsaw of his financial affairs, and then when he is required to answer the trustee’s
questions, try to get away with revealing as little as he can according to the strict letter of the questions. Instead he should
pro-actively reveal the complete picture of his financial affairs to the trustee, and where pieces do not appear to fit, in that
his conduct or transactions appear to be inconsistent, it is for him to explain the inconsistencies and convince the trustee of the
true state of affairs.”;

14.  Mr McLeish, counsel for Dayaram, specifically drew my attention to the reasons given by Yuen JA in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra), in relation to bankrupt’s unsatisfactory conduct, that:-

“7. …… It is now clear that suspension may be ordered only if the pre-bankruptcy order conduct was grave but it need not be
“exceptionally grave”: Tang Kai Mo v Fred Lee  [2008] HKCA 381; [2009] 1 HKLRD 87 , paras. 30-32.”
“8. As to what is meant by “unsatisfactory” pre-bankruptcy conduct, it was held in Lau Chi Kam [Fred Lee v Lau Chi Kam  [2008] HKCA 148; [2008] 3 HKLRD 627 ] (para 10) that the test for determining whether pre-bankruptcy order conduct was unsatisfactory was whether society would be prepared
to condone such conduct without any expression of disapproval. ……”

15.  Mr McLeish also submitted that for appropriate period of suspension of time to discharge from bankruptcy, Yuen JA held in Re Leung Yat Tung (supra) when overturning an order for suspension of the maximum period of four years:-

“In my view, that maximum period should be reserved for the most egregious cases. Whilst the bankrupt was not cooperative in substance,
he at least remained in communication with the OR …”

16.  He also relied on a passage from Totterdell v Nelson [1990] FCA 434;  (1990) 97 ALR 341 (cited by Le Pichon J (as she then was) in Re Li Tat Kong [2000] HKCFI 2116; [2000] 3 HKC 360), in which Burchett J observed that:-

“There may be cases where it would be unfair to a bankrupt to delay his discharge by reason of an incomplete investigation, lethargically
pursued, to the torpor of which he has not contributed.”

DISCUSSION
17.  Mr Lok, counsel for the Trustees, in support of the application, asked me to look at 4 particular incidents, namely:-

(a) Non-disclosure of claim against Days International HK;
(b) Non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Limited (incorporated in Liberia) (“Days Impex Liberia”) and Days Impex Limited
(incorporated in Hong Kong) (“Days Impex HK”) (both in compulsory liquidation); and
(c) Dissipation of shareholdings in some related companies to associated parties; and
(d) Dissipation of contributions from Mandatory Provident Fund (“MPF”) Scheme.

Non-disclosure of Claim against Days International HK
18.  First of all, the Trustees relied on the non-disclosure of the Dayaram’s claim against Days International HK, a company incorporated
in Hong Kong which is currently in liquidation under HCCW 299 of 2011. Mr Lok submitted that Dayaram only mentioned about the claim
on 27 December 2013 when prompted by the Trustees on 23 December 2013 and the claim was not stated in the Statement of Affairs filed
by Dayaram dated 15 July 2013. The claim was in the sum of HK$4,744,239.20 and was not disclosed prior to this request. Mr Lok submitted
that Dayaram has remained largely unhelpful in relation to the Trustee’s investigation. The paucity of information provided is
unacceptable and this is particularly so given that Dayaram was a director and shareholder of Days International HK.
19.  Dayaram explained that provisional liquidators were appointed for Days International HK by the court on 14 September 2011. The provisional
liquidators seized all company assets and documents. He said that he was excluded from the company’s premises save that he was
permitted to collect personal items and effects. Furthermore, at the creditors’ meeting held on 18 January 2012, Dayaram’s claim
of HK$4,744,239.20 was reduced to HK$1 for voting purposes.
20.  Dayaram further explained that the reason he did not initially inform the Trustees of this claim was because the claim had already
been rejected and he did not consider that there was any realistic prospect of recovery in any event.
21.  Mr McLeish argued that there might be some substance to the Trustee’s allegation if there was any basis for suggesting that Dayaram
could possibly have believed that the claim could result in a payment to him given what had occurred. But he submitted that there
was none. Dayaram was misguided in initially omitting to mention the claim, but realistically he had nothing to gain from this so
as to permit bad faith to be imputed to him. In his submissions, Dayaram’s omission did not cause prejudice to the Trustees’
administration.
it is not sufficient for a bankrupt to take a purely passive role. In discharge of his duty, Dayaram needed to take all reasonable
steps to enable the Trustees to obtain all relevant information and understand his affairs promptly, but obviously he was in breach
of this positive duty. It is not a matter for Dayaram to decide what should be investigated by the Trustees. I also notice that Dayaram
was the director and shareholder of a number of companies.  He is a sophisticated businessman with ample experience in the commercial
world and therefore he knows far better than anyone else the importance of the disclosure at an early stage. All in all, I agree
with the Trustees that this amounts to failure to co-operate in administration of the estate.
Non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK
23.  Now, I turn to another incident relied on by the Trustees, namely the non-disclosure of shareholding in Days Impex Liberia who,
in turn, was the controlling shareholder of Days Impex HK.
24.  Dayaram explained that he ceased to be the sole shareholder of Days Impex Liberia, and hence ceased to have any interest in Days
Impex HK several months before the bankruptcy order. He said that “the ownership of Liberian companies is by way of bearer shares” and explained how he somehow came to lose his shareholding because of debts owed to a “friend” (who lent him US$250,000) as a result of “high stakes baccarat” in Las Vegas in Christmas 2010. As a result, he later “ceased to own any shares in Days Impex Liberia several months before [he] was declared bankrupt”, namely “about the end of 2012”.
25.  Mr McLeish submitted that as at the time Dayaram completed the Statement of Affairs, Mr Dayaram had no shareholding in Days Impex
Liberia or interest in Days Impex HK. Accordingly, there was no omission as alleged by the Trustees and the complaint of failure
to co-operate under this heading is not made out.
26.  I agree that the mere failure to mention the shareholding in Days Impex Liberia in the Statement of Affairs is not sufficient to
establish that Dayaram was in breach of the duty to co-operate as I accept that at the material time he was no longer the shareholder.
But the Trustees’ complaint went far deeper than that. There is no dispute that, even up to the present moment, Dayaram refused
to provide any information on this “friend” who was the lender and later kept the “bearer shares” of Days Impex Liberia. Dayaram said in his affirmation dated 21 July 2017 that “I am unable to disclose the identity of the person to whom I gave the shares as this would cause considerable difficulties with
his family”. Furthermore, there is also no record whatsoever, contemporaneous or otherwise, to support any of his bare allegations in the entire
incident. Furthermore, Dayaram actually had been a director of Days Impex Liberia for the period 5 years preceding the bankruptcy
petition until 1 June 2013 but no document has ever been provided to prove the resignation.
27.  I agree with Mr Lok’s submissions that although the Trustees have not had a lot of evidence to say that there must be some questionable
or highly problematic transactions yet, in my view, Dayaram had a positive duty to provide the information and evidence for investigation.
 The major problem is that he refused to provide the assistance that the Trustees was entitled to have.
28.  Furthermore, because there was no mention whatsoever by Dayaram of the shareholdings of Days Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK at
all until the present application, the Trustees were unable to carry out their investigation. The information requested was definitely
useful to the Trustees. It would be quite wrong to say now that there might not be much use to look at the shareholdings of Days
Impex Liberia and Days Impex HK as they could be worthless. If bankrupts generally were allowed to delay, or even to refuse, to provide
useful information like this, administration of estate of bankrupts would become an almost impossible mission. I find that this deliberate
act of withholding useful information is a very serious breach of a bankrupt’s duty of co-operation in the administration of his
estate.
Dissipation of Shareholdings in the Related Companies to Associated Parties
29.  I am told that the Trustees were concerned as to the circumstances in which Dayaram transferred his shares in 3 different Hong Kong
companies, namely Days Cyberport Limited (“Days Cyberport”), Malkita Limited and Days Travel Service Limited (“Days Travel
Service”) (collectively the “Related Companies”) shortly after the filing of the bankruptcy petition on 7 December 2011.
30.  According to the Trustees, Dayaram executed a number of share transfers of his shares in the Related Companies on 21 February 2012,
as a result of which each of the transferees became the sole member of the Related Companies. The transferee of the shares in Days
Travel Service and Malkita Limited was Dayaram’s wife, Sheila Dayaram, who further transferred the shares in November 2012 to their
son, Mahesh Dayaram. The transferee of the share in Days Cyberport was Days International Limited, a company incorporated in British
Virgin Islands (“BVI”), of which Dayaram was a director (and was once a shareholder until 2005 or 2006). Dayaram explained to
the Trustees on 11 September 2013 that he was, in fact, holding shares on trust for the respective transferees of the Related Companies
but was unable, upon repeated requests, to produce any relevant information so as to substantiate the explanation being advanced
until almost 2 years later.
31.  Dayaram explained that in fact, he informed the Trustees about these transfers in his first response to their questions following
their appointment in his letter to the Trustees dated 11 September 2013. He said that he was holding the shares on trust for the
transferees who had requested him to transfer the shares to them. I am told that there was no consideration for these transfers.
He also said that he sent copies of the relevant declarations of trust and transfer requests to the Trustees by post almost 2 years
later on 5 August 2015. However, the Trustees, in reply, said that “they have not received copies of the Declarations of Trust and Transfer Request as alleged.”
32.  Besides giving the explanation above, Dayaram further said that, at the time of the transfers, the companies were all dormant and
none of them had any assets. It was therefore submitted on his behalf that even if Dayaram had had any beneficial interest in the
shares concerned, the transfer would be of nominal value and therefore would not constitute any unsatisfactory conduct.
33.  First of all, even accepting the fact that the relevant declarations of trust and transfer requests were sent by Dayaram to the
Trustees by post on 5 August 2015, I agree with the Trustees that it is highly suspicious to take almost 2 years to come up with
these documents.  I do not accept his explanation for the delay.
34.  Secondly, Dayaram never took the effort to ensure the Trustees received the documents. They were only recently disclosed in the
present application. In my view, this alone amount to failure to co-operate in administration. And I also agree with the Trustees
that “Had the Bankrupt provided the said documents also by e-mail (as per one of his usual modes of communication with the Trustees)
the Bankrupt would have at least be able to provide electronic record of the same”. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support that he “sent copies of these documents to the Trustees by post on 5 August 2015, with a covering letter”.  It is not in dispute that the duty is on the bankrupt to make full and frank disclosure and to proffer all pertinent information. Obviously, Dayaram, as a bankrupt, has failed to do so.
35.  Thirdly, the complaint against Dayaram was indeed about the suspicious transfer of the shares to some associated parties, namely
his wife, his son and a company incorporated in BVI with Dayaram as a director. According to him, although he was no longer the shareholder
of this BVI company at the time of transfer, he never explained who then became the shareholder or who was the beneficial owner of
this company since 2005 or 2006 and the reasons behind all these changes of shareholdings. Although it might be argued that if the
value of transfer was nominal, it might not constitute an unsatisfactory conduct, this is definitely not an answer to his conduct
in failing on his part to co-operate in providing essential information to the Trustees for investigation.
Dissipation of Contributions from MPF Scheme
36.  The Trustees also submitted that Dayaram failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for the spending of HK$1,320,478.04 maintained
at HSBC Life (International) Limited (“HSBC Life”) on or about 25 March 2013, namely after his bankruptcy petition was filed
and around 2 months prior to his Bankruptcy Order was made.
37.  Dayaram admitted that he had withdrawn his entire MPF contributions in March and April 2013. In the letter dated 27 September 2013,
the Trustees requested for transfer of the money to the estate as the MPF contributions vested in the Trustees. Initially, on 12
October 2013, in response to the Trustees’ request, he explained that the funds withdrawn “was already spent before the end of May, 2013.  There is no money remaining in my possession to refund to you”. More than 8 months later, on 30 June 2014, Dayaram purported to explain that the funds had been exhausted as a result of “donations in the dropboxes of Temples”, “cash handouts to poor people living in Government Housing Estates with particular emphasis on elderly and handicapped” and “food handouts to homeless living under flyovers with cash handouts as well”.  As a result, he “fully exhausted HK$1.08 million in the 9 weeks of charity”. There is no information whatsoever other than his bare assertions and there is no way to confirm the truth of the matter.
38.  My special attention was drawn to the initial answer given by Dayaram that the purpose of spending the contribution was not provided.
Later, Dayaram decided to explain and said that he spent the MPF contributions on charity. He then gave a detailed account on how
he made the donations to different parties. As a result, he “fully exhausted HK$1.08 million in the 9 weeks of charity” “plus travelling expenses of approximately 30K” and “there are no receipts for donations”.
39.  Mr McLeish submitted that given the charitable character of the dissipation of the MPF contributions, the test for determining whether
pre-bankruptcy conduct was unsatisfactory is clearly not met. He argued that society would be prepared to condone such conduct without
any expression of disapproval.
40.  With the greatest respect, I do not agree. It is wholly unacceptable and irresponsible for a businessman who donated his assets
for charity when he knew too well that he was insolvent. After the bankruptcy petition was filed and served, Dayaram must have been
aware of the huge liability he had to meet. I am sure that any responsible businessman would not have spent funds like that in a
manner similar to what Dayaram had done. In my view, no one would be prepared to condone Dayaram’s conduct without any expression
of disapproval. Applying the test in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra), this is no doubt an unsatisfactory conduct and I therefore find that the pre-bankruptcy conduct of Dayaram has been unsatisfactory.
In addition, I also find that the initial answer given by Dayaram is an obvious failure in co-operation.
Sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance
41.  All in all, I agree with Mr Lok that Dayaram’s conduct has been unsatisfactory and he has clearly failed to co-operate with the
Trustees.  It appears to me that none of the conduct was relating to poor judgment or misfortune. The 2 grounds as provided for in
sections 30A(4)(c) and 30A(4)(d) of the Ordinance respectively have been established.
The Exercise of Discretion
42.  In exercise of my discretion, I bear in mind the 2 main objectives for the Ordinance set out in Re Lee Raymond Cho Min & Re Lee Priscilla Hwang (supra) for suspension of automatic discharge from bankruptcy. Again, I do not intend to repeat the facts as they are usefully summarised
in the counsel’s submissions. I shall just give my reasons and decision on this matter.
43.  First of all, I was invited to take into account the way that Dayaram arranged his affairs prior to his bankruptcy, which had a
direct bearing on the way that his bankruptcy could be administered. For instance, Dayaram would acquire properties, in his own name,
and then arrange for another corporate entity to take up the actual purchase. Complicated corporate structures were created for carrying
on business or for holding investment including stock and shares or real property for Dayaram and his family. In my view, this made
the work of the Trustees particularly difficult, unless Dayaram was upmost co-operative but unfortunately he was not.
44.  Secondly, I agree with the submissions of the Trustees that there are strong indications to suggest that the arrangements of Dayaram’s
affairs, including the imposition of complicated trust arrangements and corporate structures, could have effectively concealed his
relationship with a group of companies (holding a number of properties in Hong Kong) which on the face of it belonging to his family.
I agree that Dayaram has clearly failed from being full and frank in his disclosure. For this, the Trustees will have to continue
with the investigation because the administration has not been completed. In my view, the attitude adopted by Dayaram is far from
satisfactory and co-operative. Trustees would need more time to investigate to complete a meaningful administration.
45.  Thirdly, I also take into account the serious commercial fraud that Dayaram was involved.
46.  Fourthly, it is quite apparent that Dayaram largely chose to be passive and reactive.  He adopted the “catch me if you can”
approach and only provided information when he was caught and cornered by the Trustees.  And very often, he was unable to provide
documentary evidence to support his explanation.
47.  Fifthly, I agree with Mr Lok that there was no undue delay in administration on the part of the Trustees.
48.  However, when exercise my discretion, I do notice one thing which is in favour of Dayaram. I agree with Mr McLeish that, so far,
the results and the evidence coming out from the investigation of the 4 incidents, relied upon by the Trustees for making this application,
did not seem to show Dayaram did actually conceal any assets, although his unco-operative attitude gave a very strong impression
that he did. I also agree that the maximum period should be reserved for the most egregious cases and I am afraid that this is, although
a very serious one, not one of the most egregious. I therefore do not intend to impose the maximum period of suspension of 4 years.
49.  Given all the circumstances of the present case, I order that the relevant period shall cease to run for a period of 3 years.
50.  I was specifically asked to reserve the decision on costs and so I order.
DISPOSITION
51.  I will make the following orders:-

(a) The discharge of the bankruptcy under section 30A of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap. 6) shall cease to run for a period of 3 years from 12 June 2017; and
(b) Costs be reserved.

52.  Finally, I thank both counsel for their very helpful assistance.

proper, proportionate and reasonable costs of the action, would “fall outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement
is possible”. 6.  The application for leave to appeal is dismissed, with costs to the Plaintiff, to be summarily assessed. The Plaintiff is to serve
its breakdown of costs on the Defendant within 3 days, and the Defendant is to serve and file its objections, if any, within 7 days.","TIM FUNG STEAM LAUNDRY (SHATIN) COMPANY LIMITED

In all of the circumstances therefore I do not believe there was an intention to ignore or flout the Unless Order and I find the
failure to comply with it was the result of genuine extraneous circumstances such that the failure to obey is not contumelious. 33.  In the exercise of my discretion I must have regard to the interest of justice and whilst I accept this cuts both ways I think that
to exclude the defendant’s right to be heard on the Order 14 application outweighs the failure strictly to comply with the terms
of the Unless Order given the facts which have been established.  In reaching this conclusion I am conscious of the fact that the
parties are agreed that, by allowing this evidence to be filed and the plaintiff an appropriate right of reply, there will be no
prejudice to the hearing date which is set for January 2019. 34.  Accordingly in the exercise of my discretion I grant the defendant’s application for relief from the strict requirements to comply

HKSAR v. JOHIR MOHAMMED [2018] HKCFI 2526; HCMA 224/2018 (22 November 2018),The appellant appeared in person,"14.  I have sympathy for people who need to escape from their homeland for various reasons (political, religious or otherwise) to seek
refuge in a foreign territory.  Hong Kong owes those people nothing but has generously extended its hospitality to them.  The bottom
line is they need to behave themselves and obey the law here.  This is certainly not one bit too much to ask for and is the least
those people could do in return for the protection offered to them by Hong Kong. 15.  Ms Chit for the respondent has fairly drawn my attention to the issue of deduction for administrative detention[4].  The appellant was under administrative detention for a period of 36 days in early 2014 when he illegally entered Hong Kong.  In
other words, the administrative detention took place 4 years prior to the present offence. Furthermore, thedetention was unrelated
to the present offence.  As such, it does not trigger the operation of section 67A(1A) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap 221)[5].  The issue of administrative detention was not raised by the appellant's trial counsel during mitigation either.  I simply see no
reason why I should exercise my discretion to reduce the appellant's sentence for the administrative detention. 16.  This appeal has no merits and must be dismissed.","Date of Judgment:

judge was nevertheless entitled to find that Top Catering has failed to discharge its burden of proving the quantum.  His finding
that it would be wrong in principle and artificial to nevertheless allow the amount claimed as if it were a notional sum, in my view,
cannot be faulted. 38.  Top Catering’s application for extension of time to appeal is refused. Following such event, Tasty should have her costs of and
occasioned by this application.  In the absence of application within 14 days to vary this costs order, this shall become absolute
without further order, and upon which Tasty may submit and serve her statement of costs of this application within 7 days and Top
Catering may submit and serve its written comment on the costs claimed within 7 days thereafter.  Costs shall be assessed summarily
and on paper. 39.  I heard the application in Chinese for the parties’ benefit.  Interpreter’s assistance will be arranged to facilitate the parties’

GREENS NURSERY &AMP; TREE PLANTING DESIGN LTD v.

By reason of the above, I answer Issue #4(ii) also in the negative. 124.  Given my findings above, there is no need for me to consider the issue of quantum.  In all cases, the issue of quantum is directly
linked to the nature and extent of breach(es) that the infringing party is found to have committed.  I do not want to consider quantum
on any hypothetical basis.  It is particularly so in the present case where the plaintiff has raised a number of different causes
of action on different bases.  I add only this, that there are a lot of merits in Mr Leung’s submissions to the following effects.
 The evidence given by Mr Wan on the issue of quantum has three major problems: (1) why the plaintiff said the Premises could be
demarcated into 1,000 car‑parking spaces; (2) the monthly rental of each car-parking space, and (3) the failure on its part to
deal with the operating expenses.  I note that the plaintiff has called no expert evidence in those regards.  I see therefore some
merits in Mr Leung’s submission, based on McGregor on Damages, 20thed (2018), paragraph 10-001, that the plaintiff has failed to prove its loss, and that its claim may be dismissed on this basis alone.
 There is however some evidence which suggests that the defendant might have suffered a small loss (in the sum of HK$10,600, being
alleged expenses in engaging contractors for excavation works at the Premises).  The parties also did not address me on the possibility
of nominal damages.  On that basis, and given my earlier conclusions, I decide to dismiss the plaintiff’s claim on its failure
to establish those framed issues on liability.  I make no findings on the issue on quantum before what I have discussed in this paragraph.
 125.  For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in its entirety.  I make a costs order nisi that the defendant shall have the costs of the action, to be taxed if not agreed.

 for the 1st Defendant","9.  As earlier mentioned, in the course of her reply submissions, Ms Chan sought a revised form of injunction, namely, that the 1st and 2nd Defendants be restrained from proceeding with the public auction of the Mortgaged Properties (i) on 26 November 2018 or (ii) earlier
than 10 December 2018 unless (a) the completion date is at least 10 weeks from the date of the auction, or (b) it is with the prior
written consent of the Plaintiff, or (c) it is sanctioned by an order of the court.  It appears that the focus of the complaint under
this revised formulation of the injunction is now shifted to the completion date.  However, it remains the case that, if the Mortgaged
Properties will not be sold for less than their market values, there cannot, in my view, be any real objection to the proposed auction
taking place on next Monday or on any other date.  I do not therefore consider that the revised formulation of the injunction meets
the substance of the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ objection to the application. 10.  In all, I am not minded to grant the interim injunction sought by the Plaintiff.  Depending on the result of the auction, there
may or may not be any useful purpose for the Plaintiff to further pursue the summons.  I do not therefore propose to give any directions

not find them to be directly relevant to exercise of my discretion whether or not to grant leave to amend.  Even if marginally relevant,

there is special reason not to follow the usual rule.  While counsel for the respondents rendered little assistance in the issue

such that the respondents should be penalized by costs.  Indeed, the appeal would have been dismissed even if the issue raised by

the Yau Tong Property, there will be a conflict of interest on the part of Harbour Front as a director of Fonfair as well as a potential
purchaser; and with grant of the prohibitive injunction the Court would effectively sanction theconflict of interest.  I disagree.
 First, the articles of association expressly allow a director to deal with the company after appropriate declaration of interest.
 Second, which is more important, Harbour Front has not yet proved its case in these proceedings, and as explained above, at this
interlocutory stage the Court will not grant any substantive right to Harbour Front to participate in the management of the company’s
affairs including obtaining internal information of any potential sale to Harbour Front’s advantage. 53.  In conclusion, for the above reasons, I am prepared to grant the interlocutory relief restraining sale or disposal of the Yau Tong
Property (unless with Harbour Front’s prior approval or consent) pending determination of the Petition or further order of the

Materially, even if Wong has prospects of establishing her claim of forgery, I agree with Counsel for the Plaintiff that she has
no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim against her as a partner of the Firm, on the basis of the 1st Facility Letter signed by the 1st Defendant - Wong’s partner at the material time of the loan.  It is not disputed by Wong that she signed the account opening form
with the Plaintiff, purporting to be a partner of the Firm, and that she was held out to the Plaintiff, and to the world at large,
as a partner of the Firm.  The 1st Defendant, as partner, would have the usual authority to sign documents on her behalf for the Firm.  Wong’s assertion that as a
non-equity partner, it was understood and agreed between the 1st Defendant and herself that she would not be liable for the debts and liabilities of the Firm, as she was not responsible for the
profits and losses of the Firm, is no answer to the claim made by the Plaintiff, a third-party dealing with the Firm and to whom
Wong was held out (with her consent) to be a partner.  At most, Wong would be entitled to seek indemnity from the 1st Defendant.  23.  The Statement of Claim pleads (paragraph 1 (b)) that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were trading as the Firm. It makes it clear that the loans were made to, received and utilised by the Firm pursuant to
the Facility Letters.  Wong disputes her signatures on the documents relied upon by the Plaintiff in her evidence filed in support
of her application to set aside the Judgment, but if, after considering the merits of the Plaintiff’s case, Wong has no real defence
to the claims made against her as a partner for the debts of the Firm, there is no point to the setting aside, and no injustice in
the exercise of the discretion of the Court, not to set aside the regular judgment.  24.  For these reasons, the appeal against the Master’s refusal to set aside the Judgment is dismissed, with costs to the Plaintiff,

Costs are in the discretion of the Court (see section 52A of the High Court Ordinance, Cap 4 and Order 62, rule 2(4) of the Rules of the High Court).  Order 62, rule 5(1) deals with matters to be taken into account by the Court in exercising its discretion as to costs.  They include the underlying objectives
set out in Order 1A, rule 1; and whether a party has succeeded on part of his case.  In view of the above, I consider a fair exercise of the discretion is to
make no order on the costs of the application. 28.  I make the following orders on the application:","CHAN WAH TAT CARLMEN formerly trading as SUN SHING HING SHIPYARD

SIU CHI TAT ALSO KNOWN AS CHI TAT SIU v. LAND ZONE LTD [2018] HKCFI 2582; HCA 1670/2018 (30 November 2018),"Mr Duncan Ho, instructed by Sanny Kwong & Co, for the defendant   ","30.  In the circumstances I have concluded that an injunction is theappropriate way forward.  The risk of detriment or inconvenience
to P is sogreat that it seems to me just that the court should act to protect P’s positionpending trial.  The injunction sought
is of very limited application.  P hasconfirmed that it is prepared to erect a padlocked gate with fencing blocking any access to
D’s lot through the proposed opening if D requests this. 31.  I am conscious too in exercising my discretion in this way that throughout the period of the dispute and for many years before that
D’s lot has been deserted and in particular nothing has been stored or placed on the disputed land.  As a result it seems to me
that the injustice which will be caused to P if the injunction were to be refused far outweighs any inconvenience which would be
caused to D if the injunction is granted.  Whilst the delay in seeking the court’s assistance is a factor to be taken intoaccount,
I do not think that it should be the predominant factor in deciding whether or not it is just and fair to grant the injunction. 32.  I would only add that it is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an accommodation pending trial to avoid the
time and costs expended so far.  In the circumstances I make an order nisi for D’s costs in the cause.","LAND ZONE LIMITED (立崇有限公司)

I, therefore, order P to pay costs of the 1st summons of D1 to D1 and D2’s summons to D2. 31.

not attending to what used to be something that he was very concerned and cared about.  This has nothing to do with the administration
of the estate and I order D1 to pay P indemnity costs on this summons. 32.  Regarding D1’s 3rd summons, part of it is consented to.  So I do not think P should pay costs for that part.  The other part was
opposed successfully and has been dismissed. So, I would order half of the costs of D1’s 3rd summons be in the cause and the remaining
half be paid by D1 to P on party and party basis.  I do not think that is an abuse, although irrelevant.  I, therefore, do not regard

  Zhong Lun Law Firm, for the opposing contributory","4.  It appears to be Ms Li’s case that Dr Chen, who is considerably older than her, had, what I shall describe for want of a better
expression, a romantic interest in her which in the fullness of time, it became apparent she did not reciprocate.  As a result, by
December 2016, when the Company required further cash in order to continue its business, Dr Chen gave Ms Li two choices as to how
he was willing to provide the finance that she thought was required by the Company.  She says that during a business trip to Birmingham,
Dr Chen told her on 2 December 2016 that the choices were either she slept with him, in which case he was prepared to provide additional
finance in the form of capital, or if she did not wish to do so, he instead would lend money to the Company.  Ms Li chose the latter
and as a result, the GBP10 million was advanced, although, as is apparent from what I have said earlier in these reasons, the loan
agreement was back-dated to 23 June 2015.  5.  The argument of Mr Lam, who appeared on behalf of Ms Li, on precisely how these circumstances in some way restricted the petitioner’s
ability to require repayment of the loan was unclear.  However, it seems fairly clear from his submissions, and also the way in which
Ms Li’s case is put both in her affirmation filed in this petition and also the way her case is set out in her own petition when
it deals with the understandings between Dr Chen and herself which led to the formation of the Company, that neither the petitioner
nor Dr Chen was under any obligation to contribute further capital to the Company.  It seems to follow that in these circumstances
the suggestion, and this is what is said to constitute a bona fide defence on substantial grounds to the petition, that the loan was advanced under duress and this provides a defence is simply misconceived
and unsustainable.  6.  I will, therefore, make the normal winding-up order.",(Jonathan Harris)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2789.html,"Mr José Maurellet SC and Ms Jacqueline Law, instructed by

The second matter was the reason for amending the Summary of Facts to delete the name of Hung Chi-him and substituted that with
Ah Him.  According to DC, it was the applicant’s idea to change it.  The reason given by the applicant was that leaving Hung Chi-him
in the Summary of Facts would make him “look like a liar”.  According to the applicant, the suggestion came from PC and since
he had already decided to plead guilty, he did not care whether the full name of Hung Chi-him appeared or not. 35.  As the Summary of Facts only related what the applicant had said during the Video-recorded Interview, whether the name of Hung Chi-him or Ah Him appears, it still remains a fact that the applicant had
said someone else had asked him to collect the parcel.  Leaving the name of Hung Chi-him in the Summary of Facts would not make the
applicant any less a liar.  I accept the applicant’s version of the event.  Again, changing the full name of Hung Chi-him to Ah
Him is to the benefit of Hung Chi-him rather than to the applicant.  It makes no difference to the applicant’s case. 36.  On the evidence before me, I find that the applicant has succeeded in showing that his plea of guilty was entered involuntarily

On the other hand, P’s concerns were real.[69] If the D2 and Amend Summonses as were acceded to now (ie 7 years after commencement of the present action), the parties would have
to return to basics to re-draw their pleadings and engage in interlocutory skirmishes (including further discovery and supplemental/further
witness statements on the business model / Practice and their actual operation as between SKL and P doing back decades, or even expert
accounting evidence[70]) before the present action could be set down for trial. Mr Fong seemed to have assumed P’s affirmation evidence filed for opposing
the D2 Summons would be the sum total of P’s resistance to the Violet Amendments (if allowed). I see no basis for such assumption
when P already alluded to the investigations that would be required. The fact P saw no need to condescend into a debate over the
business model / Practice for the purpose of resisting the D2 Summons would not preclude P from pleading its full array of reply
contentions if the Violet Amendments were allowed. Further, it must not be forgotten that D2 himself was still seeking discovery
from HSBC to fortify the averments in the Violet Amendments. In my view, the delay that was likely to arise would be considerable,
and could take up to a year if not longer (see also paragraphs 112-113 above). This was particularly worrying since (a) the parties
had been at the brink of trial being set down since December 2016, and (b) D2 had been assuring the court even earlier, ie since
2015, that his case was ready for trial. Although there was no trial date as yet, it was clear but for the D2 Summons/Appeal this
action could have been set down for trial upon completion of the D1 Appeal. In the circumstances, although no milestone date was
disturbed, “[in] substance and in effect, it is little different from disturbing a milestone date”.[71] It was plain that if relief was granted in favour of D2, P was bound to suffer procedural/forensic prejudice which could not be compensated

to restore its summons filed on 23 February 2018 for 3-minute hearing before master. But I hope both parties should see the sense
of dealing with such summons by consent in order to save time and costs. 125.  There is no reason why costs should not follow event. I therefore grant a costs order nisi that D2 shall pay P costs of and occasioned by the D2 Appeal to be taxed forthwith on indemnity basis if not agreed.","1456058

As will be apparent from my reasons, it seems to me that the way in which the Respondents have dealt with Mr Tang’s claims, and
his attempts to either have the Company wound up or alternatively have his own interests in it purchased, has been unsatisfactory.
 I would note that I have conducted the various case management conferences in these proceedings at which on a number of occasions
Mr Chain on behalf of Mr Tang has indicated a willingness to settle and outline a basis for progressing discussions.  These have
over time not been responded to constructively. It also in my view is unsatisfactory that despite the fact that well before trial
it is obvious that the Respondents had access to the relevant documents and, in the case of Ms Hui, somebody who could help explain
the ledgers, that the Respondents have continued to make serious allegations against Mr Tang without taking the trouble themselves
to understand the affairs of the Company and its accounts with a view to assessing fairly what the true position is, and how the
parties’ interests can fairly be resolved.  25.  As I have already indicated, it is far too common in the Companies Court for small shareholders disputes to be conducted in this
way, and for the disputes between owners of businesses which it should be possible to resolve relatively easily to be allowed to
deteriorate into rather childish squabbles, which serve no commercial purpose other than to incur legal costs which reduces the value
of the assets available to shareholders. 26.  I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to order that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents pay the Petitioner’s costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis.","AU GARY CHUNG LOK

On 10 November 2017, the Court granted injunctions against the Son, Wang and SC (a company controlled by the Family) in HCA 2509
instituted by Gu and Korchina, whereby they were restrained from disposing of their interests and ownership in the assets of AF including
its shareholding in Alishan.  Korchina and Gu have undertaken to give notice to inform Zhang’s solicitors in writing within 48
hours of any change in respect of these injunctions.  There is no risk of further dissipation of or dealings in the shares in AF
or Alishan.  31.  For all the above reasons, I am not satisfied that Zhang has established any irreparable damage to justify the grant of an interim
injunction.  There is inordinate and unjustifiable delay in the application for injunction by the Summons issued in this action,
as set out in the preceding paragraphs of this Decision.  There is no satisfactory explanation as to why this action has to be instituted,
and why the claims made in this action cannot be pursued in the 2014 Action, which remains ongoing as against AF and Alishan.  Nor
is the injunction sought by Zhang in respect of dealings in the shares in AF and Alishan necessary, when court injunctions and cross-undertakings
are in place in HCA 2509, whereby the Family and Wang have been prohibited from dealing with the AF Shares and the Land.  32.  The Summons is accordingly dismissed, with costs to be paid by Zhang to the Defendants, with certificate for Counsel. ","Date of Reasons for Decision:

Furthermore, in my view, there is no particular need for the adjourned hearing to be fixed in consultation with counsel’s diary.
 HKSBC will not contest the application and will abide by any decision of the court.  BOCHK may have some practicality issues to
argue but in principle is neutral.  The plaintiff had all along been represented by senior and junior counsel.  If the plaintiff
is really so mindful about time, he could dispense with the luxury of having the services of senior counsel.  There is no reason
to doubt junior counsel’s competency in an application of this nature. Had the plaintiff adopted this course instead of seeking
to vary the Order, the application would have, by now, been disposed of.  Probably, the practicality issues could be resolved much
more speedily by agreement instead of by argument with senior counsel before the court.  21.  As for the plaintiff’s application to vary the costs order, it mustbe borne in mind that the issue of costs is within the discretion
of the judge who had conduct of the proceeding.  The hearing on 13 July 2018 was essentially a direction hearing and hearing of the
IS.  Since the plaintiff adopted the wrong procedure and the IS served no purpose, there is no reason why if he succeeds in HCCW
218/2017, the respondents in that case should bear these costs.  It is appropriate that he should be deprived of his costs of thehearing
on 13 July 2018.  Mr Smith SC’s mirror argument has no merit.  Anyway, in HCMP 1721/2017, Madam Justice Lisa Wong reserved costs.
 What was lost in that case was not lost forever.  When the occasion comes for argument on costs, the plaintiff may have strong grounds
based on procedural irregularity to resist Zhang’s application for costs.  In any event, what costs order was awarded in another
case has no bearing on the costs order to be made in this case.  What the court has to do is to make a costs order which is proper
and appropriate.  In my view, the costs order made by Madam Justice Lisa Wong is proper and appropriate and one which the Court of
Appeal will not interfere.  I would also have made the same order myself were I in her shoes.  There is no reason to vary the costs
order. 22.  For the above reasons, the plaintiff’s variation summons is dismissed with no order as to costs.  BOCHK filed a skeleton submission.
 As the submission is more related to the discovery issue and has little bearing on the variation application, it would be more appropriate
to reserve the issue of BOCHK’s costs.",Date of Decision: 19 December 2018(Anthony To),Deputy High Court Judge,/2018/2759.html,"Mr Clifford Smith SC and Mr Kerby Lau, instructed by Titus,

THE INCORPORATED OWNERS OF KAM KIN MANSION [2018] HKCFI 2760; HCA 748/2011 (19 December 2018),"Mr Anthony Cheung, instructed by Cheung & Yeung Solicitors, for the defendant","162.   The covered playground was converted into the units.  According to the expert opinion of the IO’s building surveyor expert which
is accepted by this court, the conversion created an air-tight chamber effect in the units such that any water infiltrated into the
ceiling of the covered playground could not escape into the open air.  That caused or aggravated the damage to the ceiling or other
structures of the unit.  Though the water leakage is not in dispute, the plaintiffs have failed to prove that had the covered playground
not been converted, the leakage will affect the enjoyment of the covered playground as a covered playground.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs’
claim in negligence is dismissed. 163.   The plaintiffs’ claim in nuisance was also launched on a similar false premise that they may increase the liability of their
neighbour by putting the covered playground to an exceptionally delicate or special use.   Given the design, construction and intended
use of LG3 and the covered playground, converting the covered playground into units for domestic use amounted to such exceptionally
delicate or special use in the circumstances.  By adopting the conversion, the plaintiffs upset the balance which has to be maintained
between themselves as owners of the covered playground and the IO as owners of the driveway.   As such, they are not entitled to
damages in nuisance.  164.   In conclusion, the plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with costs.","Conclusion

In so far as the costs of Tomohiro are concerned, the general rule is that an unsuccessful applicant will normally not be required
to pay more than one set of costs where there are two or more respondents appearing (see Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2019, Vol 1, at paragraph 53/14/63).  I see no reason why the same general rule should not apply where the court exercises the power to
hear a party under Order 53, rule 5B.  This having been said, the general rule may be departed from where there are good reasons
to do so on the facts of any given case.  The court’s exercise of discretion in matters relating to costs should remain flexible. 68.  In the present case, the court has benefitted considerably from the assistance rendered by Senior Counsel representing Tomohiro
(Mr Wong Yan Lung, SC).  However, the points raised on behalf of Tomohiro are, I believe, adequately covered by the submissions made
by Senior Counsel representing the Registrar (Mr Horace Wong, SC).  The Registrar is the decision-maker and the party ultimately
responsible for defending the legality of her decision.  While I can understand Tomohiro’s wish to be heard, I do not consider
that to be a sufficient justification to order the Applicant to bear two sets of costs.  Overall, I consider that the fair order
to make would be no order as to costs as between the Applicant and Tomohiro, including the reserved costs of the short hearing on
10 July 2018, and I so order. 69.  Lastly, it remains for me to thank counsel for their assistance rendered to the court.","Date of Judgment:

undisputed Termination of Employment signed by A2 (Exhibit P7) and the termination was not in accordance with s 9 of the EO.  37.  In the circumstances, the convictions against both A1 and A2 were neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory.  The appellants’ appeals

that he had cut his wrist before coming to Hong Kong on his way to Taiwan to see his fiancée.  However, I do not see how that would
serve as proper mitigation in this case.  The fact is it was an opportunistic theft at the time he took the property from the lift.
 It was an opportunistic burglary when he climbed over the glass wall partition to steal the ticket and not only did he do it once,
he did it twice by climbing over that glass partition again and stealing the printer rolls. 12.  His second ground of appeal is that he asked for leniency to reduce the sentence so that he can go back to the UK to deal with matters
needing his attention.  I have to consider whether the learned magistrate had sentenced the appellant manifestly excessively.  As
I have said, when reading the learned magistrate’s Reasons for Sentence, it is clear that the learned magistrate had considered
every matter which was helpful to the defence and arrived at a proper sentence. 13.  I cannot see how in the circumstances the learned magistrate was manifestly excessive in his sentence or wrong in principle.  There

MAN MI SANG AND ANOTHER v. MAN SHEK TONG AND OTHERS [2018] HKCFI 2755; HCA 881/2012 (28 December 2018),"Mr Anthony P W Cheung and Ms Krystal Law, instructed by K M Cheung & Co, for the 1st and 2nd Defendants (by Original Action) and the 3rd Defendant (by Counterclaim)","115.  Though the Plaintiffs have failed to establish their claim against the Defendants in the present case, it does not mean that managers
can conduct the affairs of a tso without any supervision.  But how should the court set the standard for the proper discharge of managers’ duty?  As mentioned by
Mr Kwan, different villages or tsos may have different ways of doing things, and so it would be very difficult for the court to set the proper standard in each case.
 If more cases of this nature are coming before the courts, Government authority must seriously look into this matter and to consider
whether there should be legislations to regulate the management of tso’s affairs.  I appreciate that these are sensitive and tricky issues, but I see no other option if more similar litigations require
the adjudication by the courts. 116.  Despite these observations, the Plaintiffs have failed to prove their case against the Defendants and the claim is therefore dismissed. 117.  I also make an order nisi that the costs of the action be paid by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs to the 1st and 2nd Defendants in the Original Action, which shall be made absolute 14 days after the date of the handing down of this Judgment.","MAN WING SAU TSO (文永壽祖),

As to Certificate for Counsel, it was reasonable, necessary and proper for D2 to engage two Counsel to argue the Summons, given
the law points being relied on.  I certified the engagement of two Counsel. 24.  D2 did not apply for the vacation of lis pendis under Sections 19 & 20 of the Land Registration Ordinance (Cap 128) in the Summons.  I shall leave it to the parties to sort out lis pendis issues, if any, separately. 25.  I thank Counsel for D2 for their most able assistance.","LEI SHING HONG CREDIT LIMITED

the Summons substantively, given the potential consequence of an order being made in terms of the Summons, and the fact that D3 had
himself engaged Counsel.  I granted Certificate for Counsel accordingly. 14.  On the quantum of costs, I examined P’s Statement of Costs and heard both parties’ full oral submissions on it.  In my view,
P’s claim on quantum was only slightly excessive.  Making some slight deductions in relation to the time spent claimed by P’s
solicitors, and allowing Counsel Fee in full, I assessed the quantum of costs payable by D3 for the Summons as HKD 115,000. 15.  I thank both advocates for their able assistance.","CHAN WING TSANG

TIN FOO INVESTMENT CO LTD v. PREVIGOR DEVELOPMENT LTD AND ANOTHER [2018] HKCFI 2870; HCA 1675/2014 (31 December 2018),"Mr Lee Tung Ming, instructed by Lo & Lo, for the 1st and 2nd defendants","14.  Second, the Discovery Summons and Interrogatory 3, which were couched in unnecessarily wide terms, were essentially aimed at obtaining
the same information.  It was a misconceived effort.  They likewise covered a period of time in respect of which the plaintiff makes
no claim for any loss of rental income.  In any event, the reasons for which such information was said to be relevant and necessary
did not stand up to scrutiny.  See paragraphs 25, 26 and 28 of the Decision.  As in the case of Interrogatory 4, the plaintiff could
not be blamed for opposing Interrogatory 4 or the Discovery Summons, as they were drafted. 15.  In the circumstances, a fair costs order should reflect the defendants’ defeat for almost all their requests under the interrogatories
and the Discovery Summons. 16.  For these reasons, I order the defendants to pay 90% of the plaintiff’s costs both below and on appeal.  I fail to see any reason
to distinguish between the proceedings below and before me.  As Master Chow had already summarily assessed the plaintiff’s costs
below at HK$95,000, I will vary the costs order she made by ordering the defendants to pay HK$85,500 (i.e. HK$95,000 x 90%) to the
plaintiff for its costs of the Interrogatories Summons and the Discovery Summons before the master.  To facilitate the summary assessment
of 90% of the plaintiff’s costs of the appeal, I direct the plaintiff to file and serve a statement of its costs within 14 days
from today and the defendants to file and serve their statement of objections (if any) within 14 days thereafter.",(Lisa KY Wong)Judge of the Court of First Instance,High Court,/2018/2870.html,"Mr Paul Wong, instructed by Hon & Co, for the plaintiff",paul wong,lee tung ming,Lo & Lo,Hon & Co,plaintiff,1.0
